00:06.240 --> 00:09.760
NETFLIX PRESENTS

03:00.560 --> 03:03.480
Tell them
to get the fuck out of here. Now.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.200
Bang, bang!

07:13.280 --> 07:16.080
No way! Look at you!

07:16.160 --> 07:17.320
You made it downstairs!

07:18.560 --> 07:20.080
But shouldn't you be resting?

07:21.680 --> 07:24.520
What is it with you and resting?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.840
I've had enough rest
to last me a lifetime.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.360
I'm tired of lying in bed
and having you baby me.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.320
That's hardcore.
It's not even 11:00 yet.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.080
That's bad, even for me.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.360
Need I remind you that you almost died?

07:47.440 --> 07:50.600
-Getting drunk at breakfast is a bad idea.
-For fuck's sake.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.600
Why does everyone suddenly
think they know what I need?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.960
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

08:04.200 --> 08:06.960
I've never been so afraid of losing you.

08:18.000 --> 08:18.840
And Massimo…

08:21.120 --> 08:22.600
…his heart nearly broke.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.560
Olo, I know how hard it was for you
and I know you're worried about me,

08:35.160 --> 08:37.120
but I've been given a second chance.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.240
I want to make the most of it.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.720
Besides, we haven't even toasted
to you changing your mind about marriage.

09:02.920 --> 09:03.920
What?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.080
Nothing.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.840
I'm just happy you're here.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.560
I can't look
at that hair sober.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.640
Excuse me.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.360
Wow.
So you're ready to go, then.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
You just had sex.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.400
And what makes you say that?

13:04.480 --> 13:06.400
You're not wearing any panties.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.760
But that's not the only thing.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.400
Your hair…

13:12.960 --> 13:14.160
and your lipstick.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.640
So what? We bumped into each other

13:16.720 --> 13:17.760
"And I fucked him."

13:19.520 --> 13:20.640
Yes, I fucked him.

13:20.720 --> 13:24.080
Listen, I want to hear
every kinky little detail, got it?

13:25.440 --> 13:29.800
Quit smirking and come help me,
or we'll never get out the door.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.880
I've already got
everything picked out. Here.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
This one?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.960
-Or this one?
-The black one.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.320
-Hey! Stop!
- Tell me everything.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.360
Lari!

13:58.200 --> 14:00.160
Did you tell Massimo we were going out?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.040
Obviously… not!

14:04.760 --> 14:06.720
He doesn't tell me when he goes out.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.960
Fuck. Well, this is gonna be interesting!

14:10.480 --> 14:13.120
-Come on, really? This place?
-What's the big deal?

14:13.200 --> 14:16.240
All the good restaurants
in town belong to the Torricellis.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.160
Let's go.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.680
Now,
that's what I call a food baby.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.160
Well, just more to love.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.160
Hello?

16:40.680 --> 16:41.840
Who was that?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.880
- How was everything?
-Great. Thanks.

16:49.960 --> 16:50.840
Thank you.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.960
Tell me the truth.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.760
Olo, sometimes the truth is complicated.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.880
Lari, what happened on that island?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.800
-He was just different.
- Who?

17:23.880 --> 17:24.880
Nacho.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.760
I ran away with him
after Massimo cheated with Anna.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.840
Hold on. I thought
that was a plot against Massimo.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.200
It was,
but I didn't know it at the time.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.440
Nacho was like my… best friend.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.360
Seriously? You saw the guy twice,
and now he's your best friend?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.320
Whatever. I'm not here to lecture you.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.800
Sure sounds like it.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.560
Did you sleep with him?

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
No.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.240
But he was there for me
when my whole world was falling apart.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.240
He took care of me, and I felt free.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.240
Okay.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.600
I have to forget about him.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.680
Oh my God.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.360
You're in love with him.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.880
Don't be ridiculous. He's just some guy.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.440
Okay, come on.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.320
We're going dancing.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.880
Sorry, <i>maestro.</i>

33:59.040 --> 34:00.480
Rematch later?

34:04.160 --> 34:05.000
Yeah?

34:07.240 --> 34:09.120
What do you mean?

34:10.880 --> 34:11.880
What?

34:13.400 --> 34:15.080
And you're just telling me this now?

34:16.400 --> 34:18.440
No. Fix this today.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.760
I don't give a shit.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.560
Massimo, what's wrong?

34:30.320 --> 34:32.440
Giuseppe fucked up, as usual.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.600
I've known you my entire life.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.400
These kinds of things never get to you.

34:38.120 --> 34:41.040
Either you're getting old,
or something else is up.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.280
-Tommy.
-Yeah?

34:43.800 --> 34:45.040
I'm out.

35:28.960 --> 35:33.040
Hey!
Why the hell are you in such a hurry?

35:36.680 --> 35:40.240
My marriage is falling apart,
so I'm focusing on my career.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.360
Now, come on!

35:41.440 --> 35:46.080
That's great,
but do we really have to walk this much?

35:48.360 --> 35:49.960
I'm so over this.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.240
Check this out.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.520
- The first one.
-<i>It's great.</i>

36:56.200 --> 36:58.160
It has wide sleeves.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.040
Got it! What about this one?

37:04.880 --> 37:05.720
Hi!

37:05.800 --> 37:08.080
Hiya, Mama Klara!

37:08.840 --> 37:10.520
I'm getting married!

37:10.600 --> 37:13.040
- Okay, Mom…
-<i>Really? Congratulations!</i>

37:13.120 --> 37:14.800
-Like the dress?
-I'll call later.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.200
Beautiful!

37:16.280 --> 37:18.360
-My little…
-I'll call you. Bye. Love you.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.920
Kisses. Bye.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.920
-Bye!
-Bye!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.680
That was nice.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.920
The photographer
needs to be tall and handsome.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.800
Why? 'Cause I say so.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.560
Plus, if the photos are from below,
it'll look like we have double chins,

38:12.640 --> 38:13.920
which we don't want.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.800
Just like this. Click, click, click.

38:16.520 --> 38:20.040
Okay, fine. He can be short and handsome,
but he's gonna need a ladder.

38:20.120 --> 38:20.960
Olo!

38:21.040 --> 38:22.040
Thank you. <i>Grazie.</i>

38:26.600 --> 38:29.680
And then I'll plop my bare ass
right on the cake.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.840
Shit, you're not listening to me.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.040
I <i>am </i>listening.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.680
What kind of photographer do I want?

38:40.280 --> 38:42.040
One with his ass in the cake.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.040
You're unbelievable!

38:46.960 --> 38:48.040
I can't believe you!

39:07.120 --> 39:08.520
Massimo, let's go.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.800
I'll catch up with you later.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.760
- Morning.
- Ma'am!

41:59.840 --> 42:01.760
- Not now.
- Ma'am!

43:27.440 --> 43:30.000
Did you see the email?
Go on, read it!

43:32.800 --> 43:35.080
We're going to Portugal!

44:15.480 --> 44:16.440
I'm here.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.080
Sorry, I couldn't leave <i>amore mio</i>
with a hard-on.

44:20.160 --> 44:24.360
And now… what happens
in Lagos stays in Lagos!

45:13.240 --> 45:16.480
-They were in the villa the entire time?
-The whole day, why?

45:23.840 --> 45:25.640
He didn't even come to say goodbye?

45:29.120 --> 45:30.920
I don't think we can fix this.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.080
How much longer?

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
Nailed it.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.200
You're such a drunk.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.800
Are you trying
to fucking scare me to death?

46:41.880 --> 46:43.320
What are you wearing?

46:43.400 --> 46:45.520
You're going out drinking with me in this?

46:45.600 --> 46:47.600
Olo, I'm exhausted!

46:47.680 --> 46:50.080
We've got a big meeting tomorrow.
I want to rest.

46:50.160 --> 46:53.040
I can't believe you!

46:53.120 --> 46:58.200
-Weren't you the one talking about change?
-Watch me.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.120
-"I'm back from the dead!"
-Look at me. I'm lying down.

47:01.200 --> 47:04.760
-Wait, what was it you said?
- I'm beginning to live.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.560
What a poet.
Shame you don't practice what you preach.

47:07.640 --> 47:11.800
-Get up! I'm not sitting around all day!
-Ola, no!

47:11.880 --> 47:14.000
-You have one minute!
-You're crazy!

47:14.080 --> 47:16.960
-The clock is ticking! Sixty!
-Olo!

47:17.040 --> 47:21.680
-Fifty-nine, fifty-eight…
-Fifty-nine, fifty-eight…

47:52.400 --> 47:55.520
Hey,
the view's pretty good down here.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.920
-Olo?
-What?

48:01.920 --> 48:03.800
Aren't you engaged?

48:05.120 --> 48:06.440
I'm just looking.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.920
His board's nice too.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.320
Hey, cocktails.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.880
I don't get it.

48:50.440 --> 48:55.000
How can you be that into
messing up your hair in the waves?

48:55.080 --> 48:57.320
-There's something primal about it.
-What?

48:59.920 --> 49:01.400
It's just you and the water.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.160
What? You and the water?

49:03.240 --> 49:06.520
What are you, a surfing guru?
Have you ever even stood on a board?

49:06.600 --> 49:08.440
-Yeah.
-When?

49:08.520 --> 49:10.360
This one time.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.360
Except I spent most of my time
in the water.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.640
Why am I not surprised?

49:33.760 --> 49:34.920
What?

49:44.160 --> 49:45.400
Olo, we have to go.

49:45.480 --> 49:48.440
-Are you crazy? We just got here.
-We have to leave now.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.600
What's up with you?

49:51.080 --> 49:52.200
That's him.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.280
Who?

49:53.800 --> 49:55.680
-Nacho.
-What nachos?

49:55.760 --> 49:58.360
The guy who got me from the ball.
He can't see me.

49:59.800 --> 50:00.920
-Here he comes.
-What?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.560
-Walking towards us.
-Here?

50:02.640 --> 50:03.480
No.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.960
-Oh, wait, he is.
-Let's go.

50:08.040 --> 50:08.920
Shush.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.880
-He's with some chick.
-What chick?

50:11.960 --> 50:14.440
-Blonde. Cute. Nice legs…
-What?

50:14.960 --> 50:16.320
She's pretty hot.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.040
-That's his sister Amelia.
-You met his sister?

50:26.120 --> 50:28.280
-What about his mom? Grandma too?
-Stop it.

50:28.800 --> 50:32.560
-Olo, I have to get out of here.
-I'll shield you with my body.

50:35.920 --> 50:36.760
Go, now.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.720
Go, quick.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.840
I don't fucking believe it!

50:56.040 --> 50:59.760
Now tell me everything.
I want every little detail.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.400
Fuck…

55:17.560 --> 55:18.800
Over here!

55:18.880 --> 55:22.360
Where? Hey, Lari. Let's go to the bar.

55:37.400 --> 55:41.600
Well, Olo, that beer
goes really well with your dress.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.400
I've been classy for over an hour now.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.480
This is long overdue.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.640
So bougie!

56:10.280 --> 56:11.320
You coming?

56:51.280 --> 56:55.040
Let go of me, for fuck's sake!
What the hell is this?

57:56.200 --> 57:57.800
Let go of me!

58:08.720 --> 58:10.960
What? That rat!

58:11.960 --> 58:14.960
Mrs. Tortellini
can kiss my ass!

1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:10.680
Fuck me.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:12.560
Okay.

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:16.080
Some friend she is.

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:22.960
She's out there getting laid,
and she locks me away in a hotel room.

1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:26.600
Without a single drop of alcohol!

1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:30.360
She'll pay for this.

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:32.600
There we go. There we go.

1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:37.760
Fuck! No stairs.

1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:42.480
Help!

1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:58.680
Goddammit!

1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:48.600
Well played.

1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:51.120
You managed to lock this tiger in a cage.

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:56.480
Fucking hell.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.720
Have you completely lost
your fucking mind?

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:02.160
You've gone crazy
for some dick you hardly know

1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:04.440
just because he makes you wet?

1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:07.040
What now, Lari? Hmm?

1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:12.080
Well? Are you going to break up
your marriage and family for him?

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:13.560
I can't believe it.

1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:16.800
You haven't married Domenico yet,

1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:19.040
and you're already acting
like a Torricelli.

1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:22.600
Spare me the bullshit
about family loyalty.

1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:24.800
What am I supposed to do?

1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:28.880
Wait until Massimo deals with his shit
and remembers I'm his wife?

1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:35.120
Who are you looking out for?
Me or yourself?

1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:39.640
Just leave me alone.

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000
I have to figure out what I really want.

1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:52.080
You're right.

1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:02.680
I'm sorry I didn't ask how you're feeling,
or if you need anything.

1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:13.040
Lari, look at me.

1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:15.960
Look at me.

1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:21.800
I love you.

1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:27.400
I want you to be happy.

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:32.720
Whatever you decide,
I'll support you. You hear me?

1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:38.320
I'm just worried.

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:42.640
Come here.

1:22:55.240 --> 1:22:56.560
Watch out for my snot.

1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:01.320
Remember, just say the word,
and I'll fucking kill both of them.

1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:08.040
And I'll find you a nice, calm guy
from a village near Radom, okay?

1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:10.480
That's right.

1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:11.880
What?

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:15.080
You'll grow old and die of boredom.

1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:26.920
Honey?

1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.160
Hi, Dad.

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:31.560
Hi, sweetie!

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.600
I've missed riding with you.

1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:39.920
Jesus, Laura, did something happen?

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.480
You came here on a motorcycle?

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.800
You're gonna give me a heart attack.

1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:49.680
You know how much I hate your escapades.

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:51.560
Happy to see you too, Mom.

1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:56.160
Come in. I've got some pork chops.

1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:00.000
Of course, you never call ahead.

1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:04.880
You could have told me you were coming.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.760
I would have prepared.

1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:10.280
I always have to think on my feet.

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.760
Honey, what's going on?

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.920
What do you mean? Nothing's going on.
I'm just here to visit you.

1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:44.480
Your mom is convinced
that people buy motorcycles

1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:47.760
when they're going through
some kind of crisis.

1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:52.720
Honey, you'll be 30 soon.

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.000
If you were okay, you'd be spending
your birthday with your husband,

1:24:57.080 --> 1:24:59.800
celebrating the anniversary
of your first meeting.

1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.480
-As far as I know--
-I'm in love with someone else.

1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:14.640
His name is Nacho.

1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:18.920
Honey, get me a cigarette.

1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:23.560
But we agreed
that we wouldn't smoke anymore.

1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:25.960
Please, bring me a cigarette!

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:30.320
All right then.

1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:25.040
Honey, if you weren't married to Massimo,
who would you choose?

1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:29.880
The problem is, I don't know.

1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:34.000
When you have the answer,
you'll know what to do.

1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:39.040
All right…

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.400
I'll tell you
a little secret.

1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:03.360
I think it's what's kept
our marriage alive for 35 years.

1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:11.000
Remember, a woman
must be selfish in a relationship.

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:14.960
If you put your own happiness first,

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:18.080
you'll do whatever it takes
to make it last, right?

1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:20.840
You will cherish your relationship.

1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:25.440
But it can't be
a relationship that destroys you.

1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.160
Remember that a woman
who lives only for her man

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:35.440
will always be unhappy.

1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:38.080
Yeah.

1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:41.200
And her man will be unhappy too.

1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:21.200
Thanks.

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:23.000
Ah, my coffee.

1:30:23.080 --> 1:30:24.800
Okay. No lid for me.

1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:27.400
Thank you very much.

1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:29.920
Thanks. Bye.

1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:38.160
Coffee for Dad. And for his daughter?

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.480
-Lemonade.
-Lemonade.

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:49.880
Sometimes I wish
I was still that little girl

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:51.800
you used to take out for lemonade.

1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:55.320
You'll always be my little girl.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.880
I like spending time with you

1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:39.720
because I can eat as much as I want
and not feel guilty.

1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:40.640
Yeah.

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.200
It's different with Mom.

1:31:42.280 --> 1:31:43.680
-I've noticed.
-Hmm.

1:31:44.600 --> 1:31:47.640
There are two things
you never point out to a woman.

1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:48.560
What things?

1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:51.280
Her age and the amount of food she eats.

1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:53.680
I never knew about the second one.

1:31:53.760 --> 1:31:56.320
-You should.
-Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:01.600
Excuse me.

1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:07.280
-Just a second. Olga won't stop calling.
-Okay.

1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:20.640
How's everything?

1:32:20.720 --> 1:32:21.920
-Good, thanks.
- Great.

1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:46.520
Hello. Answer my calls,
or I'll have a heart attack.

1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:48.400
Jeez, Olo, relax. What's up?

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:50.200
<i>You want to know what's up?</i>

1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:54.520
Massimo knows about everything, Lari.
He knows about you and Nacho!

1:32:54.600 --> 1:32:56.960
He's gonna kill you,
me, and God knows who else!

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:58.600
Um, he told you that?

1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:02.600
No, I overheard him
talking to Domenico.

1:33:03.480 --> 1:33:07.080
Um, how did you know
what they were talking about?

1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:08.400
You don't speak Italian.

1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:09.960
<i>Maybe you don't.</i>

1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:13.400
But I was pissed off
about not understanding, so I learned.

1:33:13.480 --> 1:33:17.080
Maybe I'm not a fluent speaker,
but I understand everything.

1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:19.280
You know how to say, "Nacho fucked Laura"?

1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:25.280
I guess it's time to go back to Sicily.

1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:28.680
Are you fucking insane? He knows!

1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:30.680
Shoot! Fuck knows what he's gonna do!

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:32.960
<i>Fuck. I just said, "shoot."</i>

1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:36.720
I'd rather him shoot himself
than you or me.

1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:41.440
Olo, stop. There must be a reason
he hasn't done anything about it yet.

1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.680
Are you even listening to me?
Massimo won't forgive cheating.

1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:47.840
<i>-Listen.</i>
-Shit.

1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:51.520
I'm not scared of my own husband.
I won't hide from him.

1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:55.000
I'm coming back.

1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:02.120
Do what you want.
I'm working on… an escape plan.

1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:05.280
Olo, relax. Have a cigarette, okay?

1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:08.840
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
I can't stop smoking!

1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:11.400
Okay, bye.

1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:26.200
Dad, I have to go back to Sicily.

1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:27.720
Okay.

1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:33.240
But first, let's go back to the table.
I ordered some apple pie.

1:34:34.040 --> 1:34:35.080
Come on.

1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:51.320
You're here!

1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:58.240
Okay. I packed just one suitcase.

1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:01.040
I grabbed your stuff too.
It'll be a quick escape.

1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:03.280
Why the fuck didn't you call or text?

1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:05.320
I would've sent a driver for you.

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:08.280
My driver was really nice.

1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:12.200
Are you serious? Now's not the best time--

1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:13.280
Fuck.

1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:21.880
Are you fucking crazy?

1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:31.800
Have you forgotten your husband's
line of work?

1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:34.120
Why don't you bring him with you,

1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:37.560
and I'll look up how to send
a dead body back to Poland?

1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:54.440
God, it's so sad.
You're going to die on your birthday.

1:41:55.440 --> 1:41:57.200
Happy birthday, Lari!

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:01.440
If you survive,
I bought you a really nice bag.

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:03.200
If something happens, I'll keep it.

1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:04.840
-Olo…
-Yeah?

1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:05.880
Where's Massimo?

1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:10.960
He went to the beach.

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:16.000
-Okay, I'll go find him.
-Really?

1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:18.360
We need to work things out.

1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:24.280
And when I get back,
we'll drink to my resurrection, okay?

1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:28.240
-I have to go now.
-Yeah.

1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:32.960
-Olo…
-Yeah?

1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:37.480
-I'm doing this alone.
-Oh yeah, alone. I'll stay here and wait.

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:46.400
Fuck…

1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:02.120
I'll just sit and wait.

1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:06.600
Lari will be okay on her own.

1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:23.480
