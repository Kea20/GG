353
00:18:08.556 --> 00:18:10.257
I'll show you
where you'll be sleeping.

354
00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:17.230
To your left.

355
00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.109
Make yourself comfortable.

356
00:18:40.822 --> 00:18:42.255
Here's a towel.

357
00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:45.325
Cool.

358
00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:48.663
I know it ain't much...

359
00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:50.598
but it'll do.

360
00:18:51.766 --> 00:18:53.233
Let me know
when you get settled.

361
00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:54.368
I'll show you around.

362
00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:04.612
You hungry?

363
00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:06.313
I'm good.

364
00:19:10.685 --> 00:19:12.845
Thought you said in your letter
you don't have a phone.

365
00:19:14.454 --> 00:19:15.454
I don't.

366
00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:18.392
That one's hooked
directly to the shed.

367
00:19:19.694 --> 00:19:21.395
Jean used to use it
to let me know

368
00:19:21.428 --> 00:19:22.797
when supper was ready.

369
00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:31.349
I'm just going to point out
the elephant in the room.

370
00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:35.777
Why is this house empty?

371
00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:40.280
I decided to downsize
after Jean died.

372
00:19:41.749 --> 00:19:43.651
I don't like clutter.

373
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:45.953
I mean, there has
to be a limit to...

374
00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:49.524
- You like the <i>Twilight Zone?</i>
- Like the show?

375
00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:52.627
My uncle was a set decorator
on the <i>Twilight Zone.</i>

376
00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:55.830
He gave me this
when I was much younger.

377
00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.966
It was prop in a famous episode.

378
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.601
What episode?

379
00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:02.537
Does that matter?

380
00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:05.573
I just thought
it was interesting.

381
00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:08.776
Cool.

382
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.812
Let's get going, shall we?

383
00:20:13.346 --> 00:20:16.249
Ah, don't touch that switch.

384
00:20:16.283 --> 00:20:17.384
You got it?

385
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.921
Okay.

386
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.894
[sighs]

387
00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:28.896
[Don] Two things
we need to get straight.

388
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.231
First, no cell phones.

389
00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:33.266
Why?

390
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.220
I don't want you knowing
my location, that's why.

391
00:20:35.536 --> 00:20:36.938
I don't get service out here.

392
00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:38.506
[grumbles]

393
00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:39.750
This is stupid,
I couldn't get maps out...

394
00:20:39.774 --> 00:20:41.054
- The quicker that you...
- Fine.

395
00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:43.711
I'll give it
back to you before you leave.

396
00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:45.479
I assume
you planned on giving it back.

397
00:20:45.513 --> 00:20:46.948
The second thing
you need to know

398
00:20:46.981 --> 00:20:49.617
is that this entire place...

399
00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:52.319
is booby trapped.

400
00:20:52.687 --> 00:20:54.555
So, now you got the basics.

401
00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:56.657
Hold on, booby trapped?

402
00:20:59.093 --> 00:21:00.595
Like, homemade bombs and shit?

403
00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:02.797
Some of 'em, yes.

404
00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:05.967
Are you telling me this...

405
00:21:06.634 --> 00:21:08.401
This place contains

406
00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:11.706
random things that could
kill me?

407
00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:14.499
How is that the second most
important thing to tell me?

408
00:21:15.076 --> 00:21:16.911
Just don't flip
that switch inside,

409
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.345
and you'll be fine.

410
00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:20.548
Keep in mind that if it is red,

411
00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:21.983
you could be dead.

412
00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:24.552
Just stay with me.

413
00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:26.821
You'll be fine.
Oh, and here.

414
00:21:27.387 --> 00:21:29.389
If the shit hits the fan,

415
00:21:29.422 --> 00:21:30.725
I wrote up a set of guidelines

416
00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:31.826
for you to follow.

417
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.895
- Follow?
- Yeah.

418
00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:37.297
So, you don't get
blown up and shit.

419
00:21:37.832 --> 00:21:39.801
D... don't worry about it.

420
00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:41.401
I'll show you
where most of them are.

421
00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:44.471
The ones I remember anyway.

422
00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:46.473
There are ones you forgot about?

423
00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:50.044
Ugh, damn stray cats
keep knocking my shit over.

424
00:21:56.117 --> 00:21:57.985
[Don grumbling]

425
00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:10.798
[chime sounding]

426
00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:14.936
This is where I build
all my traps.

427
00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:16.904
Can you elaborate on the traps?

428
00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:18.806
Elaborate how?

429
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.409
I don't know.
Why are there traps?

430
00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:25.646
There's a giant beast
that lives in the woods.

431
00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:28.481
My plan is
to lure it to my house,

432
00:22:28.516 --> 00:22:30.084
trap it and kill it.

433
00:22:36.057 --> 00:22:37.390
[Don grunting]

434
00:22:37.424 --> 00:22:38.726
Is this a trap?

435
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.896
No.
Why would you think that?

436
00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:43.040
I don't know,
I mean... It looks...

437
00:22:43.064 --> 00:22:44.364
What is wrong with you?

438
00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:56.811
[Don mumbling absentmindedly]

439
00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:03.818
[mysterious music]

440
00:23:11.458 --> 00:23:12.827
You know,

441
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.729
for a guy
who doesn't like clutter,

442
00:23:14.762 --> 00:23:16.429
this place says differently.

443
00:23:16.463 --> 00:23:18.766
One thing you'll find out
about me, Allen,

444
00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:21.969
everything I have around me
at any particular moment

445
00:23:22.003 --> 00:23:25.472
is there
for a very specific purpose.

446
00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:29.710
[sparks crackling]

447
00:23:29.744 --> 00:23:31.212
So, Don,

448
00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:32.880
you promised in your letter

449
00:23:32.914 --> 00:23:34.615
I was going to see

450
00:23:34.649 --> 00:23:36.416
the monster you were hunting.

451
00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:38.886
Well, yeah...

452
00:23:40.855 --> 00:23:42.455
I ain't no artist.

453
00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:45.526
But I sketched this...

454
00:23:46.493 --> 00:23:48.596
the last time I saw

455
00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:49.897
Eye.

456
00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:53.968
- Eye?
- That's what I call her.

457
00:23:58.506 --> 00:24:00.074
[sighs]

458
00:24:01.709 --> 00:24:03.711
I remember
the first time I saw her.

459
00:24:04.612 --> 00:24:05.713
She was...

460
00:24:06.714 --> 00:24:08.082
beautiful...

461
00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:11.052
in some way I...

462
00:24:11.953 --> 00:24:13.821
can't really describe.

463
00:24:15.756 --> 00:24:19.226
[screaming]

464
00:24:21.696 --> 00:24:23.898
I can't wait to kill her.

465
00:24:35.576 --> 00:24:37.044
Man,

466
00:24:37.078 --> 00:24:38.913
I think it's funny
you wrote your letter to me

467
00:24:38.946 --> 00:24:40.081
on a greeting card.

468
00:24:40.982 --> 00:24:42.183
Why is that funny?

469
00:24:45.252 --> 00:24:47.121
You're an interesting guy,
Don, but...

470
00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:48.856
[coughs]

471
00:24:48.889 --> 00:24:50.667
...I don't take you
for the greeting card type.

472
00:24:50.691 --> 00:24:51.759
They were Jean's.

473
00:24:52.994 --> 00:24:54.762
She had
a bunch of 'em left over.

474
00:24:55.262 --> 00:24:57.098
She was
the kind of person that cared

475
00:24:57.131 --> 00:24:58.766
when nobody else did.

476
00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:01.802
I'm just trying
to get rid of them.

477
00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.245
Huh.

478
00:25:13.247 --> 00:25:15.683
Everybody needs a plan B.

479
00:25:16.217 --> 00:25:18.753
That thing doesn't look like
it's been fired in years.

480
00:25:18.786 --> 00:25:19.820
Trust me.

481
00:25:20.254 --> 00:25:21.589
She's old,

482
00:25:21.622 --> 00:25:23.057
but she'll still
get the job done.

483
00:25:24.692 --> 00:25:27.161
Oh, hey, before I forget.

484
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.898
[Don grunting]

485
00:25:35.169 --> 00:25:36.270
What is it?

486
00:25:37.004 --> 00:25:39.707
No, no.
What is it?

487
00:25:40.274 --> 00:25:41.742
It's bait.

488
00:25:43.944 --> 00:25:45.746
It's got a bell
on the other end.

489
00:25:47.248 --> 00:25:49.550
There's two kinds of people
in this world, Allen.

490
00:25:49.984 --> 00:25:52.887
Those that wait
and those that can't anymore.

491
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.655
[Don grunting]

492
00:25:54.688 --> 00:25:56.690
This beast took my cattle,

493
00:25:56.724 --> 00:25:59.593
I am done
waiting on this fucker.

494
00:26:02.063 --> 00:26:04.065
Monster took my livestock,

495
00:26:04.098 --> 00:26:05.900
cancer took my wife.

496
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:08.736
[grunting]

497
00:26:08.769 --> 00:26:10.171
You do the math,

498
00:26:10.204 --> 00:26:12.006
I've got nothing left to lose.

499
00:26:13.774 --> 00:26:15.109
- [Don grunts]
- What is that?

500
00:26:16.877 --> 00:26:19.113
It is time to do
some monster huntin'.

501
00:26:20.314 --> 00:26:21.582
Monster hunting?

502
00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:23.117
What does that entail?

503
00:26:42.403 --> 00:26:44.705
This thing starts beeping,

504
00:26:44.738 --> 00:26:45.973
you just follow me?

505
00:26:47.374 --> 00:26:49.043
Follow you?

506
00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:50.916
What would you be doing
if that starts beeping?

507
00:26:51.412 --> 00:26:53.614
Running like hell
back to the house.

508
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.825
So I saw you had a horse.

509
00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:05.926
Do you ride?

510
00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:14.168
My family had horses
in Agoura Hills growing up.

511
00:27:15.202 --> 00:27:16.303
Horse ain't mine.

512
00:27:17.338 --> 00:27:20.274
It just showed up one day
and wouldn't leave.

513
00:27:21.108 --> 00:27:23.144
I decided
to build a fence around it

514
00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:24.879
so it wouldn't get hit
by a car or truck.

515
00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:27.381
I don't give
two shits about that horse.

516
00:27:27.982 --> 00:27:29.049
Gotcha.

517
00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:41.962
So what's the plan here, Don?

518
00:27:41.996 --> 00:27:43.006
- 'Cause right now...
- You know what, Allen?

519
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.431
You talk too much.

520
00:27:45.132 --> 00:27:46.834
Let's try not for a while.

521
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:50.437
You do realize I'm interviewing
you for a podcast, right?

522
00:27:50.471 --> 00:27:53.174
I don't care how you choose
to tell the story.

523
00:27:55.176 --> 00:27:58.812
[birds chirping]

524
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:03.951

525
00:28:11.892 --> 00:28:12.960
[grunts]

526
00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:19.967
No luck today.

527
00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:23.103
I'm going to bed.

528
00:28:23.137 --> 00:28:24.205
What?

529
00:28:24.238 --> 00:28:25.306
[Don grunts]

[Allen sighing]

531
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.361
I'm here now...

532
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:49.830
on the farm.

533
00:28:51.065 --> 00:28:52.132

This doesn't have
to be a battle.

716
00:40:53.988 --> 00:40:55.222
You're right, Allen.

717
00:40:55.256 --> 00:40:56.557
It doesn't.

718
00:40:57.792 --> 00:40:59.226
All those sensors,

719
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.963
they're also voice activated.

720
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:05.066
- Don.
- [Don chuckling]

721
00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:06.567
Stop this.

722
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:11.939
[Don chuckling]

723
00:41:15.242 --> 00:41:16.844
[Don groaning]

724
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:28.923
So here I am.

725
00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:33.627
Listen.

726
00:41:33.661 --> 00:41:35.196
You got something I want.

727
00:41:35.229 --> 00:41:36.964
It's that simple,

728
00:41:36.998 --> 00:41:39.600
and you are not leaving here
till you hand it over.

729
00:41:39.633 --> 00:41:41.035
Don!
This is stupid.

730
00:41:41.068 --> 00:41:42.670
We have no clue
who these people are.

731
00:41:42.703 --> 00:41:44.171
[man]
<i>How much do you know?</i>

732
00:41:50.177 --> 00:41:51.278
[walkie bleeping]

733
00:41:51.312 --> 00:41:52.880
I know this much,

734
00:41:52.913 --> 00:41:55.916
you're trespassing
on my property

735
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.185
and you are
in possession of something

736
00:41:58.219 --> 00:42:00.821
that I have been trying
to trap for some time.

737
00:42:00.855 --> 00:42:02.256
[man]
<i>Is that all?</i>

738
00:42:02.289 --> 00:42:04.191
I also know
that you are not leaving here

739
00:42:04.225 --> 00:42:06.961
without handing it over,
and that's for damn sure.

740
00:42:06.994 --> 00:42:08.829
Don!

741
00:42:08.863 --> 00:42:10.743
[man] <i>Is that a threat</i>
<i>I'm hearing in your tone?</i>

742
00:42:11.165 --> 00:42:12.767
[Don laughing]

743
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.970
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm not carrying a gun.

744
00:42:16.704 --> 00:42:18.939
Now, shouldn't you
be more worried?

745
00:42:18.973 --> 00:42:20.641
I don't know,

746
00:42:20.674 --> 00:42:22.977
maybe the thing
that I'm threatening you with

747
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.279
was meant to stop something
much bigger than you?

748
00:42:27.615 --> 00:42:30.918
[suspenseful music]

749
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:32.253
Showtime front!

750
00:42:33.287 --> 00:42:34.588
Showtime front!

751
00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:36.057
Show... God!

752
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.925
Shit!
Shit!

753
00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:39.693
Showtime front!

754
00:42:39.727 --> 00:42:41.195
[suspenseful music]

755
00:42:41.228 --> 00:42:42.696
Hey!

756
00:42:52.673 --> 00:42:53.774
[Don yells]

757
00:43:04.185 --> 00:43:05.286
I think...

758
00:43:07.354 --> 00:43:10.791
I think it just might be
best if I go home now.

759
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:31.278
[loud thumping]

760
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.249
[Allen]
<i>I've met some unique</i>

761
00:45:15.282 --> 00:45:18.719
<i>and odd people doing this show.</i>

762
00:45:20.854 --> 00:45:22.289
<i>But Don takes the cake.</i>

763
00:45:24.491 --> 00:45:26.093
<i>He really is the craziest person</i>

764
00:45:26.126 --> 00:45:27.294
<i>I've ever met.</i>

765
00:45:39.907 --> 00:45:41.552
There's no way any of you
are going to believe me

766
00:45:41.576 --> 00:45:43.336
when I tell you
what I saw today. [chuckling]

767
00:45:45.547 --> 00:45:47.547
It's like something
out of a science fiction movie.

768
00:45:50.084 --> 00:45:51.785
There were these masked people,

769
00:45:53.087 --> 00:45:55.122
almost like they work
in Area 51 or something,

770
00:45:58.158 --> 00:45:59.158
and they were...

771
00:46:01.462 --> 00:46:03.022
well, I don't know
what they were doing.

772
00:46:05.266 --> 00:46:08.135
The truth is, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

773
00:46:13.974 --> 00:46:15.442
<i>I can't
tell what's a bigger mystery.</i>

774
00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:20.548
<i>If the monster
is actually real...</i>

775
00:46:26.053 --> 00:46:27.187
<i>or if Don...</i>

776
00:46:28.556 --> 00:46:29.823
<i>is...</i>

777
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.568
I just can't read Don.

778
00:46:45.372 --> 00:46:47.975
I keep trying to find
meaning within Don's story,

779
00:46:48.409 --> 00:46:49.577
but I just... I can't.

780
00:46:52.279 --> 00:46:53.480
Maybe there's no meaning.

781
00:47:00.921 --> 00:47:02.022
Maybe this whole thing...

782
00:47:04.391 --> 00:47:05.459
is crazy...

783
00:47:06.528 --> 00:47:07.595
random.

784
00:47:10.931 --> 00:47:11.999
And nothing else.

785
00:47:19.541 --> 00:47:20.608
As far as...

786
00:47:22.577 --> 00:47:24.144
do I think the monster is real?

787
00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:30.417
The answer is no.

788
00:47:35.623 --> 00:47:36.957
I think in stories...

789
00:47:38.926 --> 00:47:40.446
there's always more
than meets the eye.

790
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.068
<i>In this case...</i>

791
00:47:52.106 --> 00:47:53.386
<i>there's nothing more
to see here.</i>

792
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.467
[Allen] You good, Don?

793
00:48:25.339 --> 00:48:27.441
I'm good. [clearing throat]

794
00:48:27.474 --> 00:48:29.009
Wonderful.

795
00:48:30.444 --> 00:48:31.912
Never been better.

796
00:48:46.427 --> 00:48:47.629
Don?

797
00:48:47.662 --> 00:48:49.229
[Don] Let it be, Al.

798
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:51.165
Just let it be.

799
00:48:51.633 --> 00:48:53.300
Everything was for nothing.

800
00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:54.569
Did great.

801
00:48:54.602 --> 00:48:55.670
Do you want to talk?

802
00:49:00.642 --> 00:49:02.476
Don, do you want to talk?

803
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:06.681
[Don] What I would like
is for you to shut the fuck up.

804
00:49:25.733 --> 00:49:28.603
I... struggle...

805
00:49:29.403 --> 00:49:31.338
with staying in the moment.

806
00:49:34.576 --> 00:49:36.143
Jean would remind me.

807
00:49:36.511 --> 00:49:38.378
She'd say, "Come back."

808
00:49:39.313 --> 00:49:40.715
When she saw me daydreaming.

809
00:49:43.217 --> 00:49:45.687
She'd keep me grounded
when I'd wander.

810
00:49:49.223 --> 00:49:51.726
When she died, everything that...

811
00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.698
That... that kept me
grounded was gone.

812
00:49:56.731 --> 00:49:58.700
It didn't matter
what things I had anymore.

813
00:49:58.733 --> 00:50:00.000
I couldn't...

814
00:50:00.702 --> 00:50:03.303
Oh, God.
There I go again, I...

815
00:50:03.337 --> 00:50:05.272
I lost track
of where I was going.

816
00:50:06.774 --> 00:50:08.141
I can tell you this, though.

817
00:50:09.176 --> 00:50:11.044
The things that hurt the worst

818
00:50:11.078 --> 00:50:12.614
are the ones
that you don't see coming.

819
00:50:15.617 --> 00:50:17.561
- [Allen] I would like to add...
- No, I know... I know...

820
00:50:17.585 --> 00:50:20.053
I know what I was going to say.

821
00:50:20.087 --> 00:50:21.221
The boxes.

822
00:50:22.155 --> 00:50:24.191
When Jean got sick,

823
00:50:24.224 --> 00:50:26.460
she decided
to leave me these things

824
00:50:26.493 --> 00:50:29.296
for me to find,
long after she left.

825
00:50:32.199 --> 00:50:33.701
And I put 'em in these boxes.

826
00:50:37.672 --> 00:50:38.740
And they'd...

827
00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:42.142
bring me back to reality
when I'd wander,

828
00:50:42.175 --> 00:50:43.277
which I often do.

829
00:50:47.381 --> 00:50:48.550
Jean told me, she'd...

830
00:50:50.585 --> 00:50:53.253
She left me 52 things.

831
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:56.591
One for each year
we were together.

832
00:50:58.693 --> 00:51:01.663
I still haven't found
number 52. [laughs]

833
00:51:03.698 --> 00:51:05.767
I see these boxes
scattered around,

834
00:51:07.735 --> 00:51:09.236
and it's... it's kind of like

835
00:51:09.269 --> 00:51:10.605
Jean is watching me.

836
00:51:13.508 --> 00:51:14.809
Does that make me weird?

837
00:51:19.346 --> 00:51:20.891
You're weird,
but that's not the reason.

838
00:51:20.915 --> 00:51:22.650
[Don laughing softly & sniffing]

839
00:51:24.552 --> 00:51:26.286
In fact, that's probably

840
00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.280
the most normal thing
you've said since I met you.

841
00:51:28.723 --> 00:51:30.123
Well, [sniffing]

842
00:51:31.258 --> 00:51:32.727
Where do you think number 52 is?

843
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:39.767
Honestly, Allen,
I don't think there is a 52.

844
00:51:41.936 --> 00:51:43.605
Jean's sense of humor.

845
00:51:46.206 --> 00:51:47.374
[exhaling hard]

846
00:51:50.945 --> 00:51:52.212
Are you good now, Don?

847
00:51:54.414 --> 00:51:55.550
Yeah, I'm good.

848
00:51:59.286 --> 00:52:01.388
Tomorrow I'll take you
back to your car.

849
00:52:03.223 --> 00:52:04.291
Sounds good.

850
00:52:06.527 --> 00:52:07.595
[metal box clanking]

851
00:52:18.573 --> 00:52:19.874
I never did tell
you why I wanted

852
00:52:19.907 --> 00:52:22.275
to kill Eye so bad, did I?

853
00:52:23.611 --> 00:52:26.313
You said it was
because she ate your cattle.

854
00:52:26.346 --> 00:52:27.649
[laughing] No.

855
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:30.183
I was going to get
rid of the cattle

856
00:52:30.217 --> 00:52:31.519
and move away from here anyway.

857
00:52:34.221 --> 00:52:36.423
Then why did you want to become
a monster hunter so bad?

858
00:52:37.457 --> 00:52:38.526
Monster hunter...

859
00:52:40.327 --> 00:52:42.697
never thought of myself
that way, but I'll take it.

860
00:52:44.297 --> 00:52:47.635
No, the reason that I wanted
to kill Eye so bad...

861
00:52:50.738 --> 00:52:51.806
Shit.

862
00:52:53.273 --> 00:52:54.553
Has that been on the whole time?

863
00:52:56.878 --> 00:52:59.446

I'm currently trapped

I think Don broke something
when he got mad.

So you don't get
blown up and shit.

924
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:08.089
The note says, number one,
"Avoid every fridge."

I'm terrified.
