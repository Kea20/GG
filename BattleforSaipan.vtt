[sad music]

6
00:01:34.413 --> 00:01:35.581
[Porter] So it will be

7
00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:37.541
with the resurrection
of the dead.


8
00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:42.463
The body that is sown
is perishable,


9
00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:45.174
rises imperishable.

10
00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:48.219
It is sown weak.

11
00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:50.554
It is risen with power.

12
00:01:51.472 --> 00:01:55.810
It is sown in dishonor.
It is risen with glory.


13
00:01:56.727 --> 00:02:01.190
It is sown as a natural body,
it is risen as a spiritual.


14
00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:05.111
If there is a natural body,
there is a spiritual body.


15
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:08.489
[Major Porter] That's
why I love you, major.


16
00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:09.448
Five clicks north,

17
00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:11.283
we should find a second
division hospital.


18
00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:14.411
Heads up, they hydrated.
We ain't in London no more.


19
00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:16.372
We got trees here,
so watch your six.


20
00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:18.124
- Copy that.
- Yes, Sir.


21
00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:19.625
No more tea time, huh, Major?

22
00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:21.544
No more tea time, Private.

23
00:02:21.627 --> 00:02:25.047
Just remember this is
a quick sweep.


24
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:26.006
Five, six days,

25
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.425
You could be home having
grits with grandma, girls.


26
00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.220
Oh, my granny makes
the best grits in all of Texas.


27
00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.513
Well, you go ahead and tell Nana

28
00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:34.140
she got a new grandson
named Gustavo,


29
00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:35.266
and I want some of them grits.

30
00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.101
I wouldn't care much for
your grandma's grits,


31
00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:38.644
but I'd love to meet
your sister.


32
00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.730
Hey, sonny boy, you too
young for that,


33
00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:44.233
but maybe when you're older,
young gun.

37
00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:01.977

[gun fires]

43
00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:13.340
You're a cold-blooded killer,
Sir.


44
00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:16.719
Let me look. You've been
long-bladed, soldier.


45
00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:18.262
Keep some pressure on that,
okay?


46
00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:20.097
- All right, okay.
- Pressure.


47
00:05:20.222 --> 00:05:21.724
All right. Let's see
what I've got.


48
00:05:21.807 --> 00:05:25.644
Hey, you make sure you call
my mom. She's gonna be mad.


49
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.189
She's gonna be real mad.

50
00:05:30.107 --> 00:05:31.942
Private Shaw, listen to me.

51
00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:33.527
- Yes.
- We gotta move, gotta go quietly.


52
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:34.653
- Can you make it?
- Yes, sir.


53
00:05:34.737 --> 00:05:35.821
Up we go. On your feet.

54
00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.114

Vic. Hey, you get any rest?

70
00:09:09.785 --> 00:09:10.661
Nah.

71
00:09:10.744 --> 00:09:11.829
You look like shit.

72
00:09:12.246 --> 00:09:13.205
Thanks.

73
00:09:14.123 --> 00:09:16.333
Could try and get you some
diphenhydramine if you'd like.


74
00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:17.501
I used to use
it to get to sleep

75
00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:19.003
when my mother-in-law visited.

76
00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:20.838
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.


77
00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:23.632
Something else?

78
00:09:24.008 --> 00:09:25.509
Saw something else in a crate.

79
00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:27.511
Not sure it was supposed
to be in the supply boat


80
00:09:27.678 --> 00:09:28.971
- Yeah, what?
- Bourbon.


81
00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:32.266
No, no, no. I need to
keep my head clear.


82
00:09:32.391 --> 00:09:34.852
Probably better. There's
no diphen out here anyway.


83
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:37.188
I hear we're both up
for double shifts today.


84
00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:39.607
No, no. I heard we got
new personnel


85
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.900
coming in from Hawaii.

86
00:09:41.275 --> 00:09:42.610
That's what I heard too.

87
00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:44.195
Looks like that's not
happening anymore.


88
00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:46.572
- This is bullshit.
- Talk to your friend.


89
00:09:47.907 --> 00:09:48.991
Maybe I will.

00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:58.876
[knocking]

91
00:09:59.668 --> 00:10:01.170
[Jake] Password.

92
00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:03.464
Come on, Jake, it's me

93
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:06.091
Good luck, Vic. General's
in a bad mood.


94
00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:09.136
- Isn't he always?
- It's worse.


95
00:10:10.638 --> 00:10:12.389
- Worse?
- Just a warning.


96
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:14.975
Thanks for the tip.

97
00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:16.936

[music on radio]

99
00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:19.271
Password?

100
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:24.110
I haven't slept for days.

101
00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:26.487
How am I supposed to remember
what the password is?


102
00:10:26.862 --> 00:10:28.239
That's close enough.

103
00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:36.372
Oh wow.

104
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.377
Now this makes me homesick.

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:47.508
Keeps a little
normalcy in my life


106
00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:49.343
In the middle of all
this insanity


107
00:10:56.517 --> 00:10:57.518
Smoke?

108
00:10:58.144 --> 00:10:59.437
Thanks. I quit.

109
00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:01.897
It helps me with my headaches.

110
00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:04.942
I think that's what
they call addiction.


111
00:11:06.068 --> 00:11:07.236
What do they call this.

112
00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:09.905
Bonus?

113
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.491
I'll drink to that.

114
00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:17.204
What can I help you with, Vic?

115
00:11:19.874 --> 00:11:21.542
I just heard that
we're not getting


116
00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:24.295
- new surgeons shipped in.
- I heard the same.


117
00:11:26.255 --> 00:11:29.675
That's a mistake.
We're being overrun in here.


118
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:32.636
What do you want me
to do about it?


119
00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:34.763
Plead our case.

120
00:11:34.847 --> 00:11:35.848
They're not gonna listen to me.

121
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:38.309
They put me out here so they don't
have to listen to me anymore.


122
00:11:40.102 --> 00:11:41.771
We're a week late on
the morphine.


123
00:11:43.314 --> 00:11:44.565
Troops are our priority.

124
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.696
Yeah, I, I'm not
getting any sleep.


125
00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:52.323
I'm not the only one.

126
00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:55.409
Everyone's pulling six shifts
without a break.


127
00:11:56.368 --> 00:11:57.828
It's been over a month, Jake.

128
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.291
How's your hand? 
Still shaking?

129
00:12:04.168 --> 00:12:05.169
Not at the moment.

130
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.214
Well, you keep up this schedule,
don't get enough sleep,


131
00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:11.300
it's gonna get worse and you're
not gonna be any good to us


132
00:12:11.383 --> 00:12:12.718
as a surgeon,
let alone a soldier,


133
00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:14.053
if you have to pick up a weapon.

134
00:12:16.764 --> 00:12:18.641
Luckily, as a surgeon,
we don't have to


135
00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:20.226
arm ourselves during battle.

136
00:12:24.939 --> 00:12:25.940
Vic,

137
00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:28.400
I'll do what I can.

138
00:12:29.693 --> 00:12:30.820
- Thanks, Jake.
- Yeah.


139
00:12:34.073 --> 00:12:35.825
You really should start
easing up on that.


140
00:12:37.368 --> 00:12:39.620
I'm getting ready
so I can toast to Jesus


141
00:12:39.703 --> 00:12:40.746
when my time comes.

142
00:12:41.914 --> 00:12:43.249
Isn't that supposed to be
with wine?


143
00:12:43.791 --> 00:12:45.042
[he chuckles]

144
00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:46.085
Who's keeping track?

145
00:12:47.878 --> 00:12:48.796
Vic,

146
00:12:52.925 --> 00:12:53.926
You'll be home soon.

147
00:13:02.393 --> 00:13:03.727
I wish I could say the same.

148
00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:11.986

[panicked voices]

150
00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:18.159
Secure the patient!
Prepare for surgery.


151
00:13:18.742 --> 00:13:21.120
Roll him in. Prepare
for surgery.


152
00:13:21.245 --> 00:13:22.621
Secure the patient,
secure the patient.


153
00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:24.748
Hold his legs down. Stay still,
Kid.


154
00:13:24.832 --> 00:13:26.125
[nurse shouts]

155
00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:30.921
Oh my god! Oh my god!
My arm! I'm gonna lose my arm!


156
00:13:31.755 --> 00:13:34.842
Just breathe! Stay with me,
stay with me.


157
00:13:34.967 --> 00:13:36.760
I'm gonna lose my arm,
I'm gonna lose my arm!


158
00:13:36.844 --> 00:13:39.138
You're gonna be fine,
you're gonna be fine!


159
00:13:39.388 --> 00:13:40.389
The bastard jumped at me!

160
00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:41.348
What have you got here?

161
00:13:41.432 --> 00:13:43.225
Chopper to his forearm,
ripped it up pretty bad.


162
00:13:43.976 --> 00:13:46.020
Given him more than enough morphine
but he ain't taking to it


163
00:13:46.103 --> 00:13:48.063
- The arm?
- It's hanging on by a thread.


164
00:13:48.147 --> 00:13:49.398
Needs to be amputated.

165
00:13:49.482 --> 00:13:52.193
- What's your name, Buster?
- Adell.


166
00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:54.779
Adell, is that your
first or last name?


167
00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:56.781
First. Last name's Dollins.

168
00:13:56.864 --> 00:13:59.241
Dollins? Where you from?

169
00:13:59.575 --> 00:14:00.701
Paris, Texas.

170
00:14:01.702 --> 00:14:03.871
I got a cousin from
Greensville. You ever been?


171
00:14:04.705 --> 00:14:05.706
Yeah.

172
00:14:05.873 --> 00:14:07.374
Hold him down. 
Secure the legs.

173
00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:09.251
They've got a great
burger joint.


174
00:14:10.836 --> 00:14:11.796
Am I right?

175
00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:14.465
- Yeah, they do.
- Yeah they do, they do, they do.


176
00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:17.718
And those Texas girls?

177
00:14:17.802 --> 00:14:19.345
I mean, the Southern
belle is awesome.


178
00:14:20.054 --> 00:14:21.430
Mine's from Tennessee,
but you know,


179
00:14:21.514 --> 00:14:23.390
you gotta get one of those,
right?


180
00:14:23.474 --> 00:14:24.475
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.394
Southern girls down there. Huh?
Beautiful.


182
00:14:28.938 --> 00:14:30.731
You did good kid, you did good.

183
00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:32.650
You're okay. It's okay.

184
00:14:33.734 --> 00:14:35.861
No, no, no. You're okay.
You're fine. Don't look.


185
00:14:36.112 --> 00:14:38.155
My arm! My arm!

186
00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:40.407
- My arm!
- Get in, get in. Get back in.


187
00:14:40.491 --> 00:14:41.992
Oh my god, what am I
gonna do with one arm?


188
00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:45.871
Right, get him in a room
and get someone


189
00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:47.540
to write a letter back
home for him, all right?


190
00:14:47.748 --> 00:14:49.792
Guys, that's you too. Let's go.

191
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:52.336
All right. Let's cut a rug,
sugar.


192
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.132
There we go, people.
There we go. Keep it moving.


193
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.180
[airplanes roar past]

194
00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:20.906
[loud explosions]

195
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:26.871
God!

196
00:16:05.034 --> 00:16:07.244
[men shouting]

197
00:16:07.411 --> 00:16:10.039
[anxious music]

198
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.433
Private.

199
00:16:29.642 --> 00:16:32.019
Up you get. Up you get, soldier.

200
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.903
[quiet music]

201
00:16:56.043 --> 00:16:57.837
Come on, come on, come on!

202
00:16:59.588 --> 00:17:01.549
Camilla, he needs to get
to surgery, now.


203
00:17:01.631 --> 00:17:03.259
We got a gaping
puncture wound here.


204
00:17:03.342 --> 00:17:05.261
Probably a bayonet,
massive bleeding.


205
00:17:05.343 --> 00:17:07.263
What, you and your friend
would like to be alive?


206
00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:09.723
You think? Made you
bored at Staten island.


207
00:17:09.807 --> 00:17:11.600
Gustavo was proceeding
on Los Angeles.


208
00:17:12.142 --> 00:17:16.147
McWeber, Brooklyn.
Go, go, go, go!


209
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:20.151
[percussive hit]

210
00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:29.201
- Good work.
- Thank you.


211
00:17:29.702 --> 00:17:31.704
Give him some of
my grandfather's vodka.


212
00:17:32.288 --> 00:17:34.123
You smuggling in booze,
young lady?


213
00:17:35.124 --> 00:17:37.209
You haven't had this vodka yet,
have you?


214
00:17:37.585 --> 00:17:38.544
No.

215
00:17:41.297 --> 00:17:42.465
Oh, sorry.

216
00:17:42.798 --> 00:17:44.300
You didn't wake me.

217
00:17:44.675 --> 00:17:47.052
I can't sleep on this god
forsaken island.


218
00:17:47.178 --> 00:17:48.387
Hey, do me a favor.

219
00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:50.890
Go take care of somebody
worse off than me. I'm fine.


220
00:17:51.348 --> 00:17:52.433
- You sure?
- Yeah.


221
00:17:57.354 --> 00:18:00.566
Insomnia's a pretty common
problem around here.


222
00:18:00.858 --> 00:18:02.318
Where'd you ship in from?

223
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.945
Great Britain. Can't
you tell by my accent?


224
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.489
I could tell you're
from the boroughs.


225
00:18:06.572 --> 00:18:08.324
- That's 'cause you're from Brooklyn.
- Yeah.


226
00:18:08.407 --> 00:18:09.867
But judging by your
lack of accent,


227
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.160
you ain't been there in a while.

228
00:18:13.204 --> 00:18:16.123
I went out to California,
graduated from UCLA.


229
00:18:16.582 --> 00:18:18.334
That was my next question.

230
00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:22.838
But hey, I did pick up
little jolly old English


231
00:18:22.963 --> 00:18:25.966
while I was stationed over
there, comes out when I'm mad.


232
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.553
- Yeah? I can't hear it.
- You will.


233
00:18:31.305 --> 00:18:32.431
How's Gustavo?

234
00:18:34.058 --> 00:18:36.310
Another 10 minutes,
he might not have made it.


235
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.855
Leanne's got a good
bedside manner.


236
00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:41.649
He stands a pretty good chance.

237
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:43.067
That's good.

238
00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:49.573
Oh! Jesus! What do you give
for pain here, Doc, soda pop?


239
00:18:49.698 --> 00:18:51.867
Easy, easy.
You lost a lot of blood.


240
00:18:52.743 --> 00:18:54.954
They're a quarter inch
away from your kidneys.


241
00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:56.747
Yeah. Nice wound to match

242
00:18:56.872 --> 00:18:58.207
the one on the other side,
right?


243
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.459
I saw that. And a whole
bunch of others.


244
00:19:00.543 --> 00:19:02.044
They tell a story, yeah?

245
00:19:02.545 --> 00:19:03.838
Yeah. All from combat?

246
00:19:04.171 --> 00:19:05.673
Hell no, Doc.

247
00:19:05.965 --> 00:19:08.926
Street fights down at the Plaza bar
by Carrington Avenue.


248
00:19:09.009 --> 00:19:09.885
You ain't been there?

249
00:19:10.177 --> 00:19:11.220
Man. Never heard of it.

250
00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:14.598
You don't get out to the forgotten
boroughs too much, now, do you?


251
00:19:14.807 --> 00:19:17.810
I have a minor league
team that isn't very good.


252
00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:20.479
I forgot what they were called.

253
00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:27.987
Staten Island Yankees.

254
00:19:29.321 --> 00:19:31.740
A disgrace to their names' sake.

255
00:19:31.824 --> 00:19:36.120
Hey, wait. Hey, I tell you
what, when we're outta here,


256
00:19:36.203 --> 00:19:38.622
you meet me in my block
in my neighborhood,


257
00:19:38.706 --> 00:19:40.499
and you put your money
where your mouth is.


258
00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:42.626
- You're on.
- Okay. We got a deal.


259
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.171
Yeah. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing? Come on.


260
00:19:45.296 --> 00:19:46.630
It's okay.

261
00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:49.341
Who's the officer in charge?
I gotta talk to him.


262
00:19:49.842 --> 00:19:51.343
That would be General Carroll.

263
00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:54.638
That old tofah?

264
00:19:54.763 --> 00:19:56.474
Yep. Makes sense.

265
00:19:57.641 --> 00:19:59.518
No wonder these stitches hurt.

266
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.145
Hey, he does what he can.

267
00:20:05.858 --> 00:20:07.568
Hope you didn't use
that hand on me.


268
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:11.322
- I got it under control.
- How's that?


269
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.241
I use a heavy bag.

270
00:20:14.366 --> 00:20:16.869
Heavy bag. Is that right? Wow.

271
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.371
You are from Brooklyn.

272
00:20:19.997 --> 00:20:20.915
Yeah.

273
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.210
Well tell you what, Doc,

274
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.672
you need to take me to see
the General. That's important.


275
00:20:34.804 --> 00:20:37.515
[percussive hit]

276
00:20:41.143 --> 00:20:42.645
Sir, I'd like to introduce-

277
00:20:42.728 --> 00:20:44.188
You didn't say the password.

278
00:20:46.273 --> 00:20:47.274
Password?

279
00:20:49.026 --> 00:20:52.571
There you go. How's this?
Work for you?


280
00:20:59.537 --> 00:21:01.872
I see you brought
the good stuff over here, sir.


281
00:21:02.832 --> 00:21:06.794
- It's my private stash.
- Man of good taste.


282
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.004
You live up to the legend.

283
00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:14.468
[Sighs] I needed that.

284
00:21:16.262 --> 00:21:18.139
Awful rude of me not
to introduce myself


285
00:21:18.222 --> 00:21:20.015
before drinking you dry, Sir.

286
00:21:20.391 --> 00:21:21.392
Major Porter.

287
00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:23.936
Just call me Jake.

288
00:21:24.061 --> 00:21:27.106
I know who you are. Well-known
in certain circles, sir.


289
00:21:30.109 --> 00:21:32.445
Well, I was a bit prolific
in my younger years.


290
00:21:32.528 --> 00:21:33.612
Some say that made me a target.

291
00:21:33.904 --> 00:21:35.739
I say that's the whole
goddamn point.


292
00:21:37.533 --> 00:21:38.576
Cheers to that.

293
00:21:42.037 --> 00:21:43.664
What can I do for you, Major?

294
00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:49.128
Well, I wanted to meet
the legend and to warn you, sir.


295
00:21:50.754 --> 00:21:51.714
Warn me?

296
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.842
Me and my men were doing
a sweep down the hill


297
00:21:54.967 --> 00:21:57.761
and we were ambushed.
Most of us were wiped out


298
00:21:57.845 --> 00:22:00.639
besides myself and the Private
who almost bled to death.


299
00:22:02.558 --> 00:22:04.643
I lay low for a couple hours,
but I overheard one of them


300
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.729
talking about an attack
on this facility


301
00:22:06.812 --> 00:22:09.064
led by Field Marshall Vukuda.

302
00:22:09.398 --> 00:22:11.859
A real nasty son of a bitch,
in case you never heard of him.


303
00:22:11.942 --> 00:22:12.943
I know he is.

304
00:22:15.237 --> 00:22:17.114
When's this attack
supposed to happen?


305
00:22:18.574 --> 00:22:19.575
That, I don't know, sir.

306
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.328
I was ambushed again before
I could hear anything else.


307
00:22:22.411 --> 00:22:24.205
That's where those fresh
wounds came from.


308
00:22:28.459 --> 00:22:31.128
And what do you want me to do
with this information?


309
00:22:39.178 --> 00:22:40.471
Radio it in, sir?

310
00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.849
[he laughs]
Well, I can certainly try,


311
00:22:43.974 --> 00:22:45.643
but they don't much care
what happens out here.


312
00:22:47.144 --> 00:22:48.813
Well then, I'd say
ready your men.


313
00:22:48.938 --> 00:22:50.314
Take a look around, Major.

314
00:22:51.398 --> 00:22:53.651
We got a few dozen wounded
GIs and half of them


315
00:22:53.734 --> 00:22:55.361
can barely walk,
let alone fight.


316
00:22:57.571 --> 00:23:01.408
You got 127,000 US
soldiers deployed out here


317
00:23:01.534 --> 00:23:03.619
and you're telling me you
can't get one of them out?


318
00:23:03.869 --> 00:23:05.162
Anything else, Major?

319
00:23:07.706 --> 00:23:09.208
We're sharing a toast here, sir.

320
00:23:09.291 --> 00:23:12.211
But we have a situation and
this is what you're gonna do


321
00:23:12.378 --> 00:23:14.046
with the information
you're blessed with.


322
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:18.467
You're welcome to leave
anytime you want.


323
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.805
Then we're fucked.

324
00:23:23.347 --> 00:23:25.099
And now would be a good time.

325
00:23:26.475 --> 00:23:28.310
But then you have no one, sir.

326
00:23:34.942 --> 00:23:36.152
I'm sorry, sir. I...

327
00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:38.571
No need to apologize, Vic.

328
00:23:41.323 --> 00:23:42.324
That'll be all.

329
00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:46.370
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.000
- [Vic] Hey Porter.
- [Porter] What?


331
00:23:51.083 --> 00:23:53.210
That intel. When's it
supposed to happen?


332
00:23:53.377 --> 00:23:54.670
I don't know.

333
00:23:54.753 --> 00:23:56.755
I can go back and try to plead
your case to the General.


334
00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:58.132
This ain't no case, buddy.

335
00:23:58.424 --> 00:24:01.677
[Vic] Look. He's having a bad day
and might be a little drunk.


336
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.429
Don't apologize for him, okay?

337
00:24:03.512 --> 00:24:04.972
It's not your responsibility.

338
00:24:06.307 --> 00:24:07.391
[Vic]
So what do we do?


339
00:24:08.976 --> 00:24:10.102
You ever seen combat?

340
00:24:12.271 --> 00:24:14.440
Don't "Oh" me. I'm asking
you a question.


341
00:24:14.607 --> 00:24:15.900
Have you ever been in combat?

342
00:24:15.983 --> 00:24:17.735
Or do you hide behind
your scalpel


343
00:24:17.818 --> 00:24:19.612
and your syringe
full of morphine all day?


344
00:24:19.945 --> 00:24:21.405
Yeah, I did my basic training.

345
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.575
That's not what I asked.
Have you ever seen combat?


346
00:24:27.077 --> 00:24:28.037
No.

347
00:24:30.247 --> 00:24:32.124
Patching up kids from Missouri,

348
00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:35.044
It's a lot different to
witnessing a 50-caliber shell


349
00:24:35.127 --> 00:24:37.838
rip through a man's chest,
and some of these guys


350
00:24:37.922 --> 00:24:40.508
are your friends. The sound.

351
00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:43.385
That sickening crunch
of blood and bone.


352
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:45.638
The seconds
that feel like hours.


353
00:24:45.763 --> 00:24:47.723
And then you're waiting.
You're just,


354
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.267
you're waiting for the next
bullet to hit you in the back of


355
00:24:50.351 --> 00:24:52.144
your own fucking head
and it's over,


356
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:53.646
and over, and over again.

357
00:24:55.773 --> 00:24:58.526
I put these kids back
together day in, and day out.


358
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:01.904
I seen what happens
over and over.


359
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.532
Okay.

360
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.701
But you ain't seen what's
coming, and maybe you can


361
00:25:07.785 --> 00:25:09.870
understand why I'm
so upset with the General.


362
00:25:10.037 --> 00:25:11.997
This guy used to be
a fucking war hero.


363
00:25:12.123 --> 00:25:14.500
Now, he's just a shadow
of his own reputation


364
00:25:14.792 --> 00:25:16.293
when we need him.

365
00:25:17.962 --> 00:25:18.963
So what do we do?

366
00:25:22.842 --> 00:25:24.009
We evacuate, Doc.

367
00:25:26.137 --> 00:25:27.930
To where? What?

368
00:25:28.139 --> 00:25:30.182
We're understaffed and we're
knee-deep in wounded guys.


369
00:25:30.307 --> 00:25:31.475
Some of 'em can't even walk.

370
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.979
Everybody does their part.
Whoever can fight, fights.


371
00:25:36.272 --> 00:25:38.983
[dramatic music]

372
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.737
[distant gunfire]

373
00:25:48.784 --> 00:25:51.078
- [Fukuda] This, this, or this?
- [Soldier] Yeah.


374
00:25:52.705 --> 00:25:54.373
- Are you sure?
- [Soldier] Sure.


375
00:25:58.335 --> 00:26:01.839
Faster, faster. Do it like
your lives depend on it.


376
00:26:01.964 --> 00:26:02.923
Hey, that's fast.

377
00:26:03.007 --> 00:26:05.468
It's not fast enough, Sergeant,
move, sir.


378
00:26:06.469 --> 00:26:09.472
Hey, five bucks if you
kick his ass.


379
00:26:10.514 --> 00:26:13.309
Can you do it?
Can you punch him?


380
00:26:22.526 --> 00:26:24.361
Well, who woke up the devil,
now?


381
00:26:25.529 --> 00:26:27.072
You should be resting.

382
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.575
I, I, I can't.

383
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.994
This is side I sleep on.
It don't feel so good.


384
00:26:36.165 --> 00:26:37.500
I guess that's it.

385
00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:40.586
I guess I really did
die in here.


386
00:26:41.545 --> 00:26:44.423
- Excuse me?
- Oh, ignore him.


387
00:26:44.507 --> 00:26:46.550
He's been rambling on like
that ever since he woke up.


388
00:26:46.842 --> 00:26:51.222
I can't believe what I'm seeing
here right in front of me


389
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.768
must have died and got
my ass sent to heaven.


390
00:26:57.228 --> 00:26:59.647
Oh no. I promise
you're still alive.


391
00:27:00.022 --> 00:27:03.609
Then how come when I look
around, all I see is angels.


392
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.528
That's because you're in hell.

393
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.864
My apologies.
If I offended any of you.


394
00:27:09.115 --> 00:27:11.909
It's okay. It's just too
much morphine.


395
00:27:12.034 --> 00:27:12.993
Not enough.

396
00:27:15.204 --> 00:27:17.039
What happens if I take too much?

397
00:27:17.373 --> 00:27:18.541
Then it's sweet dreams.

398
00:27:22.461 --> 00:27:24.839
At least I won't have
to pick up a gun again.


399
00:27:27.424 --> 00:27:30.678
[slow orchestral music]

400
00:27:32.638 --> 00:27:34.014
Hey, you doing okay?

401
00:27:36.392 --> 00:27:37.393
I think so.

402
00:27:47.069 --> 00:27:48.612
Where'd you say you was from?

403
00:27:51.073 --> 00:27:52.241
Paris, Texas?

404
00:27:53.742 --> 00:27:57.204
Yeah. That's right.
Born and raised.


405
00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:09.258
Soldier named Pete, he's tall,
dark hair.


406
00:28:12.303 --> 00:28:15.389
He said his mom was Cherokee.

407
00:28:17.475 --> 00:28:19.143
We were at Pearl
Harbor together.


408
00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.104
He took a bullet for me.

409
00:28:29.779 --> 00:28:31.489
He's from Powderly.

410
00:28:31.572 --> 00:28:34.366
That's right outside Paris,
isn't it?


411
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.869
Yeah, I've heard of Powderly.

412
00:28:37.828 --> 00:28:40.623
- Yeah.
- Population, about a hundred.


413
00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:44.460
Yeah.

414
00:28:47.004 --> 00:28:48.130
That's what he said.

415
00:28:50.007 --> 00:28:51.383
Anyway, you.

416
00:28:54.178 --> 00:28:56.013
You run into him back home,

417
00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:01.894
You tell him Ava says,
"Thank you."


418
00:29:06.774 --> 00:29:10.194
Okay. I will.

419
00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:13.197
I will.

420
00:29:17.576 --> 00:29:20.704
[distant explosions]

421
00:29:23.582 --> 00:29:25.876
[sad music]

422
00:29:49.775 --> 00:29:51.235
You know you don't have
to hide that from me.


423
00:29:51.735 --> 00:29:52.862
Yeah, yeah, I know.

424
00:29:55.281 --> 00:29:57.241
The Major's a real asshole,
isn't he?


425
00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:00.286
It's how they manufacture 'em.

426
00:30:01.203 --> 00:30:02.955
Maybe we should order a factory

427
00:30:04.373 --> 00:30:06.792
Fortunately, these bastards
tend to get results.


428
00:30:09.128 --> 00:30:10.129
Maybe.

429
00:30:13.924 --> 00:30:15.009
How's that kid doing?

430
00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.387
You'll need to narrow it
down if you want an answer


431
00:30:18.471 --> 00:30:19.805
I didn't pull outta my ass.

432
00:30:20.806 --> 00:30:23.142
The Southern boy, the amputee.

433
00:30:25.311 --> 00:30:28.063
Oh, him. Big Tex.

434
00:30:29.607 --> 00:30:31.817
Well, aside from trying to come
to terms with losing an arm,


435
00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:34.111
I'd say he's doing as well
as he can given the situation.


436
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.782
Morphine's, really working
wonders with his inhibitions.


437
00:30:37.907 --> 00:30:39.116
Kid's coming out of his shell.

438
00:30:43.204 --> 00:30:44.246
Who's he flirting with?

439
00:30:44.914 --> 00:30:46.040
Take your pick.

440
00:30:47.458 --> 00:30:49.877
Well, he's out of his league.
He doesn't stand a chance.


441
00:30:50.085 --> 00:30:51.003
He's pretty charming.

442
00:30:51.086 --> 00:30:52.755
You should go watch him
before he passes out again.


443
00:30:52.838 --> 00:30:54.089
From the morphine?

444
00:30:54.173 --> 00:30:55.508
From one of them slugging him.

445
00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.180
[loud planes passing]

446
00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:06.435
[distant gunfire]

447
00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:14.443
[glass jingles]

448
00:31:14.568 --> 00:31:17.613
[approaching rumble]

449
00:31:17.738 --> 00:31:20.407
[anxious music]

450
00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:32.545
[army tank rumbling]

451
00:31:35.506 --> 00:31:36.382
[gun cocking]

452
00:31:45.933 --> 00:31:48.144
Major, my weapon!
Give me my weapon!


453
00:31:48.352 --> 00:31:52.273
It's okay. It's okay, Private.
Take a breath. Relax.


454
00:31:53.774 --> 00:31:55.192
There you go.

455
00:31:55.317 --> 00:31:56.318
It hurts like hell

456
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:58.737
I'm sure does,
but you can handle it.


457
00:32:01.532 --> 00:32:02.491
Where are we?

458
00:32:02.575 --> 00:32:03.909
We're in a hospital facility.

459
00:32:04.076 --> 00:32:06.203
Just outside our perimeter.
We're all good.


460
00:32:07.204 --> 00:32:08.581
They're coming for us?

461
00:32:09.206 --> 00:32:11.876
[music beat]

462
00:32:12.001 --> 00:32:14.879
[loud tank engine]

463
00:32:26.474 --> 00:32:28.309
[loud explosion]

464
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:31.896
What the hell was that?

465
00:32:34.815 --> 00:32:35.775
No rest for the wicked.

466
00:32:49.246 --> 00:32:51.373
[Porter]
I'm gonna get you home, soldier.


467
00:32:52.666 --> 00:32:53.834
I'm gonna get you home.

468
00:32:59.173 --> 00:33:01.759
[anxious music]

469
00:33:14.522 --> 00:33:16.148
[man coughing]

470
00:33:25.783 --> 00:33:27.785
[gunshots firing]

471
00:33:43.384 --> 00:33:46.679
[indistinct chatter]

472
00:34:06.574 --> 00:34:08.659
I figured I'd find you two
out here without weapons.


473
00:34:10.326 --> 00:34:11.328
We don't get issued guns.

474
00:34:11.412 --> 00:34:12.872
Don't gimme that shit.

475
00:34:13.956 --> 00:34:16.625
You're soldiers! 
Arm yourselves!

476
00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.392
[gunshots approaching]

477
00:34:55.706 --> 00:34:58.667
[distant voices shouting]

478
00:35:00.795 --> 00:35:03.422
Oh my God.
They're coming for us.


479
00:35:04.215 --> 00:35:05.716
Shh! Be quiet.

480
00:35:08.969 --> 00:35:10.930
You could fucking hear that,
can't you?


481
00:35:13.974 --> 00:35:15.226
Get your shit together.

482
00:35:20.272 --> 00:35:21.941
McGovern, we got evacs!

483
00:35:29.949 --> 00:35:32.284
[men yelling]

484
00:35:45.172 --> 00:35:47.133
Take cover! Take cover!

485
00:35:48.509 --> 00:35:49.635
Get down!

486
00:36:13.909 --> 00:36:15.202
Remember your training.

487
00:36:26.005 --> 00:36:28.841
[birds chirping]

488
00:36:56.911 --> 00:37:00.623
[Jake breathing heavily]

489
00:37:39.912 --> 00:37:41.664
[gunshots]

490
00:37:53.384 --> 00:37:57.138
[sad music]

491
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.401
[Jake breathing heavily]

492
00:38:42.141 --> 00:38:44.059
[Jake sighing]

493
00:39:17.968 --> 00:39:19.428
That was just the first wave.

494
00:39:20.137 --> 00:39:22.056
There'll be more whether
we're ready or not.


495
00:39:22.473 --> 00:39:24.517
Doc, what have you got?
I ain't feeling so good.


496
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.228
I got it.

497
00:39:31.857 --> 00:39:32.817
Sir?

498
00:39:36.403 --> 00:39:39.740
Move these people
to a safe space. Secure.


499
00:39:40.908 --> 00:39:42.159
I need to get back to my office

500
00:39:42.243 --> 00:39:43.828
and burn all
sensitive documents.


501
00:39:52.336 --> 00:39:53.337
Sir?

502
00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.675
Yeah. Carry on, gentlemen.

503
00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:00.469
[group] Yes, sir.

504
00:40:04.932 --> 00:40:06.350
It's good to have him back.

505
00:40:08.436 --> 00:40:09.562
So, what next?

506
00:40:11.564 --> 00:40:13.607
We radio for help
and get the hell outta here.


507
00:40:14.442 --> 00:40:16.610
That's a negative. Not possible.

508
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:19.238
- Why not?
- It's the first place I went.


509
00:40:19.905 --> 00:40:21.490
It's in a million pieces.

510
00:40:21.574 --> 00:40:23.742
- Is it fixable.
- I doubt it.


511
00:40:24.076 --> 00:40:27.204
Shit. Okay. You got
a basement level?


512
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.207
Kind of.

513
00:40:30.416 --> 00:40:31.917
Is it big enough
to hold everyone?


514
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.420
- Course not.
- Well, we work with what we got.


515
00:40:34.503 --> 00:40:37.339
We move in groups. We need
to make a sweep of this place.


516
00:40:37.423 --> 00:40:39.425
See what we can find.
Who knows this place best?


517
00:40:39.884 --> 00:40:41.260
- Most likely we do.
- Yep.


518
00:40:41.343 --> 00:40:43.429
Okay. You take backup,
take a sweep.


519
00:40:43.512 --> 00:40:46.015
Anything you can find guns,
hammers, nails, razor blades,


520
00:40:46.098 --> 00:40:47.016
anything. You got it?

521
00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:48.309
- Got it.
- Got it.


522
00:40:48.392 --> 00:40:51.395
- Isaac. Clear the basement.
- And give my man here a gun.


523
00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:53.689
Thank you, Major.

524
00:40:53.773 --> 00:40:55.191
You owe me a bottle a whiskey,
Private.


525
00:40:55.274 --> 00:40:57.276
- Two bottles for respect.
- Sounds good.


526
00:40:58.235 --> 00:40:59.236
You got any flares?

527
00:41:00.738 --> 00:41:02.865
- I'm sure we do.
- Okay.


528
00:41:03.532 --> 00:41:04.450
Let's move.

529
00:41:10.873 --> 00:41:14.585
[excited music]

530
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:19.965
[she grunts]

531
00:41:21.091 --> 00:41:24.011
[Jake breathing heavily]

532
00:41:37.566 --> 00:41:39.568
- These?
- Go on, yes, yes.


533
00:41:41.278 --> 00:41:43.280
Come on, hurry. Come on!

534
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.157
Okay.

535
00:41:51.288 --> 00:41:53.082
Mia, on this side, check.
Inessa, over here.


536
00:41:53.207 --> 00:41:54.708
Anything we can use medications,

537
00:41:55.167 --> 00:41:57.211
bandages, weapons. Anything.

538
00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:00.339
[Sofia]
Oh, perfect.


539
00:42:00.422 --> 00:42:01.590
Inessa, on this side.

540
00:42:02.508 --> 00:42:04.844
Anything sharp, medication.

541
00:42:06.846 --> 00:42:10.641
[Jake breathing heavily]

542
00:42:18.107 --> 00:42:20.443
[distant gunfire]

543
00:42:20.943 --> 00:42:24.530
[approaching men shouting]

544
00:42:30.202 --> 00:42:31.203
[Mia] Yeah, yes.

545
00:42:34.206 --> 00:42:35.583
[Sofia] Come on, girls,
we gotta move.


546
00:42:35.666 --> 00:42:36.876
[Inessa] This is good, right?

547
00:42:39.545 --> 00:42:41.380
Okay. Yes.

548
00:42:42.173 --> 00:42:43.257
Whatever you can carry.

549
00:42:52.516 --> 00:42:55.186
Well, there it is.

550
00:42:55.895 --> 00:42:59.023
- There's what?
- Stress reliever, right?


551
00:43:00.191 --> 00:43:02.735
By the way, wonderful job
being off the mainland.


552
00:43:03.444 --> 00:43:05.488
That's a potato sack
I found in the jungle.


553
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.574
- Filled it with sand, right?
- Yeah.


554
00:43:08.657 --> 00:43:09.784
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.

555
00:43:09.867 --> 00:43:11.076
Maybe you can help me fix that

556
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.953
and hang it back up
before we leave,


557
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.747
maybe I'll take a few swings.

558
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.457
Well, I think you're gonna
have plenty opportunity


559
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.375
to hit other things
other than a potato sack.


560
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.004
This works. Let's get
'em down here.


561
00:43:46.779 --> 00:43:48.155
[percussive hit]

562
00:44:04.255 --> 00:44:05.756
[machine gun fire]

563
00:44:05.923 --> 00:44:10.136
[men shouting
and women screaming]


564
00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:26.569
Move, move, move! Move!
Let's go!


565
00:44:30.865 --> 00:44:31.782
He's hit!

566
00:44:40.583 --> 00:44:42.626
Stay with me. Stay with me.

567
00:44:45.796 --> 00:44:46.797
Here you go.

568
00:44:48.591 --> 00:44:50.092
[explosion]

569
00:44:50.676 --> 00:44:51.927
- Cover me.
- Go, go, go, go!


570
00:44:52.011 --> 00:44:54.847
[rapid gunfire]

571
00:45:01.479 --> 00:45:03.230
[Vic screaming]

572
00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:07.651
[rapid gunfire continues]

573
00:45:14.408 --> 00:45:17.578
[anxious music ends]

574
00:45:22.166 --> 00:45:23.083
He's gone.

575
00:45:23.876 --> 00:45:26.003
Morphine! I need some
morphine here!


576
00:45:26.128 --> 00:45:27.463
- I'm coming!
- You're wasting your time.


577
00:45:27.838 --> 00:45:30.716
- Shut up.
- Stay with me. Come on, man.


578
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:31.884
Stay with me.

579
00:45:36.472 --> 00:45:38.557
[Vic]
Stay with me. Shit!


580
00:45:46.774 --> 00:45:48.776
I told you, you were
wasting your time.


581
00:45:52.196 --> 00:45:55.157
That man had a wife
and a daughter


582
00:45:55.324 --> 00:45:58.202
Everyone has a wife
and a daughter.


583
00:46:00.538 --> 00:46:01.455
You hear me?

584
00:46:01.539 --> 00:46:02.498
Let it go, Vic.

585
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:04.083
Listen to your friend.

586
00:46:04.208 --> 00:46:06.001
There's gonna be another
wave coming down here.


587
00:46:06.085 --> 00:46:08.170
And we don't want to be
here when that happens.


588
00:46:09.171 --> 00:46:10.673
He's right. We need to move.

589
00:46:17.596 --> 00:46:18.597
Okay.

590
00:46:20.307 --> 00:46:21.976
Let's see if we can
salvage that thing.


591
00:46:22.059 --> 00:46:24.145
-It may come in handy later, okay
-Right away, sir.


592
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.604
Make it happen.

593
00:46:25.729 --> 00:46:27.273
I'm gonna clear the holes.

594
00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.986
God dammit.

595
00:46:32.236 --> 00:46:36.949
Here! Come on, hurry up!
Here, here, move! Here!


596
00:46:37.241 --> 00:46:38.617
Come on, come on!

597
00:46:38.701 --> 00:46:40.578
Let's move, move! Hurry! Hurry!

598
00:46:40.661 --> 00:46:41.745
These are too far apart.

599
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:43.831
We gotta move them closer
together. We gotta fit everybody.


600
00:46:43.914 --> 00:46:46.041
Come on, we gotta have
room for everybody, down.


601
00:46:46.876 --> 00:46:48.252
In a row, like this.

602
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:53.841
[gun clicks]

603
00:46:58.971 --> 00:47:00.139
[Jake exhales]

604
00:47:00.306 --> 00:47:02.308
[gunshot]

605
00:47:03.809 --> 00:47:05.144
[Jake exhales]

606
00:47:33.255 --> 00:47:36.008
[gunshots]

607
00:47:41.847 --> 00:47:43.182
[rapid gunfire]

608
00:47:57.863 --> 00:47:59.990
[gunshots]

609
00:48:09.708 --> 00:48:11.001
[Jake exhales]

610
00:48:18.259 --> 00:48:19.301
[gunshots]

611
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.405
[baseball bat clatters]

612
00:48:41.574 --> 00:48:44.577
[Jake breathing heavily]

613
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.712
[Jake groans]

614
00:49:05.306 --> 00:49:07.892
[opera music]

615
00:49:55.147 --> 00:49:57.483
[Glass clatters to floor]

616
00:50:52.204 --> 00:50:53.706
[gunshot]

617
00:50:59.462 --> 00:51:00.379
First kill?

618
00:51:11.307 --> 00:51:12.600
Just remember something.

619
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.685
If it wasn't him, it was me.

620
00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.229
Then it was you. You got that?

621
00:51:20.107 --> 00:51:21.108
Got it.

622
00:51:24.695 --> 00:51:25.696
Too much caffeine?

623
00:51:28.574 --> 00:51:29.658
I don't know what it is.

624
00:51:29.742 --> 00:51:32.369
It started after I deployed,
I, I can control it.


625
00:51:33.871 --> 00:51:35.206
Thanks for having my back.

626
00:51:35.372 --> 00:51:38.209
I hope to return the favor.
Let's move.


627
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.477
I think, I think I need
a shot of morphine.


628
00:51:56.644 --> 00:51:57.728
Oh.

629
00:51:58.938 --> 00:52:00.022
You have more,

630
00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:02.942
and there won't be any
for the rest of us.


631
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.446
- My nerves.
- Hey, son.


632
00:52:07.947 --> 00:52:08.906
What I tell you?

633
00:52:08.989 --> 00:52:10.991
Nerves ain't gonna do
no good for you around here.


634
00:52:12.451 --> 00:52:14.411
A shot of morphine
will keep me calm


635
00:52:15.037 --> 00:52:18.040
A shot of morphine is
gonna knock you out.


636
00:52:26.173 --> 00:52:29.468
I need you aware,
'cause like Major said,


637
00:52:29.802 --> 00:52:32.680
I need you to have
my front and my back.


638
00:52:35.224 --> 00:52:36.809
Unless I die peacefully.

639
00:52:38.811 --> 00:52:40.104
You not gonna die.

640
00:52:41.355 --> 00:52:44.150
You not going die.
Look at me, son.


641
00:52:45.317 --> 00:52:46.277
What's your name?

642
00:52:46.777 --> 00:52:48.028
Adell Dollins.

643
00:52:48.195 --> 00:52:50.823
Adell Dollins. I like
the name. Adell Dollins.


644
00:52:51.407 --> 00:52:53.993
Repeat after me Adell.
I'm not going die.


645
00:52:54.368 --> 00:52:56.912
- I'm not going to die.
- Ooh, louder, Adell.


646
00:52:57.371 --> 00:52:59.206
- I'm not going die.
- I'm not going die.


647
00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:00.958
- I'm not gonna die!
- I'm not gonna die!


648
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:02.460
I'm not gonna die!

649
00:53:03.002 --> 00:53:04.462
Yeah, God got a plan

650
00:53:08.674 --> 00:53:10.342
and look what we got here.

651
00:53:19.643 --> 00:53:20.644
Not bad.

652
00:53:24.565 --> 00:53:27.651
- Where you from, kid?
- California.


653
00:53:28.611 --> 00:53:29.820
You should have enlisted.

654
00:53:30.404 --> 00:53:32.573
Could always use a pair
of hands like yours.


655
00:53:34.909 --> 00:53:37.661
- I tried.
- What do you mean, you tried?


656
00:53:41.248 --> 00:53:42.208
And?

657
00:53:48.005 --> 00:53:49.298
[loud explosion]

658
00:53:50.216 --> 00:53:52.009
Jesus Christ, that was close.

659
00:53:53.969 --> 00:53:55.095
Y'all boys ready?

660
00:53:57.681 --> 00:54:00.518
[energetic music]

661
00:54:06.941 --> 00:54:08.067
Hold.

662
00:54:23.874 --> 00:54:26.377
[men shouting]

663
00:54:50.317 --> 00:54:51.318
No!

664
00:54:56.699 --> 00:54:57.783
Porter!

665
00:55:04.248 --> 00:55:06.208
I think it went clean through.
You okay?


666
00:55:06.417 --> 00:55:08.002
I know you're not, let's go.

667
00:55:08.377 --> 00:55:09.962
- Is he good?
- Yeah.


668
00:55:10.337 --> 00:55:12.715
Over the shoulder, big man.
There you go. Let's move.


669
00:55:50.169 --> 00:55:52.379
[in Japanese]

670
00:56:01.806 --> 00:56:03.307
What are you going to do?

671
00:56:36.048 --> 00:56:37.133
[Ava] You're going to die.

672
00:56:45.683 --> 00:56:47.435
Come on, put me down.

673
00:56:50.438 --> 00:56:52.940
-Empty
-Your shoulder,


674
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:54.275
it's not lethal.

675
00:56:56.277 --> 00:56:57.194
I'm out.

676
00:56:58.863 --> 00:57:00.281
The General's got guns
in his office.


677
00:57:00.364 --> 00:57:01.490
Wait here.

678
00:57:02.241 --> 00:57:04.577
Give me a hand, come on. Up!

679
00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:13.002
[sad music]

680
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:21.927
Guys.

681
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:34.398
He went down fighting.

682
00:57:37.777 --> 00:57:38.778
He died a hero.

683
00:57:50.039 --> 00:57:51.081
It's empty.

684
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.961
Same.

685
00:57:58.839 --> 00:58:01.509
I'm gonna lie down guys.
I don't feel so good.


686
00:58:15.106 --> 00:58:16.440
They took everything.

687
00:58:22.738 --> 00:58:23.781
You okay?

688
00:58:27.034 --> 00:58:27.910
No.

689
00:58:30.121 --> 00:58:31.163
No.

690
00:58:34.959 --> 00:58:37.628
So it will be with
the resurrection of the dead.


691
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:44.343
The body that is sown is
perishable is raised imperishable.


692
00:58:46.303 --> 00:58:49.348
It is sown weak.
It is raised with power.


693
00:58:50.808 --> 00:58:53.436
It is sown and dishonor,
it is raised in glory.


694
00:59:00.276 --> 00:59:02.194
It is sown as a natural body.

695
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:07.241
It rises as a spiritual body.

696
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.163
If there is a spiritual body,
there is a natural body.


697
00:59:15.374 --> 00:59:16.292
Corinthians.

698
00:59:21.839 --> 00:59:23.716
That verse got me through
a lot of long nights


699
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:24.967
since I left home.

700
00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:29.305
How long you been here?

701
00:59:32.308 --> 00:59:33.184
You know.

702
00:59:34.143 --> 00:59:35.394
I used to count the days.

703
00:59:37.104 --> 00:59:39.940
Now, I don't remember
the day I shipped out.


704
00:59:41.358 --> 00:59:44.236
The good thing is I don't obsess
over time anymore. I just, uh...


705
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:47.573
I just wanna get home someday.

706
00:59:49.909 --> 00:59:51.243
Yeah. You and me both.

707
00:59:57.958 --> 00:59:59.710
Boroughs coming together, yeah?

708
01:00:02.171 --> 01:00:03.506
Boroughs coming together.

709
01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.009
We ain't that different
after all, are we?


710
01:00:08.177 --> 01:00:09.637
No. No, we're not.

711
01:00:15.726 --> 01:00:17.144
How about them out there?

712
01:00:22.441 --> 01:00:25.945
I figure they're just as scared
as we are, soldiers.


713
01:00:27.404 --> 01:00:28.447
Following orders.

714
01:00:33.744 --> 01:00:34.995
And I quit.

715
01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.748
Why deprive yourself, Doc?

716
01:00:37.873 --> 01:00:40.000
It could be your last
night on this earth.


717
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:44.797
A forgotten borough
finally making some sense.


718
01:00:45.339 --> 01:00:46.924
Hey.

719
01:00:48.759 --> 01:00:50.136
Cuz I'm from Jersey?

720
01:00:52.513 --> 01:00:54.473
[they laugh]

721
01:00:56.308 --> 01:00:58.394
You know how you could tell
somebody's from Jersey?


722
01:00:58.561 --> 01:00:59.520
How?

723
01:01:01.605 --> 01:01:03.607
They never shut
the fuck up about it.


724
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:06.735
You don't hear me
denying that one.


725
01:01:13.951 --> 01:01:17.830
Sweet Lord. That tastes
good right now.


726
01:01:17.955 --> 01:01:19.373
There you go, see?

727
01:01:19.498 --> 01:01:21.876
Who says people from Jersey
don't have any taste.


728
01:01:21.959 --> 01:01:23.335
[Connor]
Just don't let my wife know.


729
01:01:25.254 --> 01:01:26.839
She'd actually kill me.

730
01:01:27.673 --> 01:01:30.634
She'd say I'm setting
a piss-poor example for my kid.


731
01:01:31.677 --> 01:01:33.095
You got kids, Porter?

732
01:01:36.307 --> 01:01:37.808
Me? No.

733
01:01:39.101 --> 01:01:41.645
- Not that I know of, anyways.
- Oh, is that right?


734
01:01:41.771 --> 01:01:43.647
No, I'm just saying
that I did a lot of traveling.


735
01:01:43.773 --> 01:01:46.609
So you know, I wouldn't be
surprised if there's some


736
01:01:46.734 --> 01:01:48.319
hard-nosed little bastard
running around,


737
01:01:48.402 --> 01:01:49.862
out there somewhere that
looks like me.


738
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:52.698
How about you?

739
01:01:57.244 --> 01:01:59.830
Me and my wife, Jenny,
We want kids. It's just...


740
01:02:00.956 --> 01:02:02.208
not in the cards yet.

741
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.460
You didn't try before you left.

742
01:02:05.294 --> 01:02:09.173
Oh, like drunk jack rabbits.
It just didn't happen.


743
01:02:10.007 --> 01:02:11.717
It will. Now when it does,

744
01:02:12.384 --> 01:02:14.762
do your best to keep
outta situations like this


745
01:02:14.845 --> 01:02:17.807
'cause this is ain't no
place for no kid.


746
01:02:20.351 --> 01:02:21.936
That's all we can hope for,

747
01:02:22.603 --> 01:02:24.271
that our kids do
better than we do.


748
01:02:25.272 --> 01:02:26.732
That's what I'm
hoping for my boy.


749
01:02:27.441 --> 01:02:28.818
Damn smart kid.

750
01:02:29.777 --> 01:02:32.863
Lot smarter than I was
at his age. Early bloomer.


751
01:02:35.074 --> 01:02:36.617
Now, you just gotta get
him outta Jersey.


752
01:02:37.952 --> 01:02:41.205
At least to UCLA like this
smarmy bastard, right here.


753
01:02:41.288 --> 01:02:42.873
Oh there it is. There it is.

754
01:02:46.877 --> 01:02:50.381
What's the first thing you're
gonna do the day you get back?


755
01:02:50.506 --> 01:02:51.715
Who you're talking to,
me or him?


756
01:02:52.007 --> 01:02:53.509
Whoever fucking answers first.

757
01:02:53.634 --> 01:02:55.010
I don't know, he's your buddy.
You tell me.


758
01:02:55.094 --> 01:02:56.762
Hey, be my guest.

759
01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:59.557
Why, you embarrassed?
You hiding something over there?


760
01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:00.975
I'll get it outta you.

761
01:03:01.058 --> 01:03:02.476
Try it. I'm Irish.

762
01:03:04.437 --> 01:03:05.479
Me?

763
01:03:06.063 --> 01:03:08.065
You know, I never really
thought about it that much.


764
01:03:11.527 --> 01:03:13.070
I'm thinking maybe a ball game.

765
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.073
First pitch of the season.

766
01:03:17.241 --> 01:03:21.162
Smell of that fresh green grass,
the tall beer in my hand,


767
01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:22.538
a beautiful woman on my arm.

768
01:03:23.706 --> 01:03:25.958
One of those New York
stadium hot dogs in my mouth.


769
01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:28.502
Yeah, it's simple.

770
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.338
That's what I look forward to.

771
01:03:31.839 --> 01:03:33.549
Sounds like
the perfect day to me.


772
01:03:35.676 --> 01:03:36.552
How about you?

773
01:03:38.429 --> 01:03:40.222
I'm from Jersey.
You wouldn't like it.


774
01:03:41.557 --> 01:03:42.475
Try me.

775
01:03:44.477 --> 01:03:46.437
Would love to take
my wife and kid out.


776
01:03:47.146 --> 01:03:48.647
Stop in each state.

777
01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.108
Show them the country.

778
01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:53.819
Travel.

779
01:03:55.946 --> 01:03:58.032
Show my boy what
his dad was out protecting.


780
01:04:00.451 --> 01:04:01.410
Show him why.

781
01:04:04.163 --> 01:04:05.164
That sounds nice.

782
01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.042
Just skip the rest of Jersey
and parts of Connecticut.


783
01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:10.169
Other than that, it's
just fucking beautiful.


784
01:04:10.461 --> 01:04:11.629
I guess so.

785
01:04:15.508 --> 01:04:17.343
I haven't heard
anything in a while.


786
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:21.472
Maybe we should get him
down with the others.


787
01:04:21.972 --> 01:04:23.933
Wait for the
reinforcements to find us.


788
01:04:25.768 --> 01:04:27.061
That's if anyone comes.

789
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:30.147
They don't call this
Purple Heart Ridge for nothing.


790
01:04:31.982 --> 01:04:32.942
Let's get outta here.

791
01:04:42.076 --> 01:04:43.786
What do you plan on doing
with that thing?


792
01:04:44.578 --> 01:04:47.331
You ever see the Babe hit
one out of Yankee stadium?


793
01:04:48.165 --> 01:04:49.125
Dozens of times.

794
01:04:59.677 --> 01:05:00.970
Are you good?

795
01:05:03.305 --> 01:05:05.558
As long as there's a nice
piece-of-shit cot


796
01:05:06.142 --> 01:05:07.893
with someone else's
blood smeared in it


797
01:05:07.977 --> 01:05:10.312
waiting for me downstairs,
I'm ready for anything.


798
01:05:11.105 --> 01:05:13.441
Then keep up. Come on.

799
01:05:13.607 --> 01:05:15.526
Guess you don't know
Jersey very well.


800
01:05:30.207 --> 01:05:31.876
[gunshot]

801
01:05:55.775 --> 01:05:56.859
Hey Doc.

802
01:05:57.526 --> 01:06:00.279
It took Williamson 127
home runs in five years.


803
01:06:00.946 --> 01:06:02.656
You think he'll catch the Babe?

804
01:06:02.948 --> 01:06:04.950
I think the Babe's
record's pretty safe.


805
01:06:10.873 --> 01:06:12.208
Let's see what we can do.

806
01:06:17.254 --> 01:06:20.174
[Vic and Porter screaming]

807
01:06:27.723 --> 01:06:29.683
[man screaming]

808
01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:57.503
[Vic breathing heavily]

809
01:06:59.588 --> 01:07:02.424
[Vic screaming]

810
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.392
All right, clear the chamber!

811
01:07:11.475 --> 01:07:14.228
Get out of there, get
out of the way, come on!


812
01:07:14.478 --> 01:07:16.480
Get my bag. Go get someone
to clean it, right now.


813
01:07:16.605 --> 01:07:18.315
Come on. No, no, no, come on.

814
01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:20.443
- [Vic] I could save you.
- No.


815
01:07:20.568 --> 01:07:22.278
Yes. Yes, I can.

816
01:07:22.403 --> 01:07:23.696
No, you can't.

817
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.448
No.

818
01:07:26.866 --> 01:07:28.242
He hit the femoral artery.

819
01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:31.620
It won't take too long now.

820
01:07:34.874 --> 01:07:36.167
Protect them.

821
01:07:40.838 --> 01:07:43.048
No, no, no, no, no.

822
01:07:43.174 --> 01:07:47.011
Vic, make sure my boy gets this.

823
01:07:49.847 --> 01:07:52.099
He's not old enough
to understand it yet...


824
01:07:56.562 --> 01:07:57.897
but he will be.

825
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:25.673
He was a good man.

826
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:31.180
They're gonna make it
down here. You know that.


827
01:08:31.262 --> 01:08:32.388
It's just a matter of time.

828
01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.394
Then we'll keep fighting.

829
01:08:46.445 --> 01:08:47.946
I'm gonna take the halls.

830
01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:50.574
I'm gonna kill as many
of these guys as I can.


831
01:08:50.699 --> 01:08:52.827
Anybody makes it down here,
it's on you.


832
01:08:53.035 --> 01:08:54.245
I'm coming with you.

833
01:08:58.374 --> 01:08:59.667
If I don't make it back here,

834
01:08:59.749 --> 01:09:01.544
I want you to know
it's been an honor.


835
01:09:02.419 --> 01:09:03.294
Likewise.

836
01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.092
You keep an eye on him.

837
01:09:09.843 --> 01:09:10.845
Don't worry.

838
01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:12.637
Got him covered.

839
01:09:13.931 --> 01:09:15.807
You good to hold fort for me,
Private?


840
01:09:17.142 --> 01:09:18.894
Well, we're in luck.

841
01:09:19.352 --> 01:09:21.271
'Cause I just happen
to learn from the best.


842
01:09:22.273 --> 01:09:23.356
Good whiskey.

843
01:09:23.983 --> 01:09:25.943
Great whiskey, two bottles.

844
01:09:26.026 --> 01:09:27.069
You just make it back.

845
01:09:28.945 --> 01:09:30.448
You remember our bet, right?

846
01:09:32.408 --> 01:09:33.868
You still think you can win?

847
01:09:34.243 --> 01:09:35.202
You're damn right.

848
01:09:45.129 --> 01:09:46.964
Loser buys Dodger tickets.

849
01:09:52.845 --> 01:09:53.971
Get the door

850
01:09:55.306 --> 01:09:56.849

Quiet.

856

Shit.

[distant shouting]

862
01:13:21.971 --> 01:13:23.055

Good shot, kid.

889

in Paris, Texas.


890
01:18:23.814 --> 01:18:24.857
Oh my god!

891
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.233
Please, no!

892
01:18:28.652 --> 01:18:30.279
Don't die!

893
01:18:31.906 --> 01:18:33.365
Come on, come on.

894
01:18:36.243 --> 01:18:37.244
Don't die.

895
01:18:39.497 --> 01:18:42.458
[suspenseful music]

896
01:18:47.463 --> 01:18:48.881
[gunshot]

897
01:18:53.886 --> 01:18:55.137
You did good.

898
01:19:07.441 --> 01:19:12.113
[sad music]

899
01:19:34.593 --> 01:19:36.637
[energetic music]

900
01:19:36.762 --> 01:19:40.266
- [hammer thudding]
- {men yelling]


901
01:19:45.354 --> 01:19:46.897
[he grunts]

902
01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:51.944
[sad music]

903
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:55.781
And the others?

904
01:19:59.535 --> 01:20:00.578
Is that it?

905
01:20:01.203 --> 01:20:02.204
Is that all?

906
01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:04.874
I'm sure there's more coming.

907
01:20:05.207 --> 01:20:07.501
I don't think we could handle
another wave like that.


908
01:20:09.962 --> 01:20:11.755
Is this everything we had
in the building?


909
01:20:12.506 --> 01:20:14.925
As far as we know, yeah.

910
01:20:16.051 --> 01:20:17.219
[Vic]
Goddamn.


911
01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:19.972
We could use their ammo,
but that won't last the night.


912
01:20:20.097 --> 01:20:21.348
Yeah. That'll buy us some time,

913
01:20:21.432 --> 01:20:22.683
but that's not the solution.

914
01:20:23.225 --> 01:20:24.477
So what now?

915
01:20:25.186 --> 01:20:27.104
We just sit here and die?

916
01:20:35.905 --> 01:20:37.239
Maybe we won't have to.

917
01:20:38.282 --> 01:20:40.242
I don't think that's enough.

918
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:43.037
It's a flare gun.

919
01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:47.124
Maybe we can get some
reinforcements.


920
01:20:48.584 --> 01:20:49.627
Are you sure?

921
01:20:53.339 --> 01:20:55.716
I'm outta other options.

922
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:57.510
Where are you gonna do this?

923
01:20:57.676 --> 01:20:58.636
The roof?

924
01:20:59.845 --> 01:21:01.972
No, I think I'd be
a target there.


925
01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:06.143
Maybe around back.

926
01:21:06.227 --> 01:21:08.062
Maybe there's a little
clearing I can go to.


927
01:21:09.814 --> 01:21:11.607
So you just gonna leave us?

928
01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:14.443
Why don't you just wait
till Porter gets back?


929
01:21:19.865 --> 01:21:21.742
I don't think
Porter's coming back.


930
01:21:28.124 --> 01:21:29.208
I'll be right back.

931
01:21:30.543 --> 01:21:32.128
[Sofia] You know
what's out there.


932
01:21:33.712 --> 01:21:34.839
A minefield.

933
01:21:46.976 --> 01:21:48.477
If I'm not back in 20,

934
01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:50.771
you get everybody you can.

935
01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:55.276
You run like hell until you
find someone friendly, okay?


936
01:21:58.946 --> 01:22:00.197
Hopefully, it won't
come to that.


937
01:22:55.836 --> 01:22:56.962
How long has it been?

938
01:22:57.338 --> 01:22:58.714
About two minutes.

939
01:22:59.256 --> 01:23:00.132
That's it?

940
01:23:01.592 --> 01:23:04.220
Time goes by so slow
when there's no gunfire.


941
01:23:04.637 --> 01:23:05.638
Don't worry.

942
01:23:06.972 --> 01:23:08.265
He knows what he's doing.

943
01:23:12.061 --> 01:23:13.521
[percussive hit]

944
01:23:40.965 --> 01:23:42.091
[metallic click]

945
01:24:04.488 --> 01:24:05.531
He can do it.

946
01:24:09.326 --> 01:24:11.078
He talked me through
losing an arm.


947
01:24:13.164 --> 01:24:14.874
He can make it
through a minefield.


948
01:24:30.973 --> 01:24:33.809
[metallic click]

949
01:25:01.253 --> 01:25:04.173
[fire crackling]

950
01:25:45.506 --> 01:25:46.882
[twig snaps]

951
01:25:52.429 --> 01:25:55.432
[Vic yelling]

952
01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.274
[fists thudding]

953
01:26:25.671 --> 01:26:26.589
Go!

954
01:26:29.133 --> 01:26:30.009
Go!

955
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:32.428
Go!

956
01:26:42.646 --> 01:26:44.398
[he grunts]

957
01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.876
[Vic screaming]

958
01:27:09.173 --> 01:27:12.051
[flare gun hisses]

959
01:27:28.859 --> 01:27:31.946
Wait, there it is!

960
01:27:33.405 --> 01:27:34.323
He did it.

961
01:27:48.838 --> 01:27:51.507
[Porter] So it will be with
the resurrection of the dead.


962
01:27:52.842 --> 01:27:54.844
The body that is sown
is perishable.


963
01:27:56.053 --> 01:27:57.638
It is raised imperishable.

964
01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:01.809
It is sown weak.
It is raised with power.


965
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.604
It is sown and dishonored,
is raised in glory.


966
01:28:06.939 --> 01:28:08.899
It is sown as a natural body,

967
01:28:10.317 --> 01:28:13.529
it rises as a spiritual body.

968
01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.452
If there is a spiritual body,
there is a natural body.


969
01:28:22.705 --> 01:28:26.750
[sad music]

970
01:28:43.684 --> 01:28:46.145
[inaudible speech]
