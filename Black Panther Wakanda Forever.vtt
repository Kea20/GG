Shuri: (Whispering) Bast...

2
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.718
Time is running out.

3
00:00:09.886 --> 00:00:12.388
Please allow me to heal
my brother of this illness,

4
00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:15.600
and I will never
question your existence again.

5
00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.442
His heart rate is dropping
fast. Where are we?

6
00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:19.812
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:21.439
Shuri: Griot,
give me the controls.

8
00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:22.899
Griot: As you wish, Princess.

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:24.984
(Indistinct chatter)

10
00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:28.738
(System trilling)

11
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:30.072
What is the confidence rate?

12
00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:31.824
Griot: 25%.

13
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:33.951
We'll have to try another way.

14
00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:35.846
Griot:
King t'challa's heart rate

15
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.080
has fallen to 31 beats
per minute.

16
00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:40.791
Princess,
you should go be by his side.

17
00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.294
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

18
00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.629
(Chatter continues)

19
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:45.713
Get out!

20
00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.135
(Panting)

21
00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:53.095
What is the confidence rate?

22
00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.597
Griot: 29.1%.

23
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.723
Print it!

24
00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.563
Griot: Princess,
I am aware of the urgency,

25
00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:04.273
but I must warn you,

26
00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:06.234
this synthetic heart-shaped herb

27
00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:08.778
has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.

28
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:11.864
I don't care! Has to work.

29
00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:14.158
(Machine whirring)

30
00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:21.791

(Footsteps approaching)

32
00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:32.176
Griot.

33
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.302
Griot: Yes, Princess?

34
00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:35.721
What's my brother's heart rate?

35
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.307
(Breath es shakily)

36
00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.103
Your brother

37
00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:45.690
is with the ancestors.

38
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.903
(Gasps softly)

39
00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:54.031
(Crying) No.

(Shaman speaking xhosa)

41
00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:10.923

70
00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.147
Chairperson: It is an honor for me...

71
00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:39.900
To invite her majesty,
queen ramonda,

72
00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:41.402
daughter of lumumba,

73
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:43.445
sovereign ruler
of the kingdom of wakanda.

74
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:58.627
Us secretary of state:
Mr. Chairperson,

75
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:04.216
I believe I speak for
all the member states here

76
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.094
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed

77
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.263
in wakanda's failure

78
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:13.809
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

79
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.978
to tackle
international challenges,

80
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.563
to share resources,

81
00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.857
and full cooperation

82
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.400
concerning vibranium.

83
00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.901
(In French)

84
00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:40.711
(In English)
I now give the floor

85
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.713
to her majesty, queen ramonda.

86
00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:52.681
It has always been our policy

87
00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:57.770
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

88
00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:02.149
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

89
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:07.821
but because of the dangerous
potential of you.

90
00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:18.791
(Computer trills)

91
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.126
(In French)

92
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.587
(Power shuts down)

93

(Woman gasps)

99
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:52.116
(In English)
You perform civility here.

100
00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:55.202
But we know what you whisper

101
00:08:55.828 --> 00:08:57.579
in your halls of leadership

102
00:08:57.663 --> 00:09:00.541
and in your military facilities.

103
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.673
"The king is dead.

104
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.428
"The black panther is gone.

105
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.304
(Metal creaking)

106
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:17.599
"They have lost their protector.

107
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.521
(Rousing music playing)

108
00:09:23.522 --> 00:09:26.734
Ramonda: "Now is our time...

109
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.361
"To strike."

110
00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:33.949
(Merc shouts in French)

111

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.258
(Mercs grunting and groaning)

116
00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:58.432
Aneka, where is your spear?

117
00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.017
Shuri gave me these to try.

118
00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:02.603
- (Aneka grunts loudly)
- (Groans)

119
00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.646
You know, I like them better.

120
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.410
Okoye: Our foremothers
gave us the spear...

121
00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:09.151
Because it is precise,
elegant...

122
00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:11.862
And deadly.

123
00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:14.740
(Spear clangs)

124
00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.159
It will not change
under my watch.

125
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.537
Yes, general.

126
00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:22.956
I told you not to bring them.

127
00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:27.961
Last night
there was another attack

128
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.547
on one of
our outreach facilities.

129
00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:35.302
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

130
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:39.389
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

131
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:40.599
(Cell phones vibrating)

132
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.393
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

133
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.190
(Rousing music playing)

134
00:10:55.948 --> 00:10:57.074
(In xhosa)

135
00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.371
(In French)

136
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.625
(In English) Let our gracious
response to this incursion

137
00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:09.127
be an olive branch.

138
00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:14.091
Further attempts
on our resources

139
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:17.469
will be considered
an act of aggression

140
00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:21.181
and met with
a much steeper response.

141
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.352
We mourn the loss of our king.

142
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.772
But do not think for a second

143
00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:31.149
that wakanda
has lost her ability

144
00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:33.777
to protect our resources.

145
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:38.073
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some

146
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:41.326
to find vibranium
outside of wakanda,

147
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:45.664
and wish you the best of luck.

148
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.546
Pilot: (On radio)
This is rotor 625

149
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:53.922
requesting clearance to land.

150
00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.279
Dr. Graham: All right.
Meet you down there.

151
00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:00.304
Yeah.

152
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.018
I thought you retired!

153
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.227
I thought I had too.

154
00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:09.521
They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance

155
00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:10.772
of finding vibranium.

156
00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:11.940
Oh, less than that.

157
00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.526
(Machinery whirring)

158
00:12:15.861 --> 00:12:18.405
(Crew shouting indistinctly)

159
00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:34.922
Here we go.

160
00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.066
Salazar: (On comms)
Cabin pressure is stable

161
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.926
at negative one p-s-i.

162
00:12:44.473 --> 00:12:45.891
At 800 feet,

163
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.018
passing through thermocline.

164
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.728
All my life supports
in the green.

165
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.772
(Beeping)

166
00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:52.940
Copy you.

167
00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.659
Salazar: We've touched down.

168
00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.126
Dr. Graham:
Perfect. So, Salazar,

169
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.836
you are near the site
right there.

170
00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:18.215
Salazar: Yeah, it's astonishing.

171
00:13:20.217 --> 00:13:21.551
The drill seemed to make contact

172
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:23.011
with a metallic substance.

173
00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:26.306
Jackson: Whatever it is,
it's solid.

174
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.684
I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.

175
00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:33.313
Smitty: I'll be.

176
00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.524
Vibranium in the ocean.

177
00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.567
Let's go ahead and get
the detector out of there,

178
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.403
since it's the only one
we've got.

179
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.864
Salazar: Heading towards
the vibranium detector.

180
00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.579
(Power shutting down)

181
00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:55.961
Okay, Salazar,
we just went dark.

182
00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.255
Salazar: Yeah.
The rig lost power.

183
00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.048
Copy that.
I'm gonna fix it up here.

184
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.260
(Eerie vocal call in distance)

185
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.720
Jackson: What the hell was that?

186
00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.406
(Voice vocalizing in eerie tone)

187
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.289
Salazar: Jackson,

188
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.207
tell me you're seeing this?

189
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.460
Dr. Graham: Hang on.
Salazar's heart rate.

190
00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:38.670
Hey, uh, Salazar,
can you give me a visual?

191
00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:42.799
Salazar:
It's a phantom jellyfish.

192
00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:44.509
I've never seen one this color.

193
00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:46.595
Emergency dive team, stand by.

194
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:49.765
Salazar, uh,
we just lost Jackson's vitals.

195
00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:50.974
Can you see him?

196
00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:53.268
(Air hissing)

197
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.609
No. He's gone. (Shudders)

198
00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.694
Can you clarify? What do
you mean by, "he's gone"?

199
00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:04.362
(Breathing shakily)

200
00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:05.947
Salazar, do you copy?

201
00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.133
(Salazar gasping and whimpering)

202
00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:08.825
- Salazar?
- (Screams)

203
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:09.910
(Screaming stops)

204
00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:14.247
Man: (On radio) Smitty,
we got a situation out here.

205
00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:19.336
(Voices harmonizing eerily)

206
00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:27.260
What's that sound?

207
00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:29.387
West, you got a visual
on what's making that sound?

208
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.395
West, how copy, over?

209
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:42.150
(On radio)
West, you got a visual?

210
00:15:42.234 --> 00:15:44.236
(Voices harmonizing melodiously)

211
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.730
Smitty: It's some kind
of Sonic attack.

212
00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.422
Hey, smitty, earplugs.

213
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.924

We are under attack.

217
00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:14.724
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

218
00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.936
Copy. Mayday, mayday,
this is rotor 625.

219
00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.455
We are requesting
assistance immediately.

220
00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:20.772
It's the wakandans.

221
00:16:20.856 --> 00:16:22.774
(Breathing shakily)

222
00:16:22.858 --> 00:16:23.984
It has to be.

223
00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:27.404
(Voices chanting harmoniously)

224
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.626
Henderson.

225
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.044
Smitty, we gotta go.

226
00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:44.129
Henderson!

227
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.673
Let's go.

228
00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:48.800
(Vocalizing stops)

229

What's going on?

230
00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:51.678
Get off the edge.

Now! Go!

Spin! Spin them off!

246
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.231
Okay. They're gone!

- We're good.
- (Line ringing)

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.257
Where is the strike team?

253
00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.634
It wasn't the wakandans.
They... they were blue.

254
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:13.802
Everyone is dead...

- (Alarm blaring)

256
00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.430
Shit. What is going on?

257
00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.349
Pilot: We're getting
pulled backwards.

258
00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.935
Oh, my god.

Anderson Cooper: Queen ramonda
of the nation of wakanda

263
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.939
gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday,

264
00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.482
while members of her military

265

sudden death

last year.

powerful nation,

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:25.457
as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...

Princess, however...

You're disrupting
my train of thought.

287
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:40.990
Mother.

289
00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.244
The queen is here.

290
00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:46.454
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

291
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.789
I think that one day

artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

mother.

It does exactly
what I tell it to do.

295
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.549
Yeah, if only children
were the same.

296
00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.469
Everyone seems to be
working diligently.

297
00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:05.682
Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.

298
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:07.475
There could be any number of

299
00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.227
unknown threats on the horizon,

300
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.979
and they're creating solutions.

301
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.023
Ramonda: Oh, what is this?

302
00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.817
Exo suits for our army.

303
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.403
It grants the user
super-human strength,

304
00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.655
speed, and durability.

305
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:23.158
But, as always, okoye had notes.

306
00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:24.492
What were her notes?

307
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:25.952
She hates them.

308
00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:33.668
What about recreating
the heart-shaped herb?

309
00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:35.962
Have you made
any progress on that?

310
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.255
Griot: Excuse me, Princess.

311
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:40.550
Nakia, daughter of yaa,
is trying to reach you again.

312
00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:41.634
Maybe you should...

313
00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.470
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

314
00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:44.721
as I instructed.

315
00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.306
Griot: As you wish, Princess.

316
00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.350
We do not need the herb, mother.

317
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.395
We need new technology.

318
00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:53.730
What of the black panther?

319
00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.612
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

320
00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.864
The black panther
is a relic, mother.

321
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:05.450
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the herb,

322
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.702
I was trying to save my brother.

323
00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:11.164
Ramonda: Oh, shuri.

324
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.041

Do you know what day it is?

327
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:27.764
Tuesday.

328
00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:30.558
The date, child.

329
00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:33.686
(Shuri sighs)

330
00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:38.066
Brother's passing.

331
00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:40.026
One year ago today.

332
00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:51.246
Have you planned anything?

333
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:55.250
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

334
00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:57.252
- Right now?
- Right now.

335
00:22:57.919 --> 00:22:59.546
And you can leave
your kimoyo beads here.

336
00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:00.755
- Mother.
- No, no.

337
00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:02.674
You won't need them
where we are going.

338
00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:10.390
And the other two. Yes.

339
00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:12.267
(Shuri scoffs)

340
00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:24.028
(Distant animal calls)

(Insects chirping)

343
00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:38.001
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

344
00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:40.670
It is the only way
you are going to heal

345
00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:43.089
from the wound caused
by t'challa's death.

346
00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:44.465
I'm fine, mother.

347
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.844
You don't have to worry
about me.

348
00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:52.724
He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.

349
00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:54.642
T'challa is dead,

350
00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:57.604
but that doesn't mean
he is gone.

351
00:23:58.104 --> 00:24:00.982
When that illness
took your brother from us,

352
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:05.653
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

353
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.531
But I still took time
in the bush.

354
00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:11.951
I wandered until I found water.

355
00:24:12.118 --> 00:24:13.494
And I sat.

356
00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:16.789
Then I did this ritual

357
00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:19.334
that I am about to show you now.

358
00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:21.836
(Spiritual music playing)

359
00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:26.132
I found your brother
in the breeze,

360
00:24:27.425 --> 00:24:30.803
pushing me gently, but firm.

361
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:33.973
Like his hand on my shoulder.

362
00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:37.810
It took some time,

363
00:24:39.187 --> 00:24:41.147
but he was there.

364
00:24:47.362 --> 00:24:48.780
He wasn't there, mother.

365
00:24:50.573 --> 00:24:52.033
The presence that you felt

366
00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.035
was just a construct
of your mind.

367
00:24:54.118 --> 00:24:56.162
(Spiritual music continues)

368
00:24:56.245 --> 00:24:59.999
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort orjoy.

369
00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:02.126
That's all.

370
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:04.879
Hmm.

371
00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:11.886
What construct
does your mind create

372
00:25:12.053 --> 00:25:14.013
when you think of your brother?

373
00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.933
Does it offer you comfort?

374
00:25:18.309 --> 00:25:19.686
Or torment?

375
00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:23.481
(Spiritual music continues)

376
00:25:29.821 --> 00:25:30.822
(Sighs)

377
00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:34.450
Come, child.

378
00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:47.213
How did you get this?

379
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.506
What does it matter?

380
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.134
What does this have to do
with your ritual?

381
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:54.637
Ramonda: Burning
of the funeral garments

382
00:25:54.804 --> 00:25:57.056
marks the end
of the mourning period

383
00:25:57.223 --> 00:26:00.143
and the beginning
of a new relationship

384
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:02.478
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

385
00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:04.564
I'm not doing this, mother.

386
00:26:05.898 --> 00:26:07.275
If I sit

387
00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:09.986
and think about my brother
for too long,

388
00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:14.282
it won't be these clothes
I'll burn.

389
00:26:15.533 --> 00:26:17.076
It will be the world...

390
00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:20.037
And everyone in it.

391
00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:22.373
(Sighs) Shuri...

392
00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:29.756
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you

393
00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:31.549
about your brother.

394
00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:34.093
(Elephants trumpeting)

395
00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:37.096
Mother, wait!

396
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.640
- What are you doing?
- (Footsteps rumbling)

397
00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:41.100
(Ramonda panting)

398
00:26:41.184 --> 00:26:42.226
(Rumbling fades)

399
00:26:46.522 --> 00:26:48.524
(Uneasy music playing)

400
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:54.322
(Suspenseful music playing)

401
00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:06.334
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

402
00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:07.752
It isn't.

403
00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:11.047
Ramonda: Stop! Right there!

404
00:27:11.714 --> 00:27:14.550
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

405
00:27:16.093 --> 00:27:17.595
This place is amazing.

406
00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:20.598
The air is pristine.

407
00:27:22.058 --> 00:27:23.059
And the water...

408
00:27:24.602 --> 00:27:26.729
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

409
00:27:27.063 --> 00:27:30.233
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

410
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.735
That never have to change
who they were.

411
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.404
What reason do you have

412
00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:37.281
to reveal your secret
to the world?

413
00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:40.326
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

414
00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:42.370
Who are you?

415
00:27:42.537 --> 00:27:43.746
Man: I have many names.

416
00:27:44.372 --> 00:27:47.458
My people call me k'UK'ulkan...

417
00:27:50.378 --> 00:27:52.088
But my enemies call me namor.

418
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:56.425
The American military
detected vibranium

419
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:58.094
under my nation's domain.

420
00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:02.640
I was able to
stop them from minin' it,

421
00:28:03.558 --> 00:28:04.851
but we need wakanda's help

422
00:28:04.934 --> 00:28:06.686
to prevent it
from happenin' again.

423
00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:10.773
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

424
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.442
Vibranium only exists here.

425
00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:14.944
In wakanda.

426
00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:16.487
Mother, he's covered in it.

427
00:28:20.366 --> 00:28:24.120
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

428
00:28:24.662 --> 00:28:26.998
In response,
other nations have begun

429
00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:28.499
searching the planet for it.

430
00:28:28.666 --> 00:28:32.086
His choice has compromised us.

431
00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:35.256
I think wakanda
could find the scientist

432
00:28:35.339 --> 00:28:36.632
and bring them to me?

433
00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:41.387
It is only fair that wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

434
00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:44.015
You do not sneak into my country

435
00:28:44.098 --> 00:28:46.809
and tell me what is fair.

436
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:51.355
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

437
00:28:52.148 --> 00:28:54.859
And they have
incomparable strength.

438
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:58.487
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

439
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:01.949
(Inhales sharply)

440
00:29:04.493 --> 00:29:06.954
When you have the scientist,
blow into this,

441
00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:08.456
place it in the ocean.

442
00:29:08.915 --> 00:29:10.917
I'll be there
shortly afterwards.

443
00:29:14.462 --> 00:29:15.671
For your own sake,

444
00:29:16.172 --> 00:29:18.090
don't mention anything about me

445
00:29:18.174 --> 00:29:19.967
to anyone outside of wakanda.

446
00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:30.603
Did you see the wings
on his ankles?

447
00:29:31.354 --> 00:29:33.356
(Ramonda breathing shakily)

448
00:29:45.368 --> 00:29:46.911
(Ominous music playing)

449
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:48.204
Shuri: How did he do that?

450
00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:50.581
Ramonda:
We must convene the council.

451
00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:54.210
Okoye: Heaven scrapers
had no evidence

452
00:29:54.293 --> 00:29:56.003
of any activity at all.

453
00:29:58.089 --> 00:30:02.927
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

454
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.470
If my soldiers were present,

455
00:30:04.887 --> 00:30:07.098
this "fish man"

456
00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:09.100
would be bound before us
as we speak.

457
00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:11.435
If your muscle brains
were present,

458
00:30:11.602 --> 00:30:12.895
they would still be there

459
00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:14.772
choking on their
fuzzy adornments.

460
00:30:14.855 --> 00:30:16.107
You bald-headed demon...

461
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.067
Show some respect, you two.

462
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.235
M'Baku: Respect?

463
00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:21.821
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

464
00:30:21.904 --> 00:30:22.989
Watch your tone, Jabari!

465
00:30:23.072 --> 00:30:25.157
(Jabaris hooting)

466
00:30:26.993 --> 00:30:27.994
(Yells)

467
00:30:28.077 --> 00:30:29.578
(Spears th u d)

468
00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:37.962
Okoye: As I was saying,

469
00:30:38.129 --> 00:30:40.923
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

470
00:30:41.007 --> 00:30:42.341
And nothing
on the radar as well.

471
00:30:42.508 --> 00:30:45.970
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

472
00:30:46.137 --> 00:30:47.638
Ramonda: He was not alone.

473
00:30:47.722 --> 00:30:50.016
And claims to command
a massive army.

474
00:30:50.099 --> 00:30:54.395
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

475
00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:55.521
So he can kill them?

476
00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:56.689
Do it.

477
00:30:58.983 --> 00:31:00.776
We never had to face an enemy

478
00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.611
with access to vibranium before.

479
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:05.573
And we have no black panther
to protect us.

480
00:31:05.656 --> 00:31:07.283
M'Baku: That is because
this wise council

481
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.952
allowed killmonger
to take the throne

482
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:12.119
and burn up all of your
precious heart-shaped herb.

483
00:31:12.163 --> 00:31:14.665
M'Baku,
what would you have us do?

484
00:31:14.832 --> 00:31:17.209
We should find the fish man
and kill him.

485
00:31:18.002 --> 00:31:21.964
If we do
what he is asking for now,

486
00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:24.550
what is to stop him
from coming back

487
00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:26.427
and asking for more?

488
00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:29.430
(Sighs)

489
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:32.767
(Believe by busiswa et al
playing on speakers)

490
00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:36.896
Ramonda: As you were.

491
00:31:38.606 --> 00:31:42.735
Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?

492
00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:44.070
It's you.

493
00:31:44.862 --> 00:31:46.781
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

494
00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:48.365
This thing can detect

495
00:31:48.449 --> 00:31:50.659
the altered frequency
of vibranium

496
00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:53.954
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

497
00:31:54.038 --> 00:31:55.831
Whoever built this is brilliant.

498
00:31:56.165 --> 00:31:57.583
Come, look.

499
00:31:58.167 --> 00:32:00.836
Some are custom parts
and others look like

500
00:32:01.003 --> 00:32:02.755
they gathered it
from a junkyard.

501
00:32:02.922 --> 00:32:05.174
I am still struggling to believe

502
00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:08.219
that vibranium exists
outside of wakanda.

503
00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:10.638
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

504
00:32:10.805 --> 00:32:12.515
Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

505
00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:13.682
so it's reasonable

506
00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:15.810
that the other one
just landed there.

507
00:32:15.976 --> 00:32:18.062
This changes everything
that we know.

508
00:32:18.229 --> 00:32:21.690
The great mound.
All of the legends and fables.

509
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:24.276
Those stories
are seared in my mind.

510
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:26.237
That sounds very painful.

511
00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:30.533
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

512
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.869
- I do have an idea.
- Ramonda: Mm.

513
00:32:34.662 --> 00:32:35.996
I'm going to need the Princess.

514
00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:38.165
Out of the question.

515
00:32:38.249 --> 00:32:40.459
She is in no state
to be in the field.

516
00:32:40.543 --> 00:32:41.877
(In xhosa)

517
00:32:42.837 --> 00:32:45.381
(In English) It may
do her some good to get out.

518
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.509
It might just be exactly
what she needs.

519
00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:52.012
Besides, I can do
this American operation

520
00:32:52.096 --> 00:32:53.180
with my eyes closed.

521
00:32:53.264 --> 00:32:56.475
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

522
00:32:56.642 --> 00:32:58.060
This namor,

523
00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.479
he snuck past our defenses.

524
00:33:00.563 --> 00:33:02.565
That will never happen again.

525
00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:04.233
He was not alone.

526
00:33:04.984 --> 00:33:06.152
She'll be with me.

527
00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:08.404
Shuri: So,

528
00:33:09.363 --> 00:33:10.447
when are we leavin'

529
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:12.700
so I can see
my favorite colonizer?

530
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.578
(Can't stop by red hot
chili peppers playing)

531
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.646
(Song continues on headphones)
Can't stop

532
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.422
-addicted to the shindig
-(Insect buzzing)

533
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:28.799
Chop top,
he says I'm gonna win big...

534
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.801
(Exhales)

535
00:33:30.885 --> 00:33:31.886
Whoa.

536
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:34.138
Distant cousin
to the reservation

537
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:36.891
defunkt the pistol
that you pay for

538
00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:39.310
this punk, the feeling
that you stay for...

539
00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:40.811
(Sighs)

540
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.855
(Scoffs) Come on.

541
00:33:44.857 --> 00:33:46.317
Yeah, I got it.

542
00:33:47.234 --> 00:33:48.611
I got it.

543
00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.114
Will you slow down?

544
00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:54.742
(Buzzing stops)

545
00:33:54.825 --> 00:33:56.076
(Trills softly)

546
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:00.372
You didn't think to call?

547
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:01.916
Now, why would I have
your number?

548
00:34:01.999 --> 00:34:03.918
- (Shuri snickers)
- (Chuckles sarcastically)

549
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:05.794
We are looking for the scientist

550
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:07.671
who built
the vibranium detector.

551
00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:09.448
So it was you guys
in the Atlantic?

552
00:34:10.424 --> 00:34:12.092
Come on. Mining ship.

553
00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:13.510
Lot of casualties.

554
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.221
What happened?

555
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.430
Seriously?

556
00:34:18.432 --> 00:34:21.310
It was a joint operation.
Us and the seals.

557
00:34:21.477 --> 00:34:24.438
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

558
00:34:24.605 --> 00:34:25.606
friends of mine.

559
00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:27.066
Gone.

560
00:34:27.233 --> 00:34:28.275
Just like that.

561
00:34:28.734 --> 00:34:29.735
You throw in the fact

562
00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:30.879
that they were tracking
vibranium...

563
00:34:30.903 --> 00:34:33.572
I can assure you wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

564
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.574
So who was it?

565
00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:39.039
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

566
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:41.247
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

567
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.999
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

568
00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:46.252
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

569
00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:47.920
before anything else happens.

570
00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:50.506
You owe me, Ross.

571
00:34:50.673 --> 00:34:52.174
You owe my brother.

572
00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:57.012
Okay, look.

573
00:34:57.805 --> 00:35:00.057
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

574
00:35:00.224 --> 00:35:02.309
for less than
I'm about to give you now.

575
00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:03.727
And we got a new director.

576
00:35:04.395 --> 00:35:05.771
She's watching me like a hawk.

577
00:35:05.938 --> 00:35:08.524
We will be very, very careful.

578
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:10.776
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

579
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:12.444
The us needs another machine

580
00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:14.172
and this kid is
the only person in the world

581
00:35:14.196 --> 00:35:15.447
who knows how to build one.

582
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:16.573
So they're comin' for her.

583
00:35:16.657 --> 00:35:17.657
A kid?

584
00:35:17.992 --> 00:35:20.160
- (Students chattering)
- (Muffled rap song playing)

585
00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:29.753
- Hey.
- You forgot to venmo me.

586
00:35:29.837 --> 00:35:33.090
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

587
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:34.925
Eight hundred
was yesterday's price.

588
00:35:35.009 --> 00:35:36.176
It's a band today.

589
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.970
That's predatory. I...

590
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:40.931
I built the whole robotic hand.

591
00:35:41.015 --> 00:35:43.559
You just corrected
the grip algorithm.

592
00:35:43.726 --> 00:35:45.102
And what grade did you get?

593
00:35:48.397 --> 00:35:49.523
(Cell phone chimes)

594
00:35:50.816 --> 00:35:52.568
(Sighs) Thanks.

595
00:35:55.571 --> 00:35:56.798
Shuri: Is that an iPhone I see?

596
00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:57.823
Okoye: Primitive.

597
00:35:58.324 --> 00:35:59.325
(Kimoyo beads trill)

598
00:35:59.408 --> 00:36:00.409
(In xhosa)

599
00:36:01.368 --> 00:36:03.203
(In English)
We have located the scientist.

600
00:36:03.287 --> 00:36:05.039
She is
in the American equivalent

601
00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:06.874
of a wakandan village school.

602
00:36:06.957 --> 00:36:08.167
Ramon da: A school?

603
00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:11.086
Please tell me
it is a professor.

604
00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.047
It's a student, mother.

605
00:36:13.213 --> 00:36:14.631
We can't give her to namor.

606
00:36:15.466 --> 00:36:18.135
Ramonda: Bring this student
back to wakanda.

607
00:36:19.762 --> 00:36:21.221
(In xhosa)

608
00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:23.098
(Kimoyo beads trill)

609
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.042
(In English)
I've got it from here.

610
00:36:25.392 --> 00:36:27.186
Wait. Maybe I should
speak with her.

611
00:36:27.353 --> 00:36:28.645
It will be more discreet.

612
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:31.065
I can be discreet.

613
00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:35.819
What?

614
00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:37.404
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

615
00:36:38.572 --> 00:36:39.758
It's the wrong shade, isn't it?

616
00:36:39.782 --> 00:36:40.866
It's the right shade.

617
00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:42.534
Fenty 440. You look good.

618
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:46.121
I can blend in as a student.

619
00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:48.248
I can do this.

620
00:36:52.086 --> 00:36:53.587
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

621
00:36:54.088 --> 00:36:56.715
(Limoncello by og dayv
playing inside room)

622
00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:06.850
Girl: Yo!

623
00:37:07.017 --> 00:37:08.102
Riri Williams?

624
00:37:11.522 --> 00:37:13.065
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.

625
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:14.268
You gotta go to the website.

626
00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:17.611
It's an encrypted file.

627
00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:18.946
I wanted to airdrop it.

628
00:37:19.446 --> 00:37:21.281
(Gasps) You the...

629
00:37:22.825 --> 00:37:23.826
Whew.

630
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:25.494
You're Princess shuri.

631
00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:28.664
What the hell
are you doing here?

632
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:30.457
Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?

633
00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:35.587
I'm here about
the vibranium detector

634
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:37.172
that you built for the CIA.

635
00:37:38.674 --> 00:37:40.843
I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.

636
00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:42.594
I made that
for my metallurgy class.

637
00:37:42.761 --> 00:37:44.763
- A school project?
- Riri: Yeah.

638
00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:46.932
My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.

639
00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:50.602
To be young, gifted,
and black though, right?

640
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.312
(Riri chuckles)

641
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.899
Y'all probably don't say that
in wakanda.

642
00:37:58.193 --> 00:37:59.236
How old are you?

643
00:38:00.195 --> 00:38:01.488
Nineteen.

644
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:03.157
Brilliance at a young age

645
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.784
is not always accepted
by the elders.

646
00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:08.787
How long did it take you?

647
00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:10.038
Couple months.

648
00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:11.874
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was

649
00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:13.797
finding big enough
mylar sheets to cover the...

650
00:38:15.544 --> 00:38:17.087
Wait, did I piss offwakanda?

651
00:38:17.171 --> 00:38:18.255
Not just us.

652
00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:20.340
This place is no longer safe
for you.

653
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.635
Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.

654
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:27.514
I got differential equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

655
00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:31.018
Okay.

656
00:38:32.102 --> 00:38:33.312
Okay.

657
00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:35.689
You wait right here.

658
00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:39.193
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

659
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.611
Ooh!

660
00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:44.281
Shuri: I had it under control.

661
00:38:45.199 --> 00:38:47.701
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

662
00:38:47.868 --> 00:38:49.536
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

663
00:38:50.204 --> 00:38:51.371
Get out!

664
00:38:51.538 --> 00:38:52.539
Hey.

665
00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:55.542
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

666
00:38:55.626 --> 00:38:56.627
- toward me!
- Oh!

667
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.937
See how they teach the children

668
00:38:57.961 --> 00:38:59.254
to treat their guests? Mm!

669
00:38:59.338 --> 00:39:00.380
(Riri grunts)

670
00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:04.259
(Gasps) Oh...

671
00:39:04.343 --> 00:39:05.677
You brought a spear in here?

672
00:39:05.761 --> 00:39:08.138
You brought a spear in here.

673
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:09.973
I like her.

674
00:39:10.474 --> 00:39:11.642
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

675
00:39:11.725 --> 00:39:13.286
- Put it down, put it...
- Riri: Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

676
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.895
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

677
00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:16.647
Okoye: It's all right, Princess.

678
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.065
Small, small girl.

679
00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:22.069
I am going to give you
two options.

680
00:39:22.236 --> 00:39:24.404
You can come to wakanda,

681
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:26.865
conscious or unconscious.

682
00:39:27.658 --> 00:39:30.410
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

683
00:39:30.577 --> 00:39:32.538
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

684
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:33.830
(Shuri laughs)

685
00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:36.500
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

686
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.044
- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.

687
00:39:39.211 --> 00:39:40.879
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

688
00:39:41.338 --> 00:39:42.714
And she can deal

689
00:39:42.798 --> 00:39:45.467
with that merman
with the winged ankles

690
00:39:45.634 --> 00:39:48.554
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

691
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.847
- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.

692
00:39:50.931 --> 00:39:52.371
- (Gasps)
- Shuri: Come on. Let's go.

693
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.100
What?

694
00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:02.943
Okoye: What exactly
is this place?

695
00:40:03.652 --> 00:40:05.772
Riri: I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

696
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:10.242
He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.

697
00:40:10.742 --> 00:40:12.327
I just have to grab
my work laptop.

698
00:40:15.038 --> 00:40:17.833
Please don't touch anything.

699
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.127
Okoye: You don't have to worry
about that.

700
00:40:20.294 --> 00:40:21.712
Riri: It may not look like much,

701
00:40:21.795 --> 00:40:23.797
but it's my life's work in here.

702
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.881
Okoye: Mm-hmm.

703
00:40:24.965 --> 00:40:28.385
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

704
00:40:28.552 --> 00:40:29.553
Yeah.

705
00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:32.598
And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?

706
00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:35.726
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

707
00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:39.021
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

708
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:41.106
Riri: Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

709
00:40:41.273 --> 00:40:43.317
Had to build a functional
quantum computer

710
00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:45.402
just to crack
my own encryption. (Chuckles)

711
00:40:45.569 --> 00:40:47.946
What is it you're building
here? Is it stark tech?

712
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.448
I said don't touch anything.

713
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:51.241
Griot: Princess,
American law enforcement

714
00:40:51.325 --> 00:40:52.701
has arrived at your location.

715
00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:54.244
- Shuri: Shit.
- Who was that?

716
00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:55.662
My ai.

717
00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:58.749
Okoye: They are surrounding us.

718
00:41:02.753 --> 00:41:05.380
I thought you said a merman
was after me.

719
00:41:05.547 --> 00:41:06.590
That's the feds.

720
00:41:07.424 --> 00:41:09.426
(Tense music playing)

721
00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:22.481
Oh, I do not need this shit
right now!

722
00:41:22.564 --> 00:41:24.775
I swear to god,
I was doing so well!

723
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:27.569
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

724
00:41:27.653 --> 00:41:30.280
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of wakanda

725
00:41:30.364 --> 00:41:32.032
is gonna show up at my doorstep

726
00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:33.742
and then shit about to pop off.

727
00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:34.826
I think

728
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.579
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

729
00:41:37.663 --> 00:41:41.375
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

730
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:44.961
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

731
00:41:45.045 --> 00:41:46.522
FBI agent: (On speaker)
This is the federal bureau

732
00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:47.547
of in vestigation.

733
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:48.733
Because of your little machine.

734
00:41:48.757 --> 00:41:50.133
So those popo out there...

735
00:41:50.217 --> 00:41:51.402
FBI agent: We have
surrounded the premises.

736
00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:52.570
Are the very least
of your worries.

737
00:41:52.594 --> 00:41:55.138
Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.

738
00:41:55.305 --> 00:41:57.724
General,
they've got us surrounded.

739
00:41:57.891 --> 00:41:59.476
Maybe we should just split up.

740
00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:01.061
(Chuckles) Out of the question.

741
00:42:01.228 --> 00:42:02.354
Does this vehicle work?

742
00:42:05.941 --> 00:42:09.236
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

743
00:42:09.403 --> 00:42:11.238
Don't even think about it.

744
00:42:11.321 --> 00:42:13.407
Besides, there are three of us.

745
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:16.034
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

746
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:17.661
Shuri: Whoo!

747
00:42:17.744 --> 00:42:18.995
I knew it.

748
00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:21.581
Don't tell me that
you built this in two months.

749
00:42:21.665 --> 00:42:24.710
(Scoffs) I spent years
on this. On and off.

750
00:42:24.793 --> 00:42:27.671
- (Device whirring)
- Nice. Have you flown it yet?

751
00:42:27.838 --> 00:42:28.964
That thing can fly?

752
00:42:29.047 --> 00:42:31.007
There's an entire
YouTube channel

753
00:42:31.091 --> 00:42:32.884
dedicated to sightings of me.
(Chuckles)

754
00:42:32.968 --> 00:42:34.052
Shuri: That's awesome.

755
00:42:34.511 --> 00:42:35.863
FBI agent: We have
a warrant to detain...

756
00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:37.647
- Shuri: Come.
- The student riri Williams.

757
00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:38.932
Wireless transmitter,

758
00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:40.100
so we can communicate.

759
00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:41.309
Don't try to scurry off.

760
00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:43.520
FBI agent: General okoye,
Princess shuri,

761
00:42:43.687 --> 00:42:45.731
come out with your hands up.

762
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.566
Okoye: What a hunk ofjunk.

763
00:42:47.649 --> 00:42:49.526
Hey, please be careful.

764
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:50.962
FBI agent: You will not
be placed under arrest.

765
00:42:50.986 --> 00:42:51.987
Keys are on the seat.

766
00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:53.756
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge,

767
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.091
we can lose them
in Boston traffic.

768
00:42:55.115 --> 00:42:56.992
General,
we really need to split up.

769
00:42:57.159 --> 00:42:59.244
Listen to me.
We are not in your lab.

770
00:42:59.327 --> 00:43:00.412
We are in the field.

771
00:43:00.579 --> 00:43:01.997
Now, get her in the car.

772
00:43:02.581 --> 00:43:03.707
Always shouting at me.

773
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.422
(Kimoyo beads trill)

774
00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:12.674
Griot: The tactical unit
will breach the entrance

775
00:43:12.758 --> 00:43:15.635
in three, two,

776
00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:17.137
- one.
- (Powering up)

777
00:43:18.513 --> 00:43:20.140
FBI: FBI! Don't move!

778
00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:21.927
SWAT: What the hell is that?

779
00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:24.311
Oh, shit!
She got an iron man suit?

780
00:43:24.394 --> 00:43:26.354
- Fall back!
- Stay where you are!

781
00:43:26.813 --> 00:43:27.856
(Officers groan)

782
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.026
Okoye: Guess it can fly.

783
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:32.486
Shuri: Griot!
Griot: Yes, Princess.

784
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:34.196
- Now!
- Remote piloting activated.

785
00:43:34.279 --> 00:43:35.530
Okoye: Shuri! No!

786
00:43:35.614 --> 00:43:36.740
(Tires screeching)

787
00:43:36.823 --> 00:43:39.075
(They want/t, butno by
tobe nwigwe and fat playing)

788
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:43.205
Clip, pole, smoke, fade

789
00:43:43.288 --> 00:43:44.372
they want the drip

790
00:43:44.456 --> 00:43:46.917
(screams) Let's go!

791
00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:49.127
Shuri: Griot.

792
00:43:50.295 --> 00:43:51.588
Give me a visual.

793
00:43:51.671 --> 00:43:53.024
They want the glow
they want my soul

794
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:54.591
they want the wave 1 keep a clip

795
00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:55.675
I keep a pole

796
00:43:55.759 --> 00:43:58.053
who want the smoke
who want the fade

797
00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:01.097
okoye: Griot...
Griot: Yes, general?

798
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:03.058
Take me to the Princess

799
00:44:03.225 --> 00:44:05.894
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your cpu,

800
00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:07.354
you will not be able to process

801
00:44:07.437 --> 00:44:09.231
basic input for a millennia.

802
00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:10.677
Griot: Just one moment, general.

803
00:44:10.816 --> 00:44:12.192
Shuri: Okoye,
I'm on my way to you.

804
00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:14.277
Bounce, crouch or get slouched

805
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:15.654
my whole hood devout

806
00:44:15.737 --> 00:44:17.155
(engine rewing)

807
00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:19.282
My mama taught me
not to be a harlot

808
00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:21.409
my granny help me
take the wise route

809
00:44:21.493 --> 00:44:23.245
although I'm itty bitty
sitting pretty

810
00:44:23.328 --> 00:44:26.456
griot, give me control
of this vehicle right now!

811
00:44:26.623 --> 00:44:28.667
Griot: I am clearing you a path.

812
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.462
(Tires screeching)

813
00:44:33.463 --> 00:44:34.798
She's all yours, general.

814
00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:36.758
Manual drive engaged.

815
00:44:41.471 --> 00:44:43.181
(Siren blaring)

816
00:44:47.352 --> 00:44:49.521
Look, I know you on my bumper

817
00:44:49.604 --> 00:44:51.398
I know you want my thunder

818
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:53.400
why the laws wanna take us under

819
00:44:53.483 --> 00:44:54.943
we need to find
an extraction point.

820
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.611
Shuri: There's one
across the river.

821
00:44:56.695 --> 00:44:58.321
I know you want my thunder

822
00:44:58.405 --> 00:45:00.156
why the laws wanna take us under

823
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.117
why the hell am I in this jungle

824
00:45:02.826 --> 00:45:04.327
hey, yo, they cuttin' off
the bridge.

825
00:45:04.411 --> 00:45:06.246
(Sirens wailing)

826
00:45:08.582 --> 00:45:10.709
Griot: Princess,
there is a surveillance drone

827
00:45:10.792 --> 00:45:12.586
- locked onto you.
- How high?

828
00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:14.087
Griot: Thirty-thousand feet.

829
00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:16.553
We don't cry 'bout
how they try take us all out

830
00:45:17.007 --> 00:45:18.508
look -they want the drip

831
00:45:19.009 --> 00:45:20.010
they want my soul

832
00:45:20.093 --> 00:45:21.094
hang on.

833
00:45:21.803 --> 00:45:22.804
I got it.

834
00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:27.475
Come on, riri.

835
00:45:27.893 --> 00:45:30.145
You gotta find
these differential equations.

836
00:45:30.312 --> 00:45:32.105
Once the relative velocity
evens out...

837
00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:34.148
Shuri: Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone

838
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:35.233
without an oxygen mask.

839
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:40.530
Griot: Oxygen level is now 55%.

840
00:45:41.489 --> 00:45:43.617
Riri: Twenty-eight
thousand feet.

841
00:45:44.743 --> 00:45:47.329
Griot: Oxygen level is now 30%.

842
00:45:50.457 --> 00:45:51.893
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

843
00:45:51.917 --> 00:45:53.460
my euler angles
and that should...

844
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.570
That should drop it
right on the...

845
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.091
(Grunts, gasps)

846
00:46:01.968 --> 00:46:03.803
Griot: Oxygen, 0%.

847
00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:09.142
The drone is no longer
tracking you.

848
00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.062
Altitude, 500 feet and falling.

849
00:46:12.145 --> 00:46:13.585
Shuri: (On comms)
Riri! Are you okay?

850
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:15.774
- Riri!
- Yea h.

851
00:46:19.361 --> 00:46:20.445
(On comms) I'm good.

852
00:46:21.363 --> 00:46:22.632
Officer: Incoming!
Woman: Get out of the way!

853
00:46:22.656 --> 00:46:23.657
(In xhosa)

854
00:46:23.823 --> 00:46:24.926
- (In English) Shit!
- Riri: And no worries.

855
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.952
I got a special delivery
for y'all in three,

856
00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:28.536
two, one...

857
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.164
Shuri: Nice one, riri!

858
00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:32.582
We got the glow we got the soul

859
00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:33.875
we got the wave

860
00:46:33.959 --> 00:46:35.418
riri: Whool

861
00:46:36.628 --> 00:46:37.963
(gasps, yelps)

862
00:46:38.505 --> 00:46:39.506

(Device whirs)

865
00:47:08.493 --> 00:47:11.579
(Gasping) What just happened?
Shun!

866
00:47:12.122 --> 00:47:13.123
Shun!

867
00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:25.301

(Kimoyo beads trill)

869
00:47:29.222 --> 00:47:31.474
Griot: The Princess's vitals
are stable, general.

870
00:47:31.641 --> 00:47:34.227
She should regain
consciousness momentarily.

871

(Grunts)

879
00:48:08.678 --> 00:48:10.764
Take another step closer

880
00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:13.058
and iwill kill you all.

881
00:48:13.767 --> 00:48:15.327
Officer: (On speaker)
Drop your weapons!

00:50:20.894 --> 00:50:22.562
- (Crackles)
- (Grunts)

902
00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:24.439
(Groans loudly)

903
00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:27.609
(Both yelling)

904
00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:29.319
- (Spear vibrating)
- (Grunts)

905
00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:32.155
(Namora speaking)

906
00:50:36.326 --> 00:50:37.327
(Grunts)

907
00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:45.752
Shuri: (Muffled) Okoye!

908
00:50:47.253 --> 00:50:48.254
(In English) Wait!

909
00:50:48.338 --> 00:50:49.714
Griot: Activating
interpretation.

910
00:50:49.797 --> 00:50:51.025
- I'm shuri.
- (Griot translating)

911
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:52.342
Princess of wakanda.

912
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.594
I demand that you take me
to namor.

913
00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:56.846
Do not bring harm to this girl.

914
00:50:57.847 --> 00:50:59.474
(Speaking other language)

915
00:50:59.557 --> 00:51:01.643
Griot: (Translating)
Do we take them both alive?

916
00:51:01.935 --> 00:51:04.229
- (Speaking other language)
- Griot: Yes, attuma.

917
00:51:04.562 --> 00:51:05.855
(Ax clangs)

918
00:51:06.314 --> 00:51:08.316
(Suspenseful music playing)

919
00:51:09.817 --> 00:51:11.152
(Mask hisses)

920
00:51:16.324 --> 00:51:17.450
(Mask hisses)

921
00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:20.453
(Speaking other language)

922
00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:21.663
Griot: Breathe.

923
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:23.289
(Inhales deeply)

924
00:51:24.916 --> 00:51:26.960
(Coughing and gasping)

925
00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:31.589
Shun!

926
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.638
(Screaming)

927
00:51:42.809 --> 00:51:44.894
- (Indistinct radio chatter)
- (Exhales)

928
00:51:50.024 --> 00:51:52.694
Ross, from the agency.
You got any witnesses?

929
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.071
None. But we think
it was the wakandans.

930
00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:56.447
Excuse me?

931
00:51:56.531 --> 00:51:57.716
Our field office
got a tip from Langley

932
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.741
that they were coming.

933
00:51:58.908 --> 00:52:00.702
Right. Who made that call?

934
00:52:01.744 --> 00:52:03.344
- She did.
- Agent: Director de fontaine.

935
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.916
Director de fontaine.

936
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.001
Really?

937
00:52:08.084 --> 00:52:09.085
Well...

938
00:52:10.086 --> 00:52:11.963
Uh, agent thinks
it was the wakandans.

939
00:52:12.505 --> 00:52:14.007
Yeah, we've been
on every one of them

940
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.150
since they took out our ship.

941
00:52:15.174 --> 00:52:16.592
That's why I wanted you here.

942
00:52:17.677 --> 00:52:18.761
You're lookin' good.

943
00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:20.430
Oh. Well, I try.

944
00:52:20.596 --> 00:52:22.098
De fontaine: You put
that home gym in?

945
00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:23.182
Ross: Yeah. Last year.

946
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:26.060
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your peloton.

947
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:27.812
Howdy.

948
00:52:27.895 --> 00:52:29.707
- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.

949
00:52:29.731 --> 00:52:31.899
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

950
00:52:32.066 --> 00:52:34.235
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

951
00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:35.799
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

952
00:52:36.154 --> 00:52:37.739
Um, we think it was a car crash,

953
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:39.657
but we're having trouble
finding the cars.

954
00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:40.843
De fontaine: What do you mean?

955
00:52:40.867 --> 00:52:42.219
It was just like this
when you found it?

956
00:52:42.243 --> 00:52:43.929
Special agent: Yes.
We think someone involved

957
00:52:43.953 --> 00:52:44.954
got rid of the vehicles.

958
00:52:45.038 --> 00:52:46.265
De fontaine:
Got rid of them how?

959
00:52:46.289 --> 00:52:47.891
Special agent: They dumped
them into the river.

960
00:52:47.915 --> 00:52:49.155
De fontaine: You're kidding me.

961
00:52:50.168 --> 00:52:51.753
It's got an mit sticker on it.

962
00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:54.297
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

963
00:52:54.464 --> 00:52:56.549
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

964
00:52:56.716 --> 00:52:58.384
Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?

965
00:52:58.468 --> 00:53:00.678
Ross: (Hesitates)
It's an eight-hour drive.

966
00:53:00.762 --> 00:53:02.281
De fontaine: Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

967
00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:04.682
Actually, wouldn't mind...
(Clears throat)

968
00:53:04.766 --> 00:53:06.934
Apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said

969
00:53:07.018 --> 00:53:08.061
during our marriage.

970
00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:12.690
Okoye: They were blue.

971
00:53:13.733 --> 00:53:15.568
And they had
superhuman strength.

972
00:53:16.486 --> 00:53:19.322
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

973
00:53:20.198 --> 00:53:21.866
I struck down three of them

974
00:53:21.949 --> 00:53:23.429
with blows
that should've killed them,

975
00:53:23.493 --> 00:53:25.203
but they Rose again.

976
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:28.623
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our Princess.

977
00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:41.636
Ramonda: Okoye,

978
00:53:42.011 --> 00:53:44.430
you will be
stripped of your rank

979
00:53:44.514 --> 00:53:46.516
as general of wakanda's armies

980
00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:49.560
and your status as dora milaje.

981
00:53:54.357 --> 00:53:55.525
(In xhosa)

982
00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:58.903
(In English) You may.

983
00:53:59.404 --> 00:54:00.863
(In xhosa)

984
00:54:02.865 --> 00:54:04.325
(In English)
I have given everything.

985
00:54:05.284 --> 00:54:09.080
Let me die saving my country
and that throne.

986
00:54:09.247 --> 00:54:10.623
(In xhosa)

987
00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:13.209
(In English) Allow me
to make this right.

988
00:54:13.292 --> 00:54:14.585
"Make it right"?

989
00:54:15.128 --> 00:54:16.129
(Cries)

990
00:54:16.212 --> 00:54:19.340
I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.

991
00:54:19.507 --> 00:54:22.760
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

992
00:54:22.844 --> 00:54:24.178
M'Baku: Mmm.

993
00:54:24.846 --> 00:54:29.225
She raised a spear against
her own husband for wakanda.

994
00:54:29.392 --> 00:54:31.936
Where is her
treacherous husband now

995
00:54:32.103 --> 00:54:36.399
but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...

996
00:54:37.692 --> 00:54:39.569
Is with the ancestors.

997
00:54:39.652 --> 00:54:44.449
I am queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

998
00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:47.827
and my entire family is gone!

999
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:51.456
Have I not given everything?

1000
00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:02.550
On your feet, general.

1001
00:55:08.723 --> 00:55:10.933
I stood by you

1002
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.729
after killmonger
took the throne,

1003
00:55:14.896 --> 00:55:18.483
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

1004
00:55:18.649 --> 00:55:22.278
while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.

1005
00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:25.072
And I warned you

1006
00:55:25.156 --> 00:55:28.034
about taking my daughter
on this mission,

1007
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:30.119
and you lost her.

1008
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:32.371
So, today,

1009
00:55:33.289 --> 00:55:35.458
I am done. (Breath shudders)

1010
00:55:36.292 --> 00:55:38.294
(Grave music playing)

1011
00:55:45.009 --> 00:55:47.386
(Sighs deeply)

1012
00:56:02.944 --> 00:56:04.779
(Door whirs)

1013
00:56:21.546 --> 00:56:24.090
Are you here, griot?

1014
00:56:25.424 --> 00:56:26.676
Griot: Yes, my queen.

1015
00:56:27.718 --> 00:56:31.097
Were you with shuri
when she was abducted?

1016
00:56:31.264 --> 00:56:32.557
Griot: I was.

1017
00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:35.476
Are you able to track
her kimoyo beads?

1018
00:56:35.643 --> 00:56:38.062
De fontaine: Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.

1019
00:56:38.145 --> 00:56:40.231
Those wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

1020
00:56:40.314 --> 00:56:41.315
Ross: Hmm.

1021
00:56:41.399 --> 00:56:43.199
I can't see how
they figured out who built it.

1022
00:56:43.234 --> 00:56:45.653
That information
is highly classified.

1023
00:56:46.445 --> 00:56:48.030
(Device chimes softly)

1024
00:56:48.906 --> 00:56:49.907
What is that?

1025
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:51.409
- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

1026
00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.829
Uh, director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

1027
00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:56.122
It's enough with the titles.

1028
00:56:56.205 --> 00:56:57.373
Just take it. I don't care.

1029
00:56:57.456 --> 00:56:58.666
Hey, honey sweetheart.

1030
00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:00.376
Ooh. (Chuckles)

1031
00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:03.004
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

1032
00:57:03.713 --> 00:57:05.089
Actually, she's leaving.

1033
00:57:05.256 --> 00:57:06.257
All right.

1034
00:57:06.424 --> 00:57:08.884
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

1035
00:57:11.095 --> 00:57:12.096
(Car starts)

1036
00:57:14.599 --> 00:57:16.183
(Kimoyo beads chirp)

1037
00:57:16.267 --> 00:57:17.768
Everett Ross.

1038
00:57:17.935 --> 00:57:19.061
Queen ramonda?

1039
00:57:19.228 --> 00:57:21.188
What are you doing
with shuri's kimoyo beads?

1040
00:57:21.272 --> 00:57:23.232
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

1041
00:57:23.316 --> 00:57:25.568
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

1042
00:57:26.611 --> 00:57:27.737
Do you have the student?

1043
00:57:28.613 --> 00:57:31.574
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

1044
00:57:32.491 --> 00:57:33.951
What? Taken by who?

1045
00:57:35.536 --> 00:57:37.580
My agency assumes it was you.

1046
00:57:37.663 --> 00:57:39.707
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact

1047
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.043
that I pointed shuri and okoye
in the right direction.

1048
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:43.919
Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.

1049
00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:45.921
But I can't if I don't know
what's going on.

1050
00:57:46.088 --> 00:57:48.799
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

1051
00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:51.177
A country
that's already on our radar?

1052
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.261
Or you mean someone else?

1053
00:57:52.345 --> 00:57:54.347
Ramonda: That is all I can say for now.

1054
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:55.514
Please,

1055
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:58.601
alert me if your government
decides to act

1056
00:57:58.684 --> 00:58:00.269
on their suspicions.

1057
00:58:00.353 --> 00:58:01.520
Yeah. Sure.

1058
00:58:02.104 --> 00:58:06.108
Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

1059
00:58:06.275 --> 00:58:08.069
I owe shuri my life.

1060
00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:12.740
Griot, did shuri have
her earrings with her?

1061
00:58:12.907 --> 00:58:15.451
Griot: I lost track of them
in the north Atlantic,

1062
00:58:15.618 --> 00:58:18.788
but the people who took her
spoke yucatec Mayan.

1063
00:58:28.923 --> 00:58:30.203
(Ramonda speaking
Haitian creole)

1064
00:59:07.044 --> 00:59:08.921
- Hmm?
- Girl 1: Oui, miss nakia.

1065
00:59:11.507 --> 00:59:12.508
(Girl 1 speaking)

1066
00:59:12.591 --> 00:59:13.592
(Girl 2 speaking)

1067
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:20.641
(In English) Queen mother.

1068
00:59:22.476 --> 00:59:24.770
Everything is a lesson here
for the children.

1069
00:59:24.937 --> 00:59:27.940
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,

1070
00:59:28.107 --> 00:59:30.401
and they grow
everything we eat here.

1071
00:59:30.568 --> 00:59:33.195
I recognize
some of the concepts here.

1072
00:59:33.362 --> 00:59:35.322
But you are using
different material.

1073
00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:38.826
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

1074
00:59:40.828 --> 00:59:44.165
You were missed
at t'challa's funeral.

1075
00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:57.136
(Quietly) Queen mother.

1076
00:59:57.303 --> 01:00:00.264
Ramonda: It's been six years
since you left us.

1077
01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:03.601
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

1078
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.855
I was afraid

1079
01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:12.526
of how final
the funeral would be.

1080
01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.654
Nakia, daughter of yaa,

1081
01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:20.826
wherever you go,
you are still wakandan,

1082
01:00:20.993 --> 01:00:24.622
and you know
death is not the end.

1083
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.003
(In xhosa)

1084
01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.510
(In English)
How is everyone at home?

1085
01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:40.012
Shuri has been taken.

1086
01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:41.722
What?

1087
01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.142
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

1088
01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:46.852
(In xhosa)

1089
01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.955
(In English)
I was a different person then.

1090
01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.024
I need someone who can find
where she is being held,

1091
01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:55.236
and rescue her,
without being seen.

1092
01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:58.447
Who on earth would risk war
with wakanda?

1093
01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:01.909
Riri: Oh, my god. (Gasping)

1094
01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.285
Shuri: Okay, breathe. Breathe.

1095
01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:04.829
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

1096
01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:05.996
Where the hell are we?

1097
01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.290
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

1098
01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:09.375
Oh, my god!

1099
01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:11.502
(Gasps) What is that?

1100
01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:14.421
Shuri: Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

1101
01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:16.423
- (Riri gasps heavily)
- Shuri: Just calm down.

1102
01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:18.717
Okay, is there, like,
a new black panther

1103
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:20.241
that you can call
to come and get us?

1104
01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.221
Why not?

1105
01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:24.098
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

1106
01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:26.433
The black panther is gone.

1107
01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:28.245
So y'all stopped
having black panthers

1108
01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:29.270
when I get kidnapped?

1109
01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:31.772
(Mysterious music plays)

1110
01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:35.776
(In Mayan)

1111
01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.535
(In English)
Do you understand her?

1112
01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.203
Not completely.

1113
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:49.498
Nuh-uh.

1114
01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:52.001
That is some supervillain shit
right there.

1115
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.502
That's in every movie.

1116
01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:54.920
Princess Leia.

1117
01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:56.367
Belle from beauty and the beast.

1118
01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:59.049
That white chick
from Indiana Jones.

1119
01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:00.259
It's fine.

1120
01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.887
You should see what I have
to wear at warrior falls.

1121
01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:05.973
(Mysterious music continues)

1122
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.311
(In Mayan)

1123
01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:12.730
(In English, hesitates) Wait.

1124
01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:15.274
You're not leaving me in here,
are you?

1125
01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:16.817
I'm coming back.

1126
01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:18.694
I'm coming back.

1127
01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:20.779
Stay calm.

1128
01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:29.163
(In Mayan)

1129
01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:31.999
(Chuckles nervously)

1130
01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:35.169
(Cryptic music playing)

1131
01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:39.965
(Indistinct chatter)

1132
01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:42.176
(Goats bleating)

1133
01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:45.054
(In Spanish)

1134
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:15.876
(In Mayan)

1135
01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.838
(Cryptic music continues)

1136
01:03:28.514 --> 01:03:30.015
(In Spanish)

1137
01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.808
(Eerie music playing)

1138
01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.452
(In English) Princess.

1139
01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:32.619
Welcome.

1140
01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.041
Please, feel free.

1141
01:04:44.298 --> 01:04:45.591
This is beautiful.

1142
01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:48.177
That was my mother's.

1143
01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.773
These are all
mesoamerican artifacts.

1144
01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.109
Most likely 16th century.

1145
01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.529
Have you been alive since then?

1146
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:11.033
Your mother was human.

1147
01:05:12.493 --> 01:05:13.494
She was.

1148
01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.871
Then she became something else.

1149
01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:18.082
- How?
- "How?"

1150
01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:21.126
"How" is never
as important as "why."

1151
01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:32.304
(Eerie music continues)

1152
01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:33.847
Namor: My mother and her village

1153
01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:35.516
were driven from their farms

1154
01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:39.436
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

1155
01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.481
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

1156
01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:45.984
Facing starvation,

1157
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.986
war, and disease,

1158
01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.239
my people turned to chaac...

1159
01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:53.784
Our god of rain and abundance.

1160
01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:58.831
Chaac gave our shaman
a vision...

1161
01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:01.583
- (Gasps)
- A way to save his people.

1162
01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.919
(Arboles bajo El mar playing)

1163
01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:09.967
Namor: Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.

1164
01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.649
My mother was pregnant with me
at the time,

1165
01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:28.068
and she did not want to
ingest the plant

1166
01:06:28.235 --> 01:06:30.445
for fear
of what it may do to me.

1167
01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:32.114
(In Mayan)

1168
01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.491
(In English)
But the shaman was convincing.

1169
01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:45.002
(Shaman speaking Mayan)

1170
01:07:00.184 --> 01:07:02.728
(Arboles bajo El mar continues)

1171
01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.192
Namor: (In English)
They all fell sick.

1172
01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:09.276
(Body thuds)

1173
01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.195
And their lives,

1174
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.488
their existence there,

1175
01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:14.948
ended.

1176
01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:20.495
(All gasping for breath)

1177
01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:29.087
The plant took away
their ability to breathe air

1178
01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:33.050
but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.

1179
01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.138
They settled in the ocean,

1180
01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.934
away from war and diseases.

1181
01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:45.604
(Shaman speaking Mayan)

1182
01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:46.730
(Shaman grunts)

1183
01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:52.069
(Eerie music continues)

1184
01:07:58.367 --> 01:08:00.786
(Woman whispering blessing
in Spanish)

1185
01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:03.121
(Ritualistic rhythmic blowing)

1186
01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:13.257
(In English) My mother
gave birth to me there

1187
01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:16.802
and I became
the firstborn son of talokan.

1188
01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:19.346
The plant gave me wings
on my ankles

1189
01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:21.932
and ears
that pointed to the clouds.

1190
01:08:22.391 --> 01:08:23.642
I was a mutant.

1191
01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:27.813
I could swim in the sky
and age slower.

1192
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.482
Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.

1193
01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.318
As she grew older,

1194
01:08:34.653 --> 01:08:38.240
my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...

1195
01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:41.910
And died with a broken heart.

1196
01:08:44.663 --> 01:08:46.290
She made me promise

1197
01:08:46.373 --> 01:08:48.625
to Bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

1198
01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.675
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

1199
01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.552
- (Men shouting)
- (Whips lashing)

1200
01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.345
(Slaves groaning)

1201
01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:02.069
- (Man shouts in Spanish)
- (Woman groans)

1202
01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:05.142
(In Spanish)

1203
01:09:07.936 --> 01:09:10.105
(Eerie music playing)

1204
01:09:18.447 --> 01:09:20.282
(Music sours)

1205
01:09:24.619 --> 01:09:25.787
(Men shouting)

1206
01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.873
(Panicked screaming)

1207
01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.469
(Friar speaking)

1208
01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:45.015
(In English) A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

1209
01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.059
As he died by my hand,

1210
01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.268
he called me...

1211
01:09:48.477 --> 01:09:49.644
(In Spanish)

1212
01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:52.898
(Chuckles)

1213
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:55.901
(In English)
The child without love.

1214
01:09:56.443 --> 01:09:57.903
And I took my name from there.

1215
01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:04.993
"Namor."

1216
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.996
Because I have no love
for the surface world.

1217
01:10:09.998 --> 01:10:12.084
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1218
01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:16.630
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

1219
01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:18.382
What if we took her to wakanda?

1220
01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:20.967
Let us go.

1221
01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:23.387
I give you my word.

1222
01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.013
She will remain in my country.

1223
01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:26.681
I cannot risk that, Princess.

1224
01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.475
Then keep me instead.

1225
01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:32.062
I'd love to see your nation.

1226
01:10:33.397 --> 01:10:36.024
Well, you can't go
down there in that.

1227
01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:41.530
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

1228
01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:43.949
Your blood will become toxic

1229
01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:45.450
and the pressure of the ocean

1230
01:10:45.534 --> 01:10:47.953
will break every bone
in your body.

1231
01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:52.559
(In light tone)
Or you can wear a suit.

1232
01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.459
We have some of them. Come on.

1233
01:10:57.546 --> 01:10:58.547
Stay close.

1234
01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:03.385
(Suspenseful music playing)

1235
01:11:51.892 --> 01:11:52.893
(Yelps)

1236
01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:04.571
Shuri: Hey! Namor, wait!

1237
01:12:25.217 --> 01:12:26.885
(Breathing heavily)

1238
01:12:40.065 --> 01:12:42.275
(Whale singing)

1239
01:12:43.151 --> 01:12:45.320
(Soft music intro playing)

1240
01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:50.742
Shuri: Whoa!

01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:54.871
(Con la br/sa by foudeqush
playing)

1242
01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.793
(Gasping in awe)

(Con la Brisa by foudeqush

1244
01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:09.613
Hello.

1245
01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.412
(Con la Brisa by foudeqush
continues)

1246
01:14:38.183 --> 01:14:39.309
It's beautiful.

1247
01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.479
It's made of vibranium.

1248
01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:43.647
Namor: Yes.

1249
01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.315
In the depths of the ocean,

1250
01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:47.984
I brought the sun to my people.

1251
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:51.196
I know you wished me

1252
01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:53.531
to spare the life
of the scientist.

1253
01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:56.159
But now you see
what I have to protect.

1254
01:14:58.078 --> 01:15:00.455
(Con la Brisa by foudeqush
continues)

1255
01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:20.892
(Kimoyo beads chirp)

1256
01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:23.061
Griot: (On comms) Nakia,
your hunch was correct.

1257
01:15:23.228 --> 01:15:26.231
I have picked up a location
on shuri's kimoyo earrings.

1258
01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:33.113
(Mysterious music playing)

1259
01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.421
(Engine humming)

1260
01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:02.225
Griot: The signal is coming
from an unden/vater cavern

1261
01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:05.854
approximately 140 meters
below the surface.

1262
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:08.773
Queen mother,
I've found her signal.

1263
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.067
It's coming
from an underwater cave.

1264
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.069
If she's down there,

1265
01:16:13.153 --> 01:16:14.779
I'm sure
I'll encounter resistance.

1266
01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:17.657
How would you like me
to proceed?

1267
01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:22.954
Retrieve the Princess
by any means necessary.

1268
01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:26.332
I will attempt
to draw namor out.

1269
01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:36.509
(Breathes deeply)

1270
01:16:40.388 --> 01:16:42.390
(Suspenseful music playing)

1271
01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.911
You are the first person
from the surface

1272
01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:04.496
to come to talokan.

1273
01:17:05.497 --> 01:17:07.540
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

1274
01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:17.300
It was made with the plant
that saved talokan.

1275
01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.471
You are young, Princess.

1276
01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:25.266
When you age as I do,
you realize

1277
01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:28.186
we all lose everyone we love.

1278
01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:29.938
But when I lost my brother,

1279
01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:31.731
it just felt different.

1280
01:17:31.898 --> 01:17:33.566
He suffered in silence.

1281
01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:37.153
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

1282
01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:39.948
How does that make sense

1283
01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:44.577
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1284
01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:47.497
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

1285
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.963
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1286
01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:59.634
My ancestors would often say,

1287
01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.429
"only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1288
01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.352
I admire
what you have built here.

1289
01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:14.107
And how you've protected
your people.

1290
01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:17.944
But as Princess of wakanda,

1291
01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:20.572
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1292
01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:25.368
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

1293
01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:28.913
I'm not leaving without her.

1294
01:18:29.664 --> 01:18:33.376
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

1295
01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.756
It is no longer
about the scientist.

1296
01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.468
For centuries,
the surface nations

1297
01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:45.346
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

1298
01:18:46.014 --> 01:18:47.473
Over resources.

1299
01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:51.144
Since the day
I buried my mother,

1300
01:18:51.311 --> 01:18:52.937
I have prepared my people

1301
01:18:53.021 --> 01:18:55.148
for the time
they will come for us.

1302
01:18:55.315 --> 01:18:59.527
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

1303
01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:06.743
I need to know if wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1304
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.037
There is no in-between.

1305
01:19:11.164 --> 01:19:14.876
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1306
01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.795
and you want wakanda
to help you?

1307
01:19:18.713 --> 01:19:19.881
That's madness.

1308
01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:23.051
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder wakanda

1309
01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:24.677
if given a chance.

1310
01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.931
If we make an alliance,

1311
01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.808
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1312
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:35.605
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1313
01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:38.399
the scientist will be returned
to wakanda.

1314
01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:41.611
And if wakanda
does not accept, what then?

1315
01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.656
The scientist will die.

1316
01:19:45.657 --> 01:19:48.576
And wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1317
01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.370
An attack on my people?

1318
01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:52.163
Yes.

1319
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.707
And I want you to listen to me.

1320
01:19:54.874 --> 01:19:57.835
Wakanda cannot win a war
with talokan.

1321
01:19:59.963 --> 01:20:01.839
(Water sloshes)

1322
01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:03.216
(In Mayan)

1323
01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:11.891
(In English)
I heard you that night,

1324
01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:13.977
with your mother at the river.

1325
01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:18.022
You said you wanted
to burn the world.

1326
01:20:24.195 --> 01:20:25.697
Let us burn it together.

1327
01:20:29.951 --> 01:20:31.494
(Water sloshing)

1328
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.557
Us secretary of state:
Queen ramonda

1329
01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.250
won't sell us any vibranium.

1330
01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:39.544
And now they abducted
a young woman

1331
01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:40.878
who built the machine.

1332
01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:42.338
Yeah, with all due respect,

1333
01:20:42.422 --> 01:20:44.048
riri Williams is a child prodigy

1334
01:20:44.132 --> 01:20:46.342
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1335
01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:47.969
The wakandans
were recruiting her

1336
01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.387
as part of their
outreach program.

1337
01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:50.972
Nothing more. And then,

1338
01:20:51.139 --> 01:20:53.516
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night

1339
01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:55.685
to arrest the crown Princess

1340
01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.103
of an international superpower.

1341
01:21:00.273 --> 01:21:01.993
The president wants
to take offensive action

1342
01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:03.067
against wakanda.

1343
01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:04.402
(Cryptic music plays)

1344
01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:06.362
What type of offensive action?

1345
01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:08.614
Destabilization.

1346
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:13.119
Well, special officer Ross
is our expert.

1347
01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:15.496
So, Ross, what do you think?

1348
01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:17.165
My sources are telling me

1349
01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:18.648
that there's someone else
out there.

1350
01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.295
- Another nation?
- Ross: Could be. I don't know.

1351
01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.438
You've gotta give me enough time

1352
01:21:22.462 --> 01:21:23.605
to investigate this properly,

1353
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.757
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

1354
01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:27.759
with a country
whose military capacity

1355
01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:29.802
we can't even comprehend.

1356
01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:32.388
Director?

1357
01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:35.099
I think he's the expert.

1358
01:21:35.183 --> 01:21:38.186
I think it would be a mistake
to attack wakanda.

1359
01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:41.773
(Kimoyo beads trill softly)

1360
01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:45.985
Ramonda: (On phone) Yes?

1361
01:21:46.069 --> 01:21:47.069
We have a problem.

1362
01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.968
Is my daughter alive?

1363
01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:13.096
The Princess is alive and well.

1364
01:22:13.805 --> 01:22:16.641
She requested
to be taken to talokan.

1365
01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:19.185
She will remain there
for the time being.

1366
01:22:22.814 --> 01:22:26.067
What can I offer you
in exchange?

1367
01:22:26.484 --> 01:22:27.485
Nothing.

1368
01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.654
I beg to differ.

1369
01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:33.491
The Americans are preparing
to blame wakanda

1370
01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.119
for your attack
on their mining ship.

1371
01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.247
Return my daughter
and the scientist

1372
01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:43.000
or I will inform them
of your existence.

1373
01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.843
If you tell the Americans
about us,

1374
01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:55.513
if you try to find us,

1375
01:22:56.597 --> 01:23:00.393
or if I discover a single
wakandan ship in the ocean,

1376
01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.645
I will kill the Princess.

1377
01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:05.982
I will come to wakanda

1378
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:08.109
and iwill kill you.

1379
01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:18.494
So, what happened?

1380
01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:23.374
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

1381
01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:25.334
and asked me to help him.

1382
01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:31.257
I need to think.

1383
01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:34.093
We ain't never
gettin' out of here.

1384
01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:36.179
(Faint footsteps)

1385
01:23:37.847 --> 01:23:39.807
(Suspenseful music playing)

1386
01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:46.272
- (Gun charging)
- (Tense music plays)

1387

(Gun charging)

1389
01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:06.292
(Breathing shakily)

1390
01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:08.544
Shuri...

1391
01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:11.047
(In xhosa)

1392
01:24:11.756 --> 01:24:12.757
(Guard grunts)

1393
01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.217
(Tense music continues)

1394
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.593
(Groaning)

1395
01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:16.802
(In English) Are you okay?

1396
01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:18.971
Are you okay?

1397
01:24:19.222 --> 01:24:20.502
- Give me your beads!
- Let's go.

1398
01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.016
Give me your beads.
I can save her.

1399
01:24:22.099 --> 01:24:23.100
We have to go.

1400
01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:24.453
Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,

1401
01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:25.637
but we need to listen to her.

1402
01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:27.039
Listen, I hit her
with a Sonic round.

1403
01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:29.315
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1404
01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.275
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1405
01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:33.778
- We have to go.
- Wait!

1406
01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:35.738
(Gasping)

1407
01:24:36.781 --> 01:24:38.991

(Soft music playing)

1411
01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:18.406
Did they hurt you?

1412
01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:20.116
No. No.

1413
01:25:21.659 --> 01:25:22.868
Thank you.

1414
01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:24.870
(In xhosa)

1415
01:25:26.372 --> 01:25:27.641
- Griot.
- Griot: (In English) Yes, my queen.

1416
01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:29.709
Return us to wakanda at once.

1417

1429
01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:29.054
Man: (In English) Princess,
it is good to have you back.

1430
01:28:29.597 --> 01:28:31.390
The city has been on edge
since you left.

1431
01:28:33.476 --> 01:28:36.061
Fortify the Sonic barriers
for all waterways.

1432
01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:37.229
Princess?

1433
01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:39.148
Neka.

1434
01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:43.486
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

1435
01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:47.031
I just wanted to return these.

1436
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.409
No. Keep them.

1437
01:28:50.576 --> 01:28:52.077
Might need them soon.

1438
01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:54.997
Did you get that
from down there?

1439
01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:01.337
Is it true you saw
an underwater empire?

1440
01:29:02.588 --> 01:29:04.340
- Yes.
- Aneka: Hmm.

1441
01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:06.592
It is beautiful.

1442
01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:10.471
But these people
are dangerous, Aneka.

1443
01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:12.014
Aneka: Mm.

1444
01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.982
(Suspenseful music playing)

1445
01:29:30.658 --> 01:29:33.452
Ramonda: So, miss riri Williams,

1446
01:29:34.203 --> 01:29:36.372
what do you think of wakanda?

1447
01:29:36.539 --> 01:29:38.541
The stories just don't do
this place justice.

1448
01:29:38.624 --> 01:29:39.708
(Ramonda chuckles)

1449
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:42.711
It's great.

1450
01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:44.630
But I really
would like to go home.

1451
01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:47.675
You will need to be patient.

1452
01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:49.885
Can I at least call my mom?

1453
01:29:50.553 --> 01:29:51.720
(Inhales sharply)

1454
01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:54.098

has been brought home

1456

by the war dog nakia.

1457
01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.146
Glory to hanuman.

1458
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:02.690
Soldiers: Glory to hanuman.

1459
01:30:02.773 --> 01:30:07.319
Mm. The spy saves wakanda
once again.

1460
01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:09.363
The queen will reward her

1461
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:12.032
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1462
01:30:12.116 --> 01:30:13.909
(All laughing)

1463
01:30:14.493 --> 01:30:15.953
Okoye.

(In xhosa)

1465
01:30:21.584 --> 01:30:23.184
Okoye: (In English)
After Thanos' attack,

1466
01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:25.421
when you left
without saying a word,

1467
01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:27.214
it hurt.

1468
01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:34.597
I regret not being there
with all of you.

1469
01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:37.391
It was not easy.

1470
01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.184
He was...

1471
01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:43.689
King and black panther
to everyone.

1472
01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.525
But to me... (Breath shudders)

1473
01:30:46.609 --> 01:30:47.860
(Sighs)

1474
01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:53.991
He was everything.

1475
01:30:55.868 --> 01:30:57.828
My t'challa.

1476
01:30:59.163 --> 01:31:02.124
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

1477
01:31:02.875 --> 01:31:04.752
I had to step away

1478
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:07.296
and let myself break.

1479
01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.175
I couldn't just...

1480
01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:15.512
Keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

1481
01:31:16.347 --> 01:31:18.307
Okoye: Mm-hmm. (Sighs)

1482

(In English) Are you okay?
Are you all right?

1491
01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.594
Griot, activate the sunbird.

1492

Shuri, where are you?

1493
01:31:57.096 --> 01:31:58.555
Making my way
to the city right now.

1494
01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:00.182
Stand down! That is an order!

1495
01:32:00.349 --> 01:32:02.643
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1496
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:04.245
Ramonda: (On comms) Aneka,
do not let her leave the lab.

1497
01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:05.413
Mother, you're...
You're breaking up.

1498
01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:06.498

I just hung up on my mom.

1503
01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:13.862
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

01:40:02.414 --> 01:40:03.748
(In English) Help me!

1610
01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:05.208
Mama!

1611
01:40:05.584 --> 01:40:07.419
(Continues sobbing)

1612
01:40:08.712 --> 01:40:09.880
(In xhosa)

1613
01:40:12.716 --> 01:40:14.843
- Shuri: (In English) Mama!
- (Okoye sobbing)

1614
01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:17.137
(Somber music continues)

1615
01:40:17.971 --> 01:40:19.931
(Shuri continues sobbing)

1616
01:40:24.978 --> 01:40:27.230
(Mournful music playing)

1617
01:40:55.550 --> 01:41:00.722
Jabariland offers you
their comfort for your loss.

1618
01:41:07.354 --> 01:41:09.022
You must mourn her

1619
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:13.109
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1620
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:16.905
Do not Bury yourself
in your technology.

1621
01:41:17.072 --> 01:41:18.323
Why are you here?

1622
01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.910
I promised your brother

1623
01:41:22.077 --> 01:41:24.371
that I would provide you
with counsel

1624
01:41:24.537 --> 01:41:25.956
and protection.

1625
01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.627
But I am in need
of your advice today.

1626
01:41:34.464 --> 01:41:36.216
Your tribal elders
have approached me

1627
01:41:36.299 --> 01:41:38.093
with a proposition.

1628
01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:42.764
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp

1629
01:41:42.931 --> 01:41:44.432
in jabariland.

1630
01:41:44.599 --> 01:41:47.769
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

1631
01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:50.105
who scoffs at tradition?

1632
01:41:51.106 --> 01:41:52.148
M'Baku: Mm.

1633
01:41:54.317 --> 01:41:55.318
The world...

1634
01:41:57.237 --> 01:41:59.906
The world has taken
too much from you

1635
01:42:00.657 --> 01:42:03.910
for you to still be
considered a child.

1636
01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:08.957
It is in my people's interest
to know

1637
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.501
which way your mind is leaning.

1638
01:42:13.378 --> 01:42:15.088
The elders are desperate.

1639
01:42:16.715 --> 01:42:18.633
The city is vulnerable.

1640
01:42:20.844 --> 01:42:23.013
If you are to provide for them,

1641
01:42:24.139 --> 01:42:26.391
they will be
in great debt to you.

1642
01:42:28.476 --> 01:42:30.186
And what of your heart?

1643
01:42:33.732 --> 01:42:35.734
Which way is your heart leaning?

1644
01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:40.572
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1645
01:42:44.075 --> 01:42:45.744
My heart was buried with her.

1646
01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:00.633
(Sighs)

1647
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:21.780
(Bottle lid turning)

1648
01:43:21.863 --> 01:43:23.740
De fontaine: (Sniffs) Oh, man.

1649
01:43:24.616 --> 01:43:26.534
Yeah, your olive oil's
about to go bad.

1650
01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:27.845
What... what are you doing here?

1651
01:43:27.869 --> 01:43:30.538
I'm hungry. And...

1652
01:43:30.955 --> 01:43:32.957
Tragedy strikes
the international community.

1653
01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:34.209
Sources can now confirm

1654
01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:37.253
that queen ramonda,
daughter of lumumba, has died.

1655
01:43:37.879 --> 01:43:39.464
Western allies say
that civil conflict

1656
01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:41.591
was the likely cause
of the queen's...

1657
01:43:41.674 --> 01:43:43.259
- (TV shuts)
- (Sets down remote)

1658
01:43:45.512 --> 01:43:46.846
You have any comment?

1659
01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:48.932
(Unsettling music playing)

1660
01:43:49.015 --> 01:43:52.185
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

1661
01:43:52.394 --> 01:43:54.020
(H esitates)
What are you talking about?

1662
01:43:54.187 --> 01:43:57.690
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of wakanda.

1663
01:43:57.774 --> 01:43:58.942
(Chuckles)

1664
01:44:00.110 --> 01:44:02.278
What about the beads?

1665
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:04.572
(Scoffs) What?

1666
01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:05.740
The beads.

1667
01:44:05.907 --> 01:44:07.033
I had them bugged

1668
01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.868
before you ever even got there.

1669
01:44:09.035 --> 01:44:12.872
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

1670
01:44:12.956 --> 01:44:15.625
including that treasonous call
with the queen.

1671
01:44:15.792 --> 01:44:17.168
May she rest in peace.

1672
01:44:17.585 --> 01:44:18.878
But it's good.

1673
01:44:19.045 --> 01:44:20.088
Well, for us.

1674
01:44:20.255 --> 01:44:22.966
All right. You know what?
The wakandans saved my life.

1675
01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:25.093
- They're a good people.
- Mm-hmm.

1676
01:44:25.176 --> 01:44:27.220
You ever thought for a second

1677
01:44:27.387 --> 01:44:29.013
what they could be doing?

1678
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.598
Ever thought
what we would be doing

1679
01:44:30.682 --> 01:44:33.893
if the us was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

1680
01:44:34.144 --> 01:44:38.440
Oh, I actually dream about that.

1681
01:44:41.276 --> 01:44:42.944
Val. Val, please.

1682
01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:44.946
It's director de fontaine.

1683
01:44:47.824 --> 01:44:50.994
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1684
01:44:52.287 --> 01:44:54.747
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1685
01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:59.461
We need to find a way
to weaken namor.

1686
01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:01.796
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1687
01:45:01.963 --> 01:45:05.383
The black panther has never
failed to protect wakanda.

1688
01:45:06.134 --> 01:45:08.136
I thought
the black panther was gone.

1689
01:45:17.854 --> 01:45:19.189
My brother is dead.

1690
01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.526
But it doesn't mean
the black panther is gone.

1691
01:45:24.027 --> 01:45:26.029
(Pensive music playing)

1692
01:45:41.294 --> 01:45:42.837
Griot?

1693
01:45:43.004 --> 01:45:45.632
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

1694
01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:47.592
between our attempts at creating

1695
01:45:47.675 --> 01:45:49.385
a synthetic heart-shaped herb...

1696
01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:54.057
And the fibers
from this bracelet.

1697
01:45:54.641 --> 01:45:55.934
Griot: Yes, Princess.

1698
01:45:59.229 --> 01:46:01.981
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

1699
01:46:03.233 --> 01:46:05.485
they may share
some base-level similarities

1700
01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:06.694
that we can exploit.

1701
01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:08.154
Griot: As you wish, Princess.

1702
01:46:09.781 --> 01:46:11.783
(Alone by burna boy playing)

1703
01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:14.869
Please upload
my brother's DNA also.

1704
01:46:15.036 --> 01:46:16.162
Griot: Uploading now.

1705
01:46:32.762 --> 01:46:34.889
Who do I turn to

1706
01:46:35.515 --> 01:46:37.141
when I need saving

1707
01:46:37.809 --> 01:46:39.978
'cause you move mountain

1708
01:46:40.562 --> 01:46:42.397
I can't do the same

1709
01:46:43.231 --> 01:46:44.732
and did you think about

1710
01:46:46.442 --> 01:46:47.652
when you left us

1711
01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:49.070
why doesn't he look like them?

1712
01:46:49.237 --> 01:46:51.447
His physiology
is completely different.

1713
01:46:51.614 --> 01:46:54.284
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1714
01:46:54.784 --> 01:46:55.844
The women that were guarding us,

1715
01:46:55.868 --> 01:46:56.929
they had water over their mouths

1716
01:46:56.953 --> 01:46:58.663
and on their necks.

1717
01:46:58.746 --> 01:46:59.747
He didn't have that.

1718
01:46:59.914 --> 01:47:02.333
Several organisms
don't need gills

1719
01:47:02.417 --> 01:47:05.336
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1720
01:47:05.503 --> 01:47:07.046
It's like a jellyfish.

1721
01:47:07.213 --> 01:47:11.009
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1722
01:47:12.343 --> 01:47:13.344
It's a process called

1723
01:47:13.428 --> 01:47:14.637
- diffusion.
- Diffusion.

1724
01:47:15.054 --> 01:47:16.222
(Shurl chuckles)

1725
01:47:16.931 --> 01:47:21.436
Memories, oh, carry me go

1726
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:25.898
carry me go, oh, nowhere

1727
01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:29.902
sick and tired of it all
take me far-away

1728
01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:32.280
mr dj gbemi traba ye

1729
01:47:32.363 --> 01:47:35.033
now I no fit trust anybody

1730
01:47:35.116 --> 01:47:36.868
na e make I no fit shout

1731
01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:38.870
my body Don dey tire eh

1732
01:47:38.953 --> 01:47:41.748
every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

1733
01:47:41.914 --> 01:47:43.291
is a day wasted.

1734
01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:45.043
We must deal with namor

1735
01:47:45.126 --> 01:47:46.878
before he brings
his warriors back here.

1736
01:47:47.045 --> 01:47:49.714
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1737
01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:52.390
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

1738
01:47:52.467 --> 01:47:53.718
he jumped back into the water.

1739
01:47:53.885 --> 01:47:55.637
What if that's what
makes him strong?

1740
01:47:55.803 --> 01:47:57.722
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

1741
01:47:57.805 --> 01:47:59.349
from the water on his skin.

1742
01:47:59.515 --> 01:48:01.559
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

1743
01:48:01.643 --> 01:48:02.769
he won't be as strong.

1744
01:48:03.102 --> 01:48:04.354
Yo, that's it.

1745
01:48:04.437 --> 01:48:07.649
Griot. We need to convert
the royal Talon fighter

1746
01:48:07.732 --> 01:48:09.275
into a pervaporation chamber.

1747
01:48:09.442 --> 01:48:10.526
Is that even possible?

1748
01:48:10.693 --> 01:48:11.861
Yes.

1749
01:48:13.363 --> 01:48:15.281
You're going to help us
trap him.

1750
01:48:16.115 --> 01:48:18.117
Please show miss Williams
where she's working.

1751
01:48:18.284 --> 01:48:19.827
Woman: Right this way.

1752
01:48:19.911 --> 01:48:21.829
(Alone by burna boy continues)

1753
01:48:23.665 --> 01:48:24.666
Shuri: How old were you

1754
01:48:24.749 --> 01:48:26.167
when you built
your first machine?

1755
01:48:26.334 --> 01:48:27.418
Riri: Three.

1756
01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:31.047
My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.

1757
01:48:31.214 --> 01:48:33.675
He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.

1758
01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:39.889
So who taught you
how to do all that you do?

1759
01:48:40.223 --> 01:48:41.474
Sh u ri: My big brother.

1760
01:48:44.519 --> 01:48:47.855
Okoye: I was the tip of
the spear of wakanda's army.

1761
01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:50.441
This is not me.

1762
01:48:50.942 --> 01:48:53.111
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1763
01:48:54.195 --> 01:48:55.571
I turned in my weapon.

1764
01:48:56.197 --> 01:48:57.865
I built you a new spear as well.

1765
01:48:59.742 --> 01:49:00.743
A new one?

1766
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:01.953
Yes.

1767
01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:05.665
What is this contraption's
name anyway?

1768
01:49:05.832 --> 01:49:07.291
Shuri: The midnight angel.

1769
01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:08.918
Midnight angel?

1770
01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:10.253
(In xhosa)

1771
01:49:11.838 --> 01:49:14.048
(In English) This will even
the odds against them.

1772
01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:16.676
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1773
01:49:18.511 --> 01:49:19.721
Please.

1774
01:49:19.804 --> 01:49:22.348
My body Don dey tire eh

1775
01:49:22.432 --> 01:49:24.225
make me Mara eh

1776
01:49:24.308 --> 01:49:25.518
shuri.

1777
01:49:26.185 --> 01:49:27.353
Yes.

1778
01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:30.565
How many of these did you make?

1779
01:49:32.692 --> 01:49:34.652
Okoye: I looked for you
at the Jabari outpost.

1780
01:49:34.819 --> 01:49:36.487
I won't be forced out
of my home.

1781
01:49:36.654 --> 01:49:39.198
You have such
a rebellious spirit.

1782
01:49:39.282 --> 01:49:40.742
Why did you join the dora?

1783
01:49:41.784 --> 01:49:42.952
Why do you care?

1784
01:49:43.244 --> 01:49:45.997
As far as I can see
na the memories

1785
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.624

e no require visa

1787
01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:52.712
I still have a lot of fight
left in me.

1788
01:49:53.212 --> 01:49:56.340
Tell me, Aneka,
daughter of kyana,

1789
01:49:57.008 --> 01:49:59.218
do you still have
some fight left in you?

1790
01:49:59.385 --> 01:50:01.804
What do you have in mind?

1791
01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:05.349
My body Don dey tire eh

1792
01:50:05.808 --> 01:50:07.351
(speaking indistinctly)

1793
01:50:08.227 --> 01:50:10.062
(Speaking indistinctly)

1794
01:50:12.023 --> 01:50:13.649
(Spray hissing)

1795
01:50:13.733 --> 01:50:15.777
My body Don dey tire eh

1796
01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:18.362
make me Mara eh

1797
01:50:18.446 --> 01:50:20.948
when my whole world
is set on fire

1798
01:50:21.032 --> 01:50:23.826
don't leave me alone

1799
01:50:26.454 --> 01:50:27.455
griot,

1800
01:50:28.998 --> 01:50:30.458
what's the confidence rate?

1801
01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:33.377
Griot: 98.7%, Princess.

1802
01:50:33.753 --> 01:50:36.422
Would you like me to print
the heart-shaped herb?

1803
01:50:40.468 --> 01:50:41.719
(In xhosa)

1804
01:50:43.721 --> 01:50:46.015
(In English) Thought
you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1805
01:50:47.141 --> 01:50:48.684
I'm still wakandan, you know.

1806
01:50:55.024 --> 01:50:57.985
This is what you've been up to.

1807
01:50:58.778 --> 01:50:59.946
Yes.

1808
01:51:00.112 --> 01:51:02.031
What you have here, now,

1809
01:51:03.282 --> 01:51:07.495
is a chance to restore
wakanda's protector.

1810
01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:13.000
(Scoffs in disbelief)
It would be the greatest gift

1811
01:51:13.459 --> 01:51:15.795
since bashenga's discovery.

1812
01:51:20.925 --> 01:51:23.177
We'll soon find out. Come.

1813
01:51:26.305 --> 01:51:27.765
- Griot?
- Griot: Yes, Princess.

1814
01:51:27.849 --> 01:51:28.933
Shuri: Print it.

1815
01:51:33.104 --> 01:51:34.814
Nakia: How will we know
if it works?

1816
01:51:35.606 --> 01:51:36.858
Shuri: If it glows.

1817
01:51:43.197 --> 01:51:44.448
(Both gasp)

1818
01:51:45.992 --> 01:51:47.159
(In xhosa)

1819
01:51:48.286 --> 01:51:49.704
(Nakia laughs)

1820
01:51:51.914 --> 01:51:53.058
(In English) I mean,
shouldn't we be

1821
01:51:53.082 --> 01:51:54.375
burning incense or something?

1822
01:51:55.001 --> 01:51:56.085
Only bast knows

1823
01:51:56.168 --> 01:51:58.170
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1824
01:52:08.514 --> 01:52:10.349
Are you sure you don't want me
to Bury you?

1825
01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:14.145
Need you to have access
to my chest,

1826
01:52:14.312 --> 01:52:16.355
just in case
I go through cardiac arrest.

1827
01:52:16.939 --> 01:52:18.482
"Cardiac arrest"?

1828
01:52:19.567 --> 01:52:20.610
She's joking,

1829
01:52:21.152 --> 01:52:22.403
right?

1830
01:52:23.571 --> 01:52:25.406
- (Kimoyo beads trill)
- Right?

1831
01:52:26.908 --> 01:52:29.076
(Sighs deeply)

1832
01:52:30.369 --> 01:52:34.206
Allow this heart-shaped herb

1833
01:52:34.582 --> 01:52:37.627
to give you the strength
of the black panther

1834
01:52:38.044 --> 01:52:40.463
and take you
to the ancestral plane.

1835
01:52:44.717 --> 01:52:46.052
(In xhosa)

1836
01:52:49.805 --> 01:52:52.058
(Suspenseful music building)

1837
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:55.311
(Music stops)

1838
01:52:57.647 --> 01:52:58.981
(Nakia chants in xhosa)

1839
01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:02.193
(Nakia and riri
chanting in xhosa)

1840
01:53:02.276 --> 01:53:03.986
(Heart beating)

1841
01:53:10.284 --> 01:53:11.285
(H eartbeat stops)

1842
01:53:31.931 --> 01:53:33.432
(Panting)

1843
01:53:33.516 --> 01:53:35.851
(Low eerie music playing)

1844
01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:00.751
(In English) Mother?

1845
01:54:14.098 --> 01:54:15.349
N'jadaka.

1846
01:54:15.933 --> 01:54:17.101
Lil' cousin.

1847
01:54:17.476 --> 01:54:18.477
How?

1848
01:54:18.561 --> 01:54:21.397
How is never as important
as why, right?

1849
01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:24.442
You chose me.

1850
01:54:24.608 --> 01:54:27.486
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

1851
01:54:27.653 --> 01:54:29.321
Why did you take the herb?

1852
01:54:30.322 --> 01:54:32.283
- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.

1853
01:54:33.242 --> 01:54:35.161
You didn't believe
the ancestral plane was real,

1854
01:54:35.244 --> 01:54:36.245
did you?

1855
01:54:41.125 --> 01:54:42.376
So, why did you take it, then?

1856
01:54:44.086 --> 01:54:45.463
You don't have to lie to me.

1857
01:54:46.297 --> 01:54:47.798
So I can be strong.

1858
01:54:48.174 --> 01:54:49.675
Strong to do what?

1859
01:54:52.553 --> 01:54:53.554
See?

1860
01:54:55.097 --> 01:54:57.058
We're more alike than you think.

1861
01:54:58.976 --> 01:55:00.936
I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.

1862
01:55:01.103 --> 01:55:02.271
I'm nothing like you.

1863
01:55:03.731 --> 01:55:05.483
You took it for yourself,

1864
01:55:05.649 --> 01:55:07.193
then destroyed the rest.

1865
01:55:08.694 --> 01:55:09.904
Unworthy king,

1866
01:55:10.738 --> 01:55:12.239
afraid of being replaced.

1867
01:55:13.324 --> 01:55:14.325
Just a coward.

1868
01:55:15.576 --> 01:55:16.619
I had the courage to do

1869
01:55:16.702 --> 01:55:18.245
what was necessary
to change wakanda.

1870
01:55:19.663 --> 01:55:21.165
How many people
like your scientist

1871
01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:23.626
did wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1872
01:55:24.668 --> 01:55:25.669
Cowards.

1873
01:55:25.836 --> 01:55:28.089
That was the panthers
that came before me,

1874
01:55:29.173 --> 01:55:30.174
and before t'challa.

1875
01:55:30.257 --> 01:55:32.093
Don't mention my brother.

1876
01:55:32.426 --> 01:55:34.095
You're the reason why he's dead.

1877
01:55:34.595 --> 01:55:37.848
You burnt the herb,
left us with no protector.

1878
01:55:38.015 --> 01:55:40.267
Then namor struck
and killed my mother.

1879
01:55:40.434 --> 01:55:42.269
Their blood is on your hands.

1880
01:55:43.437 --> 01:55:44.772
That ain't on me.

1881
01:55:45.314 --> 01:55:46.690
And don't you dare

1882
01:55:46.857 --> 01:55:48.692
take that away from your mother.

1883
01:55:48.859 --> 01:55:50.444
She sacrificed her life
to protect

1884
01:55:50.528 --> 01:55:52.363
a young girl
from the lost tribe.

1885
01:55:53.739 --> 01:55:56.408
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1886
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:59.662
He would've killed that girl.

1887
01:56:00.371 --> 01:56:02.289
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1888
01:56:03.874 --> 01:56:06.544
T'challa was too noble.

1889
01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:11.048
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

1890
01:56:13.175 --> 01:56:14.844
And here you stand.

1891
01:56:20.516 --> 01:56:22.643
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

1892
01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:24.895
or take care of business...

1893
01:56:25.604 --> 01:56:26.730
Like me?

1894
01:56:28.399 --> 01:56:29.483
(Yelps)

1895
01:56:29.567 --> 01:56:30.568
Nakia: Are you okay?

1896
01:56:30.985 --> 01:56:32.653
(Gasping)

1897
01:56:32.736 --> 01:56:33.904
(In xhosa)

1898
01:56:36.448 --> 01:56:37.608
(In English) Who did you see?

1899
01:56:43.038 --> 01:56:44.039
No one.

1900
01:56:47.293 --> 01:56:48.294
(In xhosa)

1901
01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:50.337
(In English) I failed.

1902
01:56:50.504 --> 01:56:52.631
- It didn't work.
- Hey, shuri.

1903
01:56:55.759 --> 01:56:58.137
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

1904
01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.763
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1905
01:56:59.847 --> 01:57:01.682
- I re-created the herb.
- Okay.

1906
01:57:01.765 --> 01:57:03.809
I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?

1907
01:57:03.976 --> 01:57:05.519
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

1908
01:57:05.603 --> 01:57:06.729
Just relax.

1909
01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:10.941
(Grunts in frustration)

1910
01:57:13.819 --> 01:57:15.112
Both: Shit.

1911
01:57:19.450 --> 01:57:20.784
Can I get some of that too?

1912
01:57:28.209 --> 01:57:29.251
I think...

1913
01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:32.254
You're going to need a suit.

1914
01:57:35.507 --> 01:57:37.718
(Pensive music playing)

1915
01:57:51.148 --> 01:57:53.484
(Slow synth music playing)

1916
01:58:03.869 --> 01:58:05.931
Tribe elder 1: There are more
people coming from the city.

1917
01:58:05.955 --> 01:58:07.581
M'Baku: They need more space.

1918
01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:08.749
So what?

1919
01:58:09.625 --> 01:58:11.877
You are visitors.

1920
01:58:12.044 --> 01:58:15.256
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

1921
01:58:15.339 --> 01:58:16.340
(Falters)

1922
01:58:17.174 --> 01:58:18.676
(Engine humming)

1923
01:58:24.807 --> 01:58:27.017
(Slow synth music playing)

1924
01:58:40.406 --> 01:58:42.700
- (All exclaim)
- Tribe elder 2: The Princess!

1925
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:55.129
(M'Baku clears throat)

1926
01:58:57.047 --> 01:58:59.383
(Jabaris hooting)

1927
01:59:02.511 --> 01:59:04.513
(Music intensifies)

1928
01:59:04.596 --> 01:59:06.098
(Hooting continues)

1929
01:59:13.022 --> 01:59:14.315
(Hooting subsides)

1930
01:59:16.233 --> 01:59:17.526
M'Baku: She has done it!

1931
01:59:18.235 --> 01:59:21.238
- The black panther lives!
- (Jabaris ululating)

1932
01:59:21.322 --> 01:59:24.325
- (Jabaris chanting)
- (Zawavari singing in xhosa)

1933
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:30.539
(Jabaris continue chanting)

1934
01:59:39.089 --> 01:59:41.508
Namor believes
wakanda is on her knees.

1935
01:59:43.969 --> 01:59:45.429
Our queen murdered.

1936
01:59:47.931 --> 01:59:49.475
Our capital destroyed.

1937
01:59:51.143 --> 01:59:52.978
He believes
we have no protector.

1938
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:55.981
But now...

1939
01:59:57.775 --> 01:59:59.777
Now is our time to strike.

1940
01:59:59.943 --> 02:00:03.530
Elder: How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

1941
02:00:04.114 --> 02:00:05.824
We'll bring namor to us.

1942
02:00:05.991 --> 02:00:07.534
- Here, again?
- Shuri: No.

1943
02:00:07.701 --> 02:00:10.037
A distant location at sea.

1944
02:00:10.204 --> 02:00:11.622
M'Baku: All right.

1945
02:00:11.705 --> 02:00:13.165
Let's say this does work.

1946
02:00:14.458 --> 02:00:17.211
Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man

1947
02:00:17.378 --> 02:00:20.422
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the hulk...

1948
02:00:23.175 --> 02:00:25.594
Is murdering him
the right solution?

1949
02:00:26.053 --> 02:00:28.013
Tribe elder 2:
You were calling for his head

1950
02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:30.516
when his only crime
was intimidation.

1951
02:00:30.682 --> 02:00:32.476
What has changed, lord m'Baku?

1952
02:00:32.643 --> 02:00:33.852
His soldiers

1953
02:00:34.019 --> 02:00:35.729
did not call him
general or king.

1954
02:00:35.813 --> 02:00:38.482
They called him k'UK'ulkan.

1955
02:00:38.649 --> 02:00:39.858
What is that?

1956
02:00:40.025 --> 02:00:42.152
The feather serpent god.

1957
02:00:42.736 --> 02:00:43.737
What?

1958
02:00:43.821 --> 02:00:45.861
Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,

1959
02:00:45.989 --> 02:00:47.866
we do not have access to books?

1960
02:00:48.117 --> 02:00:49.618
- (Chuckles)
- Shuri: Elders,

1961
02:00:50.035 --> 02:00:51.412
with your permission,

1962
02:00:51.578 --> 02:00:55.290
I would like to talk
with lord m'Baku alone.

1963
02:00:56.667 --> 02:00:57.668
(Elders speaking xhosa)

1964
02:01:05.426 --> 02:01:06.760
(In English)
Namor's not finished.

1965
02:01:08.178 --> 02:01:11.265
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

1966
02:01:11.432 --> 02:01:13.767
Now is our opportunity
to take him.

1967
02:01:13.934 --> 02:01:16.186
- What are you afraid of?
- M'Baku: War.

1968
02:01:16.603 --> 02:01:19.940
If namor is indeed
a god to his people,

1969
02:01:20.107 --> 02:01:22.734
killing him
will risk eternal war.

1970
02:01:22.818 --> 02:01:23.986
Shuri: And so what?

1971
02:01:24.528 --> 02:01:26.864
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

1972
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:28.407
M'Baku: Of course it was.

1973
02:01:29.408 --> 02:01:33.495
Of course she was.

1974
02:01:35.497 --> 02:01:38.709
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1975
02:01:44.173 --> 02:01:45.883
And it is not what I want...

1976
02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:50.262
For my people.

1977
02:01:58.228 --> 02:02:00.522
(Somber music playing)

1978
02:02:00.606 --> 02:02:03.650
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1979
02:02:04.568 --> 02:02:06.570
Of what she would've
wanted for me.

1980
02:02:07.654 --> 02:02:09.948
Her hopes and her dreams.

1981
02:02:13.118 --> 02:02:14.620
But she's dead.

1982
02:02:15.662 --> 02:02:16.663
She's gone!

1983
02:02:18.373 --> 02:02:22.252
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

1984
02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:24.963
So, her dreams,

1985
02:02:25.130 --> 02:02:28.217
her goals, her hopes for me...

1986
02:02:31.553 --> 02:02:32.804
It doesn't exist.

1987
02:02:35.516 --> 02:02:37.059
It doesn't matter anymore.

1988
02:02:39.144 --> 02:02:42.022
What matters is what I want,

1989
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:44.900
and what I want is namor dead!

1990
02:02:48.904 --> 02:02:50.572
And you're going
to help me get it.

1995
02:03:34.283 --> 02:03:35.284
Nakia: Hi.

1996
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:36.451
Good morning.

1997
02:03:39.079 --> 02:03:40.289
If we survive this,

1998
02:03:41.957 --> 02:03:45.168
I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.

1999
02:03:48.005 --> 02:03:50.340
Here. Take my hands.

2003

(In English) Shuri, I want you
to be honest with me.

2004
02:04:01.685 --> 02:04:04.730
Who did you see
when you took the herb?

2005
02:04:09.901 --> 02:04:11.612
If you go to war for vengeance,

2006
02:04:11.695 --> 02:04:14.197
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

2007
02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:16.658
It will only grow larger,

2008
02:04:16.825 --> 02:04:18.285
and it will consume you.

2009
02:04:20.537 --> 02:04:21.913
It already has.

M'Baku: (In English)
May the ancestors save us

2146
02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:49.457
if the Princess does not hurry.

2147
02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:51.251
We may be going to join them.

2148
02:14:52.168 --> 02:14:53.253
If so, hey,

2149
02:14:53.419 --> 02:14:55.672

with us as we can.

2150

2159
02:15:31.791 --> 02:15:32.834

2166
02:15:55.064 --> 02:15:56.607
I'm not my brother.

2167
02:15:58.026 --> 02:16:00.028
Namorwill beg me for mercy

2168
02:16:00.695 --> 02:16:03.239
as I stand and watch as he dies.

2169
02:16:03.865 --> 02:16:05.533
(Gasping laboriously)

2170
02:16:06.951 --> 02:16:08.161

2191
02:18:54.118 --> 02:18:55.119

and wakanda
will protect your oceans.

2193
02:18:58.831 --> 02:19:01.083

2195
02:19:03.503 --> 02:19:05.213
and your people will live.

2196
02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:11.636
Vengeance has consumed us.

2197
02:19:12.094 --> 02:19:14.722
We cannot let it
consume our people.

2198
02:19:23.523 --> 02:19:24.732

thank you, my love.

2213
02:21:02.246 --> 02:21:04.915
Gives you way more
than you deserve

2214
02:21:07.001 --> 02:21:09.587
when the tears fall
like shooting stars

2215
02:21:10.004 --> 02:21:11.839
remember who you are

2216
02:21:12.548 --> 02:21:16.385
just look up to the sky
you'll see

2217
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:19.263
well, I pray that the universe

2218
02:21:21.432 --> 02:21:24.268
gives you way more
than you deserve

2219
02:21:24.352 --> 02:21:25.519
shuri: Yo.

2220
02:21:27.396 --> 02:21:28.606
(Riri chuckles)

2221
02:21:29.023 --> 02:21:31.150
- (Both snap fingers)
- All set to head home?

2222
02:21:31.233 --> 02:21:32.377
As long as you're sure
the police

2223
02:21:32.401 --> 02:21:33.921
won't be waiting for me
at the airport.

2224
02:21:34.028 --> 02:21:35.655
Don't worry. Took care of that.

2225
02:21:35.821 --> 02:21:37.114
But you might want to slow down

2226
02:21:37.198 --> 02:21:39.450
on your
homework-for-hire business.

2227
02:21:39.533 --> 02:21:41.911
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

2228
02:21:43.204 --> 02:21:45.182
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

2229
02:21:45.206 --> 02:21:46.207
Yes.

2230
02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:49.752
Your suit. It's a great design,

2231
02:21:50.294 --> 02:21:51.574
but can't let you leave with it.

2232
02:21:51.712 --> 02:21:52.922
It's all good.

2233
02:21:53.005 --> 02:21:54.298
Figured the least I could do

2234
02:21:54.382 --> 02:21:56.050
is help wakanda
clean up my mess.

2235
02:21:57.301 --> 02:21:58.803
I have one more thing
to show you.

2236
02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:00.221
Come.

2237
02:22:02.765 --> 02:22:04.141
(Rirl gasps)

2238
02:22:04.225 --> 02:22:07.311
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

2239
02:22:07.478 --> 02:22:08.854
but it was worth it.

2240
02:22:09.522 --> 02:22:10.523
Riri: How did you...

2241
02:22:11.857 --> 02:22:13.401
It's my dad's car.

2242
02:22:14.652 --> 02:22:16.362
We used to work on it before...

2243
02:22:16.445 --> 02:22:19.031
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

2244
02:22:19.115 --> 02:22:21.200
I'm coming back for you

2245
02:22:22.326 --> 02:22:24.203
- you sure this is her?
- Every part.

2246
02:22:24.370 --> 02:22:25.830
Have it shipped to Boston.

2247
02:22:25.996 --> 02:22:27.289
Be there before you arrive.

2248
02:22:32.837 --> 02:22:33.838
Bring it in, man.

2249
02:22:33.921 --> 02:22:35.131
(Both chuckle)

2250
02:22:37.425 --> 02:22:41.721
Griot: Panther, miss Williams'
transport has arrived.

2251
02:22:42.346 --> 02:22:43.889
Look after yourself.

2252
02:22:44.223 --> 02:22:46.642
Sure you're not trying
to slide to Chicago?

2253
02:22:46.809 --> 02:22:47.893
Catch a bulls game?

2254
02:22:49.145 --> 02:22:50.688
Sounds fun,

2255
02:22:50.771 --> 02:22:53.607
but I have something
I need to take care of.

2256
02:22:54.191 --> 02:22:56.193
(Festive music playing)

2257
02:22:56.277 --> 02:22:58.446
(Wakandans cheering
and ululating)

2258
02:23:06.245 --> 02:23:08.581
(Festive music continues)

2259
02:23:16.964 --> 02:23:18.257
(Music and cheering stop)

2260
02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:20.801
And now I present to you

2261
02:23:20.968 --> 02:23:22.136
Princess shuri,

2262
02:23:22.303 --> 02:23:23.596

(Cheering stops)

2266
02:23:42.072 --> 02:23:44.909
The black panther
sends her regards,

2267
02:23:45.701 --> 02:23:47.703
but she will not be
joining us today.

2268
02:23:48.829 --> 02:23:50.790
I, m'Baku,

2269
02:23:50.956 --> 02:23:53.501
leader of the Jabari tribe,

2270
02:23:53.667 --> 02:23:55.127

wish to challenge

2272
02:23:59.465 --> 02:24:00.633

2273
02:24:06.305 --> 02:24:07.973
(In Mayan)

2274
02:25:32.433 --> 02:25:33.827
Agent 1: (In English)
What the hell is this?

2275
02:25:33.851 --> 02:25:36.270
- Agent 2: Can we turn around?
- (Agent1 sighs)

2276
02:25:36.687 --> 02:25:38.647
Agent 1: I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

2277
02:25:40.065 --> 02:25:41.483
Why don't you go check it out?

2278
02:25:41.567 --> 02:25:42.860
Agent 2: Okay.

2279
02:25:45.654 --> 02:25:46.947
Agent 1: Yeah, this is shauver.

2280
02:25:47.364 --> 02:25:49.366
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

2281
02:25:49.533 --> 02:25:51.243
How do you want us to proceed?

2282
02:25:51.327 --> 02:25:52.786
- (Agent 2 grunts)
- What the...

2283
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:54.455

02:26:01.045 --> 02:26:03.088
(Whimsical music playing)

2287
02:26:03.422 --> 02:26:04.715
Ah! (Sighs)

2288
02:26:04.798 --> 02:26:07.134
A colonizer in chains.

2289
02:26:07.801 --> 02:26:09.845
Now I have seen everything.

2290
02:26:09.929 --> 02:26:11.055
Funny.

2291
02:26:11.805 --> 02:26:12.806

2295
02:26:45.547 --> 02:26:46.632
(Nakia speaks xhosa)

2296
02:26:46.715 --> 02:26:47.716
Shuri: (In English) Hey.

2297

(In xhosa)

2298
02:26:52.388 --> 02:26:53.806
(In English)
It's good to see you.

2299

Everything is ready.

2300
02:26:55.933 --> 02:26:57.309
Just give me one moment, eh?

2301
02:26:57.476 --> 02:26:58.811
Actually,

2302
02:26:58.978 --> 02:27:00.854
I think I should do it
on my own.

2303
02:27:02.064 --> 02:27:03.440
Of course.

2304
02:27:38.517 --> 02:27:39.935
(Fire crackling)

safe and sound

2323
02:30:01.368 --> 02:30:06.290
drowning in an endless sea

2324
02:30:06.623 --> 02:30:11.837
take some time and stay with me

2325
02:30:12.171 --> 02:30:16.508
keep me in the strength
of your arms

2326
02:30:16.592 --> 02:30:19.178
keep me safe

2327
02:30:19.261 --> 02:30:21.430
safe and sound

2328
02:30:23.056 --> 02:30:26.685
lift me up

2329
02:30:28.562 --> 02:30:32.274
hold me down

2330
02:30:33.817 --> 02:30:37.988
keep me safe

2331
02:30:39.114 --> 02:30:42.284
safe and sound

2332
02:30:44.661 --> 02:30:49.958
burning in a hopeless dream

2333
02:30:50.042 --> 02:30:55.172
hold me when you go to sleep

2334
02:30:55.255 --> 02:30:59.384
keep me safe

2335
02:30:59.468 --> 02:31:04.306
we need light we need love

2336
02:31:06.308 --> 02:31:09.436
lift me up -lift me up

2337
02:31:09.519 --> 02:31:11.772
in your arms

2338
02:31:11.855 --> 02:31:14.983
-hold me down
-i need love, I need love

2339
02:31:15.067 --> 02:31:17.152
I need love

2340
02:31:17.236 --> 02:31:22.199
keep me safe -hold me

2341
02:31:22.282 --> 02:31:25.786
we need light we need love

2342
02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:35.504
(Sniffles, exhales)

2343
02:31:38.465 --> 02:31:39.466
Nakia: Shuri,

2344
02:31:40.801 --> 02:31:42.511
can we join you now?

2345
02:31:45.597 --> 02:31:48.642
This is my son, toussaint.

2346
02:31:49.810 --> 02:31:50.811
Toussaint,

2347
02:31:51.478 --> 02:31:54.606
this is your aunty, shuri.

2348
02:32:09.371 --> 02:32:11.290
(Both laugh)

2349
02:32:17.963 --> 02:32:20.632
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

2350
02:32:20.799 --> 02:32:23.885
Away from the pressure
of the throne.

2351
02:32:25.262 --> 02:32:26.471
Your father,

2352
02:32:27.097 --> 02:32:28.849
your baba,

2353
02:32:29.016 --> 02:32:31.685
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

2354
02:32:36.356 --> 02:32:38.400
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

2355
02:32:39.234 --> 02:32:42.154
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

2356
02:32:42.863 --> 02:32:45.657
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

2357
02:32:47.409 --> 02:32:48.994
Did my mother meet him?

2358
02:32:49.077 --> 02:32:50.078
Nakia: She did.

2359
02:32:59.671 --> 02:33:00.797
It's nice to meet you.

2360
02:33:00.881 --> 02:33:02.174
Nice to meet you.

2361
02:33:02.341 --> 02:33:03.884
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

2362
02:33:04.384 --> 02:33:06.511
It holds a great history.

2363
02:33:06.678 --> 02:33:09.973
Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.

2364
02:33:10.223 --> 02:33:12.225
(Both laugh)

2365
02:33:13.268 --> 02:33:15.437
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

2366
02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:16.521
Is that true?

2367
02:33:17.773 --> 02:33:20.567
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

2368
02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:25.864
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

2369
02:33:28.825 --> 02:33:29.993
(In xhosa)

2370
02:33:30.911 --> 02:33:33.121
(In English)
My name is prince t'challa,

2371
02:33:33.205 --> 02:33:35.123
son of king t'challa.

2372
02:33:35.749 --> 02:33:37.959
(Gentle music playing)

2373
02:33:43.382 --> 02:33:44.549
(Shurl sniffles)

2374
02:33:50.097 --> 02:33:51.306
(Chuckles softly)

2375
02:34:04.611 --> 02:34:07.030
(Gentle music continues)

2376
02:34:33.390 --> 02:34:35.725
(Heroic music playing)

2377
02:34:53.952 --> 02:34:56.371
(Born again by Rihanna playing)

2378
02:35:02.377 --> 02:35:08.091
I give my heart to this place

2379
02:35:10.427 --> 02:35:16.808
I give my soul or whatever it takes

2380
02:35:16.892 --> 02:35:18.977
never run away

2381
02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:25.233
I've got enough angels to storm the gates

2382
02:35:25.317 --> 02:35:27.319
I'm not afraid

2383
02:35:27.402 --> 02:35:31.448
behold the brave

2384
02:35:31.531 --> 02:35:35.327
and I'll have it, no other way

2385
02:35:35.410 --> 02:35:41.374
I missed the emergence
and these moments of you

2386
02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:45.462
the mere reflection of me

2387
02:35:45.545 --> 02:35:49.382
that mirror can't change its view

2388
02:35:49.466 --> 02:35:52.302
so until those rivers run out

2389
02:35:52.385 --> 02:35:57.933
it runs through me wherever you are

2390
02:35:58.016 --> 02:35:59.851
I'll be there

2391
02:36:01.102 --> 02:36:04.272
we carry on

2392
02:36:06.483 --> 02:36:07.984
born again

2393
02:36:08.068 --> 02:36:12.322
I give my heart to this place

2394
02:36:12.405 --> 02:36:15.784
I give my heart to this place

2395
02:36:15.867 --> 02:36:22.165
I give my whole soul and whatever it takes

2396
02:36:22.541 --> 02:36:24.167
never run away

2397
02:36:24.292 --> 02:36:27.295
and I'd relive this

2398
02:36:27.379 --> 02:36:32.509
just to see your face again

2399
02:36:32.592 --> 02:36:38.139
I know that you'll do the same

2400
02:36:39.266 --> 02:36:40.767
born again

2401
02:36:40.850 --> 02:36:46.106
just tell me what I need to do

2402
02:36:48.984 --> 02:36:54.489
I'd die and come back
just to love you

2403
02:36:57.242 --> 02:37:03.915
just tell me I'm begging you

2404
02:37:05.458 --> 02:37:11.298
just tell me what I need to do

2405
02:37:14.342 --> 02:37:16.511
(vocalizing and chanting)

2406
02:38:24.162 --> 02:38:26.956
