I know.

8
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:01.862
I am having lots
of second thoughts.

9
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.697

Of course you are, man.

12

[Juan] I know, but
working at a desk?

I mean...

14
00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:10.538
So you guys pick out

15
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.206
a name yet, or-
You're wasting your time.

16
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.207
It's not gonna be Tony.

17
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.408
Come on, man!

18
00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.744
I mean, Tony, that
is a good-ass name.

19
00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.078
(sirens blaring)
I mean, not only you got,

20
00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.547
you got Uncle Tony here,

21
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550

Anthony Hopkins.

22
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.551
Hannibal Lecter?

23
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:24.552
[Anthony] Shit, yeah!

24
00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.719
Yeah, I don't think so.

25
00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:26.920
Well, I mean, you know he's not

26
00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.055
actually Hannibal,
though, right?

27
00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.223
I mean, ask anyone.

28
00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.724
Say, "Hey, y'all know
Anthony Hopkins?",

29
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.227
and it'll be like, "Oh,
the dude who eats people?"

30
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:34.395
(siren blaring) Shit!

31
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.564
All right, well, what

32
00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:37.398
Idiot.

33
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:39.267

the other Marc Antony.

35

[Juan] He killed
himself, didn't he?

36
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:43.904
Oh, fuck it!

37
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:44.772

39
00:01:46.474 --> 00:01:50.578

(Juan laughing)

40
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.745
No, it's Juan Junior.

41
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.581
Jeez, that's such a
lack of imagination!

42
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.583
It's my name, man,
and my dad's name.

43
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.751
Yeah, but how many Juans do
we need in the world, right?

44
00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:58.919
Just Juan.

45
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.255

Juan Three? (laughs)

47
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.625
Man, I can't believe we
have this calvary behind

48
00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.594
for such a small-time bust.

49
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.096
It's over the top,
if you ask me.

50
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.631
These guys are small-timers.

51
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.099
Gotta take out the small-timers

52
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.635
before they become
big-timers, right?

53
00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.769
[Juan] Right.

Hey, don't say that.

69
00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:57.845
It's bad luck.

70
00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.012
I still need you to
pay for the baptism.

71
00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.681
Yeah, are we done here?

72
00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:02.316
People got responsibilities,
important jobs to do.

73
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.151
Just leave it to the pros.

74
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.153

(seagulls squawking)

183
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.090
(flag clanking)

184
00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:42.129
(Italian orchestral
song continues playing)

185
00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.599
(Nick groans)

186
00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:50.638
(waves lapping)
(footsteps approaching)

187
00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:55.643
Oh, my god!

188
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.612
I don't believe it!

189
00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:00.781
[Larusso] Hi, Nick! (laughs)

190
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.950
How the hell did you find me?

191
00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:05.285
It wasn't easy, but then
again, it wasn't that difficult.

192
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.453
Permission to come aboard, sir?

193
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.622
- Permission granted.
- Yeah, thank you.

194
00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.290
- Care for a libation?
- Always!

195
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.460
(Larusso grunts)

196
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.327
Whoo!

197
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.631
So this is what retirement
in Mexico looks like?

198
00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:20.300
Yeah, it's my house, I guess.

199
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.803
(ice clattering)

200
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:23.804
I'm trying to remember,

201
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.972
was that with water, or...

202
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.173
- [Larusso] (groans)
Just a little

203
00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:27.975
ice in there, that's fine.
- All right.

204
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.677
(liquid sloshing)
- (grunts) Yeah!

205
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.978
(Nick laughs)

206
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.980
I could get used to
this very easily.

207
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.315
- Yo! (groans)
(glasses thudding)

208
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.516
Oh, salut then.
- Salut.

209
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.219
(Nick chuckles)

210
00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:42.890
It's good to see you, Nick.

211
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.192
Yeah.

212
00:08:46.694 --> 00:08:48.228
This isn't a social visit, Nick.

213
00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:53.166
I have three black warrants
I need you to execute.

214
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.202
Maybe you didn't get the hints

215
00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:57.504
because of my formal attire,

216
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.872
but I am retired.

217
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:01.909
Your country needs you.

218
00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:05.178
Oh, Francis!

219
00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.180
You don't get it, do you?

220
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:09.016
I mean, do you know
what my day is like?

221
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.518
And I'd say, pretty
much every day.

222
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.855
I get up in the
morning, I take a pee,

223
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.057
then I eat breakfast,
take a shit,

224
00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.027
possibly go into town.

225
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.030
The afternoon, I like
to grab a little siesta.

226
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.566
And then at the end of
the day, a cocktail,

227
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.535
just like the one I'm
enjoying right now.

228
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.536
And that's the way you'd like to

229
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.738
spend the rest of your days?

230
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:33.040
Well, I wouldn't
mind getting laid

231
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.374
a little bit more often,

232
00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.377
but yeah, that's pretty much it.

233
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.912
We have a mole in the agency.

234
00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:42.049
- Oh.
- By the time we

235
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.216
clear everybody
it'll be too late.

236
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.452
That's why we need you,
and we need you now.

237
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.889
I got $600,000 in this bag.

238
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.590
That's $200,000 a warrant.

239
00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:56.229
Imminent danger.

240
00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:57.898
We've got three, four days tops.

241
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.600
(folder thuds)

242
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.440
(Nick softly sighs)
(folder thuds)

243
00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:08.742
Let me get my readers.

244
00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:10.077
(Nick groans) (Larusso laughs)

245
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.245
You must really be retired?

246
00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.280
Yes, I am.

247
00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.417
(footsteps departing)
(seagulls squawking)

248
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.586
(bag clatters)

249
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.923
(footsteps clomping)

250
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.092
You folks must really
be up against the wall.

251
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.126
[Larusso] We are.

252
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.462
Yeah, it's nice!

253
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.102
(fingers tapping)

254
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.003
Bin Farri?

255
00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.639
My god, that was 25 years ago!

256
00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:40.607
What is this?

257
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.109
Well, you know,

258
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.311
after everything went down
in Miami the way it did,

259
00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:45.478
he was untouchable.

260
00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.446
Too high profile.

261
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.981
We couldn't go after him again.

262
00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:50.150
Well, he's reappeared on the
radar with something very bad.

263
00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:52.652
(Nick grunts)

264
00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.123
Nick, before you say anything,

265
00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.958
I gotta let you
know, if you say no,

266
00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.159
well, there's a good chance

267
00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:00.961
that you might be
exposed about Miami.

268
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.130
- You son of a bitch!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

269
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.464
It's not me.

270
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.332
You know I wouldn't do
something like that.

271
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.633
It's those guys.

272
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.168
They can't take a
chance on you saying no.

273
00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:09.002
That's why they sent me.

274
00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:09.970
They know we're friends.

275
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.304
Oh, some friend you are!

276
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.973
You've got a lot
of balls sayin' that.

277
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.141
Huh?

278
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.143
After everything
I did for your son?

279
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.310
The son you abandoned?

280
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.146
If that doesn't
prove our friendship,

281
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.647
I don't know what does.

282
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.815
What the hell kinda thing
is that to say to me?

283
00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.316
- That's not what I'm saying!
- Look-

284
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.484
Okay, yeah.

285
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.153
Well, don't think I'm
enjoying bein' here

286
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.520
layin' all this shit on ya!

287
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.158
Nick, I wouldn't be here

288
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.526
if this wasn't a situation
of national security.

289
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.830
(paper crinkling)

290
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:37.865
[Nick] And who's the other guy?

291
00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:39.833
Oh, that's Polat, the Turk.

292
00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.334
You take him out,

293
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.837
and, well, Bin Farri's whole
money laundering scheme

294
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:44.704
goes to hell.

295
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.207
And this guy's some character.

296
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.878
He has a large appetite
for 12-year-old girls.

297
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.847
12-year-old girls
turned prostitutes

298
00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:55.515
by Bin Farri and his people.

299
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.383
Jesus!

300
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.854
(Nick exhales loudly)

301
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:03.356
This one?
- That's Mustafar.

302
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.524
He introduced Bin Farri

303
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.860
to a number of
terrorist organizations.

304
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:09.029
We have confirmation that
they have a cargo shipment

305
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.230
comin' in to Mexico.

306
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.100
We believe it's
biological weapons.

307
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.702
Yeah.

308
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.204
This is serious.

309
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.071
Well...

310
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:20.040
Come on, buddy.

311
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:20.908
You can do this.

312
00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:23.710
(folder thuds shut)
(Nick exhales)

313
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:24.912
It'll be like old times.

314
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.548
And I'll tell you what,

315
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.050
if they ask you to do
anything after this,

316
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.885
I promise you I'll tell
'em to go fuck themselves.

317
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.253
- Oh!
- I will!

318
00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:34.221
And I'll quit.

319
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.222
- Ho-ho!
- I will!

320
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.723
I'll quit, and I'll come,

321
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.559
and, well, I'll live with
you on this floating mansion.

322
00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.794
I'll be your first mate.

323
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.763
What do you say?

324
00:12:43.797 --> 00:12:47.134
Frankie, if you do
that, remember this.

325
00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:52.072
Out at sea, I am in command.

326
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.774
Aye aye, Captain. (chuckles)

327
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.911
(phone ringing)
(indistinct chattering)

328
00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:01.414
(footsteps clomping)
(suspenseful dramatic music)

329
00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:05.752
(phone continues ringing)
(indistinct chattering)

330
00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:06.619
Hey, man.

331
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:10.924
I would encourage you to
ask for a permanent transfer

332
00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.325
to another field office.

333
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.428
I'm good.

334
00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:16.496
[Captain] You sure?

335
00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.432
Okay.
- What do you got for me?

336
00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:24.471
So San Mar was
bought five months ago.

337
00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.607
They import chandeliers from
China and all their parts.

338
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.808
They assemble them,

339
00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.113
then wholesale them to
distributors all around the country.

340
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.281
Papers are straight.

341
00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.116
They're clean as a whistle.

342
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.617
The shooter?

343
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.122
Confirmed to be Zacarias
Zapata, a.k.a. Zico.

344
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.491
He was locked up in El
Hongo, last I heard,

345
00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:47.961
but somebody must have paid
lots of money to get him out.

346
00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:49.963
(mumbles) You're telling me

347
00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:52.799
there are no bad apples
in that entire barrel?

348
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.001
Come on!

349
00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.303
No one seems to
know who Zico is.

350
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.971
They're probably lying,

351
00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:00.507
but I would, if I was
them, too, you know?

352
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.309
(suspenseful dramatic music)
(footsteps approaching)

353
00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.843
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

354
00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:06.313
What is it?

355
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.647
Polat.

356
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.815
Polat?

357
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:09.983
Yeah.

358
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:11.484
[Captain] Who the hell's Polat?

359
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.819
(groans) The manager.

360
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.321
He's the only non-Mexican there.

361
00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.855
I don't know, somethin'
just rubbed me

362
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:18.158
the wrong way about him,
so I ran his prints.

363
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.194
(keyboard clacks)
(indistinct chattering)

364
00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:23.830
(phone rings in the distance)
(footsteps pattering)

365
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:28.668
(indistinct
chattering continues)

366
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:33.706
(footsteps pattering)
(somber instrumental music)

367
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.342
I was about to come find you.

368
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.209
Come here.

369
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.012
I know.

370
00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.513
I heard it.

371
00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:41.514
What do you mean?

372
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.551
I was on the phone with him.

373
00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:46.353
[Anthony] Jesus!

374
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.687
[Carlita] I heard everything.

375
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.356
(Carlita sobbing)
- I'm so sorry.

376
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:54.394
(Carlita continues sobbing)
(somber instrumental music)

377
00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.368
(footsteps approaching)

378
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.871
(lock rattling)

379
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.706
(door creaks open)
- Two fucking hours!

380
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:08.241
(Turco speaks in Spanish)

381
00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:09.409
What? (door creaks)

382
00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:10.710
I've been waiting for two hours

383
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:11.878
to take a piss.
(door thuds shut)

384
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:12.879
(lock clanks)

385
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.547
Sorry, it's been busy here.

386
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:15.715
I didn't shoot anyone.

387
00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.717
I don't know who that guy was.

388
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.386
I never saw that person
in my entire life.

389
00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.720
Just shut the fuck up.

390
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.788
Yeah?
- Jesus!

391
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.893
So what do you do for San Mar?

392
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.962
I manage the
shipping and receiving.

393
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.598
You wanna try that again?

394
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.134
Polat?

395
00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:37.570
Polat.

396
00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.072
Who is that?

397
00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:42.742
FBI, Interpol, Europol,
Turkish Intelligence.

398
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.245
Shit, man, you got warrants
out from all of them!

399
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.247
How long you been
on the run, hmm?

400
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.748
It's been a while.

401
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.250
Money laundering,
though, that's...

402
00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.418
It's good business.

403
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.420
Until someone gets pissed off,

404
00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.289
or you get caught, like this.

405
00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.124
I get it!

406
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:59.092
I'm in shit!

407
00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.593
Okay!

408
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.629
Listen.
(phone ringing in distance)

409
00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.797
This is going to be
like Christmas for you.

410
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:09.436
Okay, I'm going to give you
exactly who you really want.

411
00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:10.803
Oh, yeah?

412
00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.972
And who do we really want?

413
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.144
You make me a deal,
(chuckles softly)

414
00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:20.480
and I will give you
Hussein Bin Farri.

415
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.119
Now who the fuck is that?

416
00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:27.620
You don't know
Hussein Bin Farri?

417
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.788
- No.
- No, we don't know.

418
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.457
Are you fucking with me?

419
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.991
Do you live in a cave?

420
00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:35.495
There is Rashida Bin Farri
at the new cultural center.

421
00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:36.796
Nice woman.

422
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.466
No, no, no, no,
that's the niece.

423
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.800
She is...

424
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:41.801
Nevermind!

425
00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.803
This guy, he's a
terrorist, okay?

426
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.672
Okay, what the fuck is
this guy talking about?

427
00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:46.839
Hey, gringo!

428
00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:48.475
You've heard of Bin Laden, yeah?

429
00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.642
Yeah.

430
00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:50.477
You think Bin Laden
was a terrorist?

431
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.478
[Anthony] Yeah.

432
00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:52.679
This guy says to Bin Laden,

433
00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.648
"Hey, Osama, get the
fuck out of my way!"

434
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.650
[Anthony] Okay.

435
00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.653
So señor, if I was you,

436
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:04.824
I would pay careful attention
to everything I have to say.

437
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.527
But first, we talk deal.

438
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.999
Then I give you everything
about the operation.

439
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.667
What operation?

440
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.035
You fucking people!

441
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.673
I will give you a
very small hint, okay?

442
00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.376
Unless you do
something to stop him,

443
00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:29.048
Bin Farri is going to level
the United States economy.

444
00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:33.052
And then any country that has
extra cash laying around, hmm?

445
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.057
Are you talking about a bomb?

446
00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.893
Better.

447
00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:43.530
They have some
fancy-schmancy machine.

448
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:46.533
It was unloading when you
guys made your freaky scene.

449
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.902
You talkin' about
that van outside?

450
00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:51.371
I don't know.

451
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.705
Those guys, they were
just unloadin' somethin'.

452
00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:53.873
They were all clean.

453
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.042
They were unloading a
chandelier or some shit.

454
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.410
- A chandelier, huh?
- Yeah.

455
00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:59.712
Can a chandelier turn
off a whole country?

456
00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.881
Because this one does!

457
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.250
What are you talking about?

458
00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:04.717
Turn off a country?

459
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.220
No more until
you make me a deal.

460
00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:10.557
As example of good
faith negotiation,

461
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.226
I will give you all the goods

462
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.094
on Bin Farri's shell companies

463
00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:17.063
where he launders his money.

464
00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.566
I just need access to my laptop.

465
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.933
This guy sounds like a snake,

466
00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.069
just willing to
give up his boss.

467
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.937
Yeah, well, under
these circumstances,

468
00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:28.241
I'm entitled to go through
a selfish phase, no?

469
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:29.442
(hand thuds desk)

470
00:18:29.476 --> 00:18:30.577
I need some water.

471
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.445
You want some water?
- Yeah.

472
00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:34.080
I still need to piss.

473
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.248
(chair clattering)

474
00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:35.948
But sure, okay,
(chair legs screeching)

475
00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:36.949
I'll take some water,

476
00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:38.918
but it has to be
sparkling water.

477
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.920
Perrier, Pellegrino,
something like that.

478
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.922
I'll send someone
to take you to piss.

479
00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.592
[Turco] I don't
trust the water here.

480
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.094
(lock rattling)

481
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.597
(camera whirring)
(indistinct chattering)

482
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.633
So Agent Vanowen...

483
00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:56.102
- [Turco's Voice On Surveillance]
Fuck, I gotta take a piss!

484
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:56.969
Come on!

485
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:58.971
What do you think?

486
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.610
I mean, shit.

487
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.811
Gotta call the FBI.

488
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.280
Hey, you guys!

489
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.616
You may wanna let the FBI
know about this, huh?!

490
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.452
This shit is going
to blow their minds!

491
00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.187
They'll give me a
better deal, huh?

492
00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:16.456
Hello?!

493
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.957
Hello?!

494
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.659
- I swear.
- Also,

495
00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.160
when you extradite me,

496
00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:23.463
and I'm sure you're going
to want to extradite me,

497
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:28.501
I want a nice suite in
a flashy boutique hotel.

498
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.637
All right, I'll call the FBI.

499
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.838
- Yeah.
- Okay?

500
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.509
Tell them I want a
total immunity agreement

501
00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:38.144
approved by my attorney.

502
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.011
He's in Texas.

503
00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:41.147
I'll give you the number.

504
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.482
Are you there?!

505
00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.483
I have to piss!

506
00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.818
Yeah, go fuck yourself!

507
00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.521
(seagulls squawking)
(water gently lapping)

508
00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:51.358
(board clatters)

509
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.029
(boards continue clattering)

510
00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:10.543
(ominous dramatic music)
(objects thudding)

511
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.883
(Anthony speaks in Spanish)

512
00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.356
(clerk speaks in Spanish)

513
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.727

music continues)

514
00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:39.406
(phone ringing)
(picture frame thuds)

515
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.109
(grunts) Vanowen.

516
00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:45.077
Yes, sir.

517
00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:50.082
(seagulls squawking)

518
00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:53.753
(license plate clattering)

519
00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:04.797
(phone ringing)

520
00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:09.969
Nick.

521
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.107
Roger that.

522
00:21:15.141 --> 00:21:16.743
Oh.

523
00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.245
You got a room number?

524
00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:22.749
(car engine rumbling)

525
00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:25.452
(children chattering
indistinctly)

526
00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:28.955
(car door clatters open)

527
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:30.923
(car door slams shut)

528
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:34.961
(people chattering indistinctly)

529
00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:39.165
(machete thuds)

530
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.471
(object clanks)

531
00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:50.610
(Nick speaks in Spanish)

532
00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.111

(vendor speaks in Spanish)

537
00:22:05.358 --> 00:22:08.628
(scoffs) All before noon?

538
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.996
Muí bien.

539
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:13.800
(Nick speaks in Spanish)

540
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.001
(Vendor and Nick both
speak in Spanish)

541
00:22:15.034 --> 00:22:15.968
Eh?

542
00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:18.337
(vendor speaks in Spanish)

543
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:20.973
No, we don't want
(speaks in Spanish).

544
00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:23.510
No, no, no, no.

545
00:22:23.543 --> 00:22:27.814
(children chattering
in the distance)

546
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.683
(liquid sloshing)

547
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:36.523
(trees rustling)
(suspenseful dramatic music)

548
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.862
(vendor speaks in Spanish)

549
00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:45.164
(machete thudding)
(Nick speaks in Spanish)

550
00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:48.668
(vendor speaks in Spanish)

551
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.202
Let's make it an even 200.

552
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:53.673
(Nick speaks in Spanish)

553
00:22:53.706 --> 00:22:54.707
(vendor speaks in Spanish)

554
00:22:54.741 --> 00:22:57.844
(Nick speaks in Spanish)

555
00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:02.882
(children yelling and
laughing in the distance)

556
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:10.690
(children laughing
and squealing)

557
00:23:10.723 --> 00:23:14.393
(suspenseful dramatic music)

558
00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:22.735
(trees rustling)

559
00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:28.708
(Captain mumbles indistinctly)
- Gracias.

560
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.409
- Hey!
- Hey, what's up?

561
00:23:30.443 --> 00:23:32.244
So the Turk wasn't lying.

562
00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:34.046
FBI got their
panties in a bunch.

563
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.081
I gotta take him to the border.

564
00:23:35.114 --> 00:23:36.082
When?

565
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:37.249
Right now.

566
00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:39.251
Well, he's technically
not been detained,

567
00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:41.721
so basically, you're
taking him for a car ride.

568
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.556
Yeah, the FBI, they'll
pick him up there.

569
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.724
Okay, I'll get you an escort.

570
00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:45.892
No, no, no, I'm good.

571
00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.560
No, you should
really take an escort

572
00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:49.061
to get him across the border.

573
00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:50.730
I don't wanna draw any more
attention than I have to.

574
00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:51.764
Okay then.

575
00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:54.400
(indistinct chattering)
(elevator bell dings)

576
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.068
(door creaking open)

577
00:23:56.102 --> 00:23:59.939
(suspenseful dramatic music)

578
00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:24.263
(horns honking in the distance)

579
00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:27.299
(golf bag clatters)

580
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:33.339
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

581
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:39.278
(golf bag clattering)

582
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:41.814
(scope thuds)

583
00:24:42.982 --> 00:24:45.117
(gun thuds)

584
00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:49.656
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

585
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:05.137
Hey, chica.

586
00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:07.473
Any chance they could
send us another girl

587
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:11.644
to work on my legs while you-
(Turco groans)

588
00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:14.313
I may not get one of
these for a while, huh?

589
00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:15.815
(Turco groans)

590
00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:18.517
(scope clicking)

591
00:25:21.688 --> 00:25:24.691
Maybe afterwards, we can
have ourselves a little

592
00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:28.527
Turkish/Mexican ménage à trois?

593
00:25:28.561 --> 00:25:30.496
(bones cracking) (Turco groans)

594
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.699
What say you, darling?

595
00:25:32.732 --> 00:25:34.500
(hand slaps)
(Turco groans loudly)

596
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:36.002
(knocking at door)

597
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:38.537
(moans) Go low, yeah.

598
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:42.341
(Turco continues moaning)
(door clatters open)

599
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:44.844
- [Anthony] (scoffs)
It's time to go, Polat.

600
00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:45.878
No! What?

601
00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:48.014
Come on!

602
00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:49.048
We gotta go.

603
00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:50.049
Why?!

604
00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:53.019
She hasn't even
done my legs yet.

605
00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:54.186
[Anthony] I don't care.

606
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.924
(suspenseful dramatic music)

607
00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:00.860
Where is my lawyer?

608
00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:02.695
He's gonna meet
you on US soil, okay?

609
00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:04.363
But we gotta leave
this hotel now, so.

610
00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.698
I'm supposed to have
two more days here, man.

611
00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:07.867
The party is over, dickhead.

612
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.035
Pack up your shit!

613
00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:10.536
Okay, okay!

614
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.071
Every party has a pooper.

615
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:19.211
(elevator bell dings)
(doors clattering)

616
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:21.547
Why you in a shit mood
all the time, huh?

617
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.883
Life is good, man.

618
00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.251
You get ulcers.

619
00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:27.219
How 'bout you and I make a deal?

620
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.221
How 'bout you drive me
to the airport instead,

621
00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:31.758
and I give you the password
for my laptop, okay?

622
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:32.759
I give you the password,

623
00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:34.060
and I will give you the location

624
00:26:34.093 --> 00:26:36.929
of the man who shot your friend.

625
00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:38.230
Come on!

626
00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:39.565
You will have all of
Bin Farri's assets.

627
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:41.400
You will get his
friends in the scene.

628
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.769
You will get Bin Farri.

629
00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.739
Tell them I had a gun on you.

630
00:26:46.773 --> 00:26:47.774
We can make it work!

631
00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:50.743
Come on, man.

632
00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:53.579
I will deposit $5
million for you

633
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.081
in any account in the world.

634
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:56.916
100% untraceable.

635
00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.785
I can do it from
your cell phone.

636
00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:02.121
Give half the money to
the widow, if you want.

637
00:27:02.154 --> 00:27:03.422
I don't care.

638
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.925
(dispatcher speaks in
Spanish over radio)

639
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:06.959
I'll make it 10 million,

640
00:27:06.993 --> 00:27:09.428
but we have to act now!

641
00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.596
Come on, man.

642
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:11.931
(elevator bell dings)

643
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:12.932
- Let's go.
(Turco speaks indistinctly)

644
00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:13.933
Let's go.
- Come on, man!

645
00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.434
Fuckin' hell, man.

646
00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.771
(indistinct chattering)
(luggage clatters)

647
00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:19.772
Hey, señor, watch it!

648
00:27:19.806 --> 00:27:20.773
Be careful!

649
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:22.441
That's a $3,000 case, man!

650
00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:23.943
Not a fucking laundry basket!
- Get in the fucking car!

651
00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.277
(bullet whooshing)
(hotel guests screaming)

652
00:27:25.311 --> 00:27:26.979
(passerby yelling)
(guests continue screaming)

653
00:27:27.013 --> 00:27:30.282
(dark ominous music)
(guests continue screaming)

654
00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:31.450
Fuck!

655
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.120
(hotel guests clamoring)

656
00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.622
(officer yells indistinctly)

657
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.791
(hotel guests clamoring)

658
00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:43.329
(dispatcher speaks
indistinctly on radio)

659
00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:45.497
(elevator bell dings)

660
00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:47.633
(elevator doors creaking)

661
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:51.637
(horns honking in the distance)

662
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.806
(groans) No!

663
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.141
Not a fucking fence!

664
00:27:55.174 --> 00:27:58.644
(dark ominous music)

665
00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.646
(Anthony grunts loudly)

666
00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:04.851
(sirens blaring in the distance)

667
00:28:07.186 --> 00:28:08.654
(tires screeching)

668
00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:13.525
(sirens continue
blaring in the distance)

669
00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:20.032
(Captain speaks in Spanish)

670
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:35.714
Vanowen.

671
00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:41.520
So his cell phone data shows
that he was at Vista Parallax,

672
00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.856
which is a higher-end
looking place.

673
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.358
He was there at least
six times this month.

674
00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:48.861
So we set up a stakeout
across the street.

675
00:28:48.895 --> 00:28:51.898
And since your witness
literally lost his mind,

676
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:54.901
I thought you might
want to stay occupied

677
00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:56.869
and fill in a hole
in the rotation.

678
00:28:56.903 --> 00:28:58.704
We have eyes on the place.

679
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.406
Okay, I'll give 'em a call.

680
00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:02.374
I already did and
you got approved.

681
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:04.210
Just as a reinforcement.

682
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:07.379
This is not a DEA
operation, okay?

683
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:08.747
Just watch the place.

684
00:29:08.781 --> 00:29:10.582
And it wasn't your
fault, Vanowen.

685
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:14.253
(phone rings in the distance)

686
00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:15.554
Live and learn.

687
00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:17.890
Next time, you take
an escort with you.

688
00:29:17.924 --> 00:29:22.761
(phone continues
ringing in the distance)

689
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:31.904

(surveillance
equipment whirring)

703
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:30.129
I'll be right back.

704
00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:31.463
I'm gonna get some audio.

705
00:30:31.497 --> 00:30:35.467
(dark dramatic music)

706
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:37.303

(indistinct chattering)

710
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:57.189
- Hello.
- Hello.

711
00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.159
(hostess speaks in Spanish)

712
00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:02.528
Just one.
- Of course.

713
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:03.395
This way, please.

714
00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:08.334
(patrons chattering
indistinctly)

715
00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.669
[Anthony] How do
I get over here?

716
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.171
[Hostess] That's
the VIP section.

717
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.540
Ahh, how do I become a VIP?

718
00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:18.344
VIPs don't need to
tell anyone they're VIPs.

719
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:20.846
(laughs) Okay.

720
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.181
[Hostess] I'll be
back to take your order.

721
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:24.683
(undercover officer
#1 speaks in Spanish)

722
00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.018

723
00:31:26.052 --> 00:31:27.853

724
00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:32.024

indistinctly)

725
00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:34.693
(surveillance
equipment whirring)

726
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:37.363
(patrons chattering
indistinctly)

727
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:40.699
(knife clomping)

728
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.701
(Mina speaks in Spanish)

729
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.036
(patrons continue chattering)

730
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.205
(Mina speaks in Spanish)

731
00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:51.077
(patrons continue
chattering indistinctly)

732
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:58.084
(trees rustling)

733
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.091
(footsteps pattering)

734
00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:07.393
(cash register dings)

735
00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:10.062
(clerk speaks in Spanish)

736
00:32:10.096 --> 00:32:12.064
(Mina speaks in Spanish)
(clerk speaks in Spanish)

737
00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:17.069
(uptempo Spanish music
plays indistinctly)

738
00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:20.472
(fridge door thuds open)

739
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:25.911
(Mina speaks in Spanish)

740
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:26.778
Sorry?

741
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.251
Shit!

742
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:35.087
(fridge door slams)

743
00:32:35.121 --> 00:32:36.122
Do I know you?

744
00:32:36.155 --> 00:32:37.923
No, you don't.

745
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:40.092
Ah, I'm pretty sure
I've seen you before.

746
00:32:40.126 --> 00:32:41.427
I'm sure you have.

747
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.929
No, the Parallax, right?

748
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:44.796
How do you know?

749
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.598
I've been there a few times.

750
00:32:46.632 --> 00:32:47.599
Seen you around.

751
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:48.634
I'm usually in the kitchen.

752
00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:49.801
Oh, Anthony.

753
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:52.471
I still don't remember you.

754
00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:54.973
Can we talk?

755
00:32:55.007 --> 00:32:57.309
Listen, I'm not used to
speed dating at the market.

756
00:32:58.477 --> 00:32:59.611
No, no, I'm not
trying to hit on you.

757
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:00.946
I was just hoping we
could talk in private,

758
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:03.782
so I don't get into trouble.

759
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:04.650
Por favor?

760
00:33:05.684 --> 00:33:06.485
Come on.

761
00:33:10.189 --> 00:33:11.790
[Mina] I have nothing
to do with the business

762
00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:14.160
or anything that goes on there.

763
00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:15.961
I just make food.

764
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:17.963
No, I know.

765
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:18.830
I know.

766
00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:20.966
So what do you want from me?

767
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.135
- What's your name?
- Mina.

768
00:33:23.169 --> 00:33:24.836
Mina, Mina, that's nice.

769
00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:28.640
I got a big favor
to ask from you.

770
00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:30.142
From me?

771
00:33:30.176 --> 00:33:32.844
Yeah, I need you to place this

772
00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:35.647
underneath the VIP
table at the Parallax.

773
00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:37.516
(scoffs) No!

774
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:39.818
Why?

775
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.553
It's for an investigation
the DEA's running.

776
00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:44.490
Are they selling drugs in there?

777
00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:46.158
Fuck!
- Maybe.

778
00:33:46.192 --> 00:33:48.527
Are you gonna be
shutting down the Parallax?

779
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.695
Why?

780
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:51.497
So I can start
looking for another job.

781
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.998
No, no, no, I...

782
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:53.832
(chuckles) Gosh.

783
00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:54.833
I don't know, okay?

784
00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.368
But I doubt the people involved

785
00:33:56.402 --> 00:33:58.170
have anything to do with
the actual business, okay?

786
00:33:58.204 --> 00:34:00.672
But there's only
one way to find out.

787
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:03.375
I mean, no one would
ever know it was you.

788
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:05.511
There's lots of cameras.

789
00:34:05.544 --> 00:34:06.845
Just stick it under the table.

790
00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:07.713
That's all.

791
00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:12.551
What's in it for me?

792
00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:15.687
Come on! (laughs)

793
00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:17.189
This'll take you
like 10 seconds.

794
00:34:17.223 --> 00:34:18.890
I don't know, that
expression on your face

795
00:34:18.924 --> 00:34:21.193
tells me this is
a buyer's market.

796
00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:23.695
Am I the buyer or the seller?

797
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:25.531
[Mina] You are the seller.

798
00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:26.698
(chuckles) Okay.

799
00:34:26.732 --> 00:34:27.733
How about this?

800
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:31.370
I do this thing for you,

801
00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:33.372
and then we get married,

802
00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:34.540
so I can get a green card,

803
00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:36.242
so I can join the CIA.

804
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.045
You wanna join the CIA?

805
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:42.881
The Culinary
Institute of America.

806
00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.250
It's in New York.

807
00:34:44.283 --> 00:34:46.885
Best cooking school in the US.

808
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.720
Wow! Okay.

809
00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:50.422
Let me think about that.

810
00:34:50.456 --> 00:34:53.058
Did not plan on getting
married anytime soon.

811
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:53.925
I'm just kidding.

812
00:34:55.261 --> 00:34:56.562
You're not even my type.

813
00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:58.230
Ouch!

814
00:34:58.264 --> 00:34:59.765
Gotta go to work now.

815
00:34:59.798 --> 00:35:03.269
(car door clatters open)

816
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:05.404
(car door slams shut)

817
00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:09.408
(footsteps pattering)

818
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:11.910
(Mina sighs softly)

819
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.078
I'll do it,

820
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.480
but you will owe me one.

821
00:35:17.783 --> 00:35:18.584
Of course.

822
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.252
Don't tell anyone.

823
00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:22.454
If I get fired, it's
gonna be your fault.

824
00:35:23.322 --> 00:35:25.090
Fair enough.

825
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:28.093
You know, when you were
talking to me back at the market,

826
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.795
before I knew you
were a law man,

827
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.664
I actually thought
it was my lucky day.

828
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.640
(car engine rumbling)

829
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.111

(cars roaring)

835
00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:15.173
[Anthony] All
right, here she goes.

(keyboard clacking)

840
00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:36.528
Hell yeah!

841
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.998
(hands slapping)

842
00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:44.870

(undercover officer

844
00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:48.507
Yeah.

845
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.342
(undercover officer
#1 speaks in Spanish)

846
00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:52.210

(men laughing)

Hey, let me get that.

(indistinct chattering)

864
00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:56.908
[Bin Farri] How are
you doing, my friend?

865
00:37:56.942 --> 00:37:58.076
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

866
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.078
Welcome to Tijuana.
- Thank you.

867
00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:03.782

(car door slams shut)

870
00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:15.927
[Bin Farri] Do
you enjoy hookahs?

871
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:18.597
[Yuri] Thank you, but
I prefer to work first.

872
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.765
[Bin Farri] Everything okay?

873
00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:22.601
[Yuri] That's why you're here.

874
00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:24.102
[Bin Farri] So
tell me, Fernando,

875
00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.771
how come you cost
me so much money

876
00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:27.473
after I pay for everything else?

877
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.108
Let me see it.

878
00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.109
Where is it?

879
00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.611
[Yuri] Do you have payment?

880
00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:34.446
[Bin Farri] Half as agreed now,

881
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.315
the rest after it's installed.

882
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:41.152
(suspenseful dramatic music)

883
00:38:45.357 --> 00:38:48.960
(zipper unzipping)

884
00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:50.629
So want a hit?

885
00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:52.130
(interposing voices)
- The machine's hardwired

886
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.800
to a local cellular network.
(electronic static hissing)

887
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:55.667
No, no!

888
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:59.805
Where the fuck are they goin'?

889
00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:01.306
(headphones clatter)

890
00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:05.043

(footsteps pattering)

895
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:29.535
Watch out there.

896
00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:35.507
(cell phone chiming)

897
00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:38.176

(undercover officer

902
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.921

(undercover officer

904
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.525

(static buzzing)
(electricity whirring)

909
00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:08.740
All right.

910
00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.381
- (speaks indistinctly)
I can't believe it.

911
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.248
It's all here.

912
00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:21.887
(Khalil speaks in Arabic)

913
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.722
Easier than take-out.

914
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:25.591
Please, try it yourself.

915
00:40:31.096 --> 00:40:34.065
(cell phone chiming)
(power grid booming)

916
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:34.900
Motherfucker!

917
00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:36.234
Come on!

(undercover officer #1
whispers in Spanish)

921
00:40:40.606 --> 00:40:42.073
[Bin Farri] It's just
like changing a TV channel.

922
00:40:42.107 --> 00:40:44.743
(electricity whirring)

923
00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:46.077

(undercover officer
#1 speaks in Spanish)

925
00:40:51.617 --> 00:40:52.918
But next time,

926
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:54.786
it could be the
entire power grid

927
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.288
on the east side of
the United States.

928
00:40:58.456 --> 00:40:59.758
[Khalil] So we're
done here then?

929
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:01.259
Congratulations.

930
00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.093
Are we still on for tomorrow?

931
00:41:02.127 --> 00:41:03.128
Of course.

932
00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:05.931
Let's eat then.

936
00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:13.104

DEA, drop the weapon!

963
00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:17.836
Drop it.

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:18.670

(car engine turns
over in the distance)

986
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.273
What happened?

987
00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:03.775
Yeah, you shouldn't be here.

988
00:44:03.809 --> 00:44:05.310
[Mina] What did you do?

989
00:44:05.343 --> 00:44:06.778
Me?! Nothin'.

990
00:44:06.812 --> 00:44:08.947
- Is this because of the-
- No, no, no, no.

991
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.281
Definitely not.

992
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:12.283
(car door slams shut)

(car engine roars)

996
00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:20.625
[Captain] Was he actually here?

997
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:21.827
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.794
No, someone knew
he'd be here, so.

999
00:44:22.828 --> 00:44:24.629
Right under our fucking noses?

1000
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:25.496
Yep.

1001
00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:28.867
Well...

1002
00:44:30.335 --> 00:44:32.337
So that's Zico, for sure.

1003
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.638
Yeah.

1004
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:35.707
And the other guy
there was Bin Farri.

1005
00:44:37.843 --> 00:44:39.644
These guys are like bodyguards,

1006
00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:42.513
and who the fuck is the cowboy?

1007
00:44:42.547 --> 00:44:44.482
The other ones, I don't
know who they are.

1008
00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:47.819
Yeah, we lost power a few times.

1009
00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:51.656
Yeah, the whole city
went dark twice last night

1010
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.158
without no reason.

1011
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.359
Wait, wait, the entire city?

1012
00:44:54.392 --> 00:44:55.693
[Captain] The entire city.

1013
00:44:58.196 --> 00:44:59.831
All right, you know what?

1014
00:44:59.865 --> 00:45:01.867
(Anthony softly groans)
(camera beeping)

1015
00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.168
The camera had a battery.

1016
00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:05.036
I bet it recorded everything.

1017
00:45:09.908 --> 00:45:11.877
(keyboard clacking)

1018
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:15.713

(surveillance feed whirring)

1021
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.721
[Captain] Fuck off!

1022
00:45:23.755 --> 00:45:24.555
(undercover officer
#1 speaks in Spanish)

1023
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:25.423
It was them.

1024
00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:28.393
Holy shit!

1025
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:31.562
Oh, this can't be good.

1026
00:45:31.596 --> 00:45:34.866
No, I mean, if you
think that's bad, I bet...

1027
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.202
Shit, man, I bet that
was just a rehearsal.

1028
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.069
Fuck!

1029
00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:41.239
Yeah.

1030
00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:48.379
(people chattering in Spanish)
(footsteps pattering)

1031
00:45:48.413 --> 00:45:52.250
(workers chatting in Spanish)

1032
00:45:58.423 --> 00:46:00.558
[Yuri] Okay, here it is.

1033
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:01.559
Where do you want it?

1034
00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.561
(workers chatting in Spanish)

1035
00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:05.563
(Yuri speaks in Spanish)

1036
00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.098
I have something to show you.

1037
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:10.435
I will transfer the
money right away.

1038
00:46:10.468 --> 00:46:12.904
I need the money
you already owed me.

1039
00:46:12.938 --> 00:46:13.905
What money?

1040
00:46:13.939 --> 00:46:15.740
Your guys showed me the money,

1041
00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:17.742
then I demonstrated
the system to you.

1042
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:19.277
Suddenly, I was being shot at.

1043
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.613
It seems that the
money is missing,

1044
00:46:22.647 --> 00:46:24.449
but don't worry, we
will make it up to you.

1045
00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:25.616
Look, I just want my money,

1046
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:26.952
and I'm out of here, okay?

1047
00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:28.954
Please follow me.

1048
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:33.624
(Yuri speaks in Spanish)

1049
00:46:33.658 --> 00:46:35.593
(door clatters open)

1050
00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:36.627
Khalil was going to
do the work here.

1051
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:38.429
Now, you must do it.

1052
00:46:38.463 --> 00:46:39.264
Me? No.

1053
00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:40.098
No fucking way!

1054
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:41.099
I made what you wanted,

1055
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:42.433
I am delivering what you wanted,

1056
00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:43.935
and I showed you that it works.

1057
00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:46.437
I did my job and I
need to be paid now.

1058
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:48.273
What can I offer you
to change your mind?

1059
00:46:48.306 --> 00:46:49.774
[Yuri] I watched my cousin
get killed because of you.

1060
00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:52.443
I'll give you three
times what we agreed.

1061
00:46:52.477 --> 00:46:53.311
$30 million?

1062
00:46:56.147 --> 00:46:57.615
As long as you give me your word

1063
00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.985
that you will stay
until the job is done,

1064
00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:03.955
I'll do it right now.

1065
00:47:03.989 --> 00:47:07.825
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1066
00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:14.165
50 million.

1067
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:16.968
50?

1068
00:47:17.002 --> 00:47:18.803
Before you fuck up
the global economy,

1069
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.371
I'd like to have some security.

1070
00:47:21.506 --> 00:47:24.842
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

1071
00:47:24.876 --> 00:47:26.978
How long will it take?

1072
00:47:27.012 --> 00:47:28.146
A day or two,

1073
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.981
plus whatever the code
takes to propagate

1074
00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:31.349
all over the internet.

1075
00:47:34.352 --> 00:47:35.486
Okay.

1076
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.354
Okay.

1077
00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:40.525

(host speaks indistinctly)

1083
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:28.073
(uptempo electronic
dance music continues)

1084
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.549
(Rashida speaks indistinctly)

1085
00:48:38.583 --> 00:48:39.550
Stunning.

1086
00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:40.718
Thank you so much for...

1087
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:41.552
You making it here

1088
00:48:41.586 --> 00:48:43.921

- Hi.

1089
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:46.391
Anthony Vanowen.

1090
00:48:46.424 --> 00:48:47.225
Rashida Bin Farri.

1091
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:48.726
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1092
00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.562
Is there somewhere we
could speak in private?

1093
00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:52.430
About what?

1094
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:55.266
- Hussein Bin Farri.
- My uncle?

1095
00:48:56.634 --> 00:48:58.303
Why don't you talk
to him yourself?

1096
00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:02.573
Actually, I'd
rather speak with you.

1097
00:49:02.607 --> 00:49:03.741
Excuse me.

1098
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.076
Are you police?

1099
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:05.943
DEA.

1100
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:08.746
DEA.

1101
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.914
Do you think my uncle,

1102
00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.250
who's funded most
of this institution,

1103
00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:14.252
is somehow involved
in illegal narcotics?

1104
00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:16.087
No, it's not about that.

1105
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:17.588
- Good evening, sir.
- Hi.

1106
00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:19.257
Hope you're enjoying yourself?

1107
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.958
- Absolutely.
- Hmmm.

1108
00:49:22.493 --> 00:49:23.961
Mina, my darling,
would you make sure

1109
00:49:23.995 --> 00:49:26.431
everyone has champagne
by the end of my speech?

1110
00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:27.265
Of course.

1111
00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.800
Excuse me.

1112
00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:31.136
[Rashida] Excuse
me, I have to go.

1113
00:49:31.169 --> 00:49:32.303
Is there any way...

1114
00:49:32.337 --> 00:49:33.604
It's very important
that we speak.

1115
00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:34.939
I have to go.

1116
00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:36.141
Call my office.

1117
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:40.978
(guests applauding)

1118
00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:49.120

1119
00:49:49.154 --> 00:49:50.788
(guests applauding)

1120
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:54.492
(Rashida speaks in Spanish)

1121
00:50:04.669 --> 00:50:07.838
(guests applauding)

1122
00:50:07.872 --> 00:50:11.542
(Rashida speaks in Spanish)

1123
00:50:34.699 --> 00:50:36.167
(security camera whirring)

1124
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:39.370
(Rashida speaks in Spanish
on surveillance footage)

1125
00:50:39.404 --> 00:50:42.173
(Bin Farri speaks in Arabic)

1126
00:50:42.207 --> 00:50:44.842
(Sadiq speaks in Arabic)

1127
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.344
Sure.

1128
00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:47.678
(Rashida speaks in Spanish
on surveillance footage)

1129
00:50:47.712 --> 00:50:49.380
That's the same guy
who tried to stop us

1130
00:50:49.414 --> 00:50:51.182
outside the Parallax.

1131
00:50:51.216 --> 00:50:53.518
[Rashida's Voice] Our
guests of honor for the night.

1132
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:54.519
The shooter?

1133
00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.020
- Has to have been.
- No.

1134
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.388
I've seen him before.

1135
00:50:58.223 --> 00:51:00.024
He's DEA.

1136
00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.892
He was outside the
San Mar warehouse.

1137
00:51:03.728 --> 00:51:05.196
(gun clatters)

1138
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.399
Did you know the DEA
had a history with San Mar

1139
00:51:08.433 --> 00:51:09.434
before we bought it?

1140
00:51:10.568 --> 00:51:11.702
No.

1141
00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:13.371
(Rashida's voice on
surveillance footage)

1142
00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:14.539
So you didn't know

1143
00:51:14.572 --> 00:51:16.574
that the San Mar
brothers smuggled drugs?

1144
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.210
No.

1145
00:51:19.244 --> 00:51:20.578
Then why is the DEA up my ass?!

1146
00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:26.584
Go do something about it.

1147
00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:30.221
Make sure it's him.

1148
00:51:30.255 --> 00:51:34.392
(guests applauding on
surveillance footage)

1149
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:35.726
That's the guy!

1150
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.264
I know it's him.

1151
00:51:39.297 --> 00:51:40.398
(uptempo electronic dance music)

1152
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:43.734
(camera shutter clicking)

1153
00:51:43.768 --> 00:51:48.773
(uptempo electronic

1154
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.244
(guests chattering indistinctly)

1155
00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:56.247
(uptempo electronic
dance music continues)

1156
00:51:56.281 --> 00:52:00.117
(guest chatters indistinctly)

1157
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:32.817
Shit!

1158
00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:37.622
(uptempo electronic
dance music continues)

1159
00:52:37.655 --> 00:52:38.489
Gracias.

1160
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.994
Are you gonna follow me again?

1161
00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:46.331
What are you doin' out here?

1162
00:52:46.364 --> 00:52:47.665
I'm done for the night.

1163
00:52:49.334 --> 00:52:50.635
You happen to see a old guy

1164
00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:53.804
come out here,
like, seconds ago?

1165
00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:55.206
You mean the guy in the Jeep?

1166
00:52:56.341 --> 00:52:57.675
[Anthony] Old guy?

1167
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:58.809
That's him right now.

1168
00:52:58.843 --> 00:52:59.844
He just left.

1169
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:05.015
(car engine roaring)

1170
00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:06.484
Shit!

1171
00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:07.818
Is this you?
- Mm-hmm.

1172
00:53:07.852 --> 00:53:09.320
Go ahead, get in.

1173
00:53:09.354 --> 00:53:10.488
(car door clatters open)

1174
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:12.156
We're gonna follow him.

1175
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:15.860
(car doors slam shut)

1176
00:53:15.893 --> 00:53:18.329
(car engine revving)
(tires squealing)

1177
00:53:18.363 --> 00:53:19.830
Did you catch him smoking weed

1178
00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:21.198
in the bathroom or something?

1179
00:53:21.232 --> 00:53:22.199
What? No, no!

1180
00:53:23.368 --> 00:53:24.702
[Mina] Why are we following him?

1181
00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:30.341
(car engine roaring)

1182
00:53:30.375 --> 00:53:31.509
Come on!

1183
00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:32.510
Look, look, (stammers)
You're gonna lose him.

1184
00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.178
You wanted me to follow him,

1185
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.713
I'm following him.

1186
00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.383
[Anthony] You should
turn the lights off.

1187
00:53:38.416 --> 00:53:40.184
You're getting a
little too pushy, okay?

1188
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:41.386
I don't like that.

1189
00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:43.688
Look, I'm sorry.

1190
00:53:43.721 --> 00:53:44.522
I just...

1191
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:46.190
I cannot lose him.

1192
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:47.358
[Mina] Happy?

1193
00:53:47.392 --> 00:53:48.426
I can't see anything.

1194
00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:50.861
[Anthony] Your eyes will adjust.

1195
00:53:50.895 --> 00:53:52.229
[Mina] By the
time my eyes adjust

1196
00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:54.064
we're gonna be
wrapped around a pole.

1197
00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.033
Wow. (Anthony whimpers)

1198
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:59.069
(guard rails clack)

1199
00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:01.906
[Mina] So now what?

1200
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.110
What did he do?
(guard rails clack)

1201
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:08.713
Okay.

1202
00:54:08.746 --> 00:54:11.215
I mean, I guess I could
tell you. (chuckles)

1203
00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:13.551
I think that guy-
No, no, no, no, no.

1204
00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:14.752
Wait, wait, wait, no.

1205
00:54:14.785 --> 00:54:16.721
I don't wanna know.
(chuckles nervously)

1206
00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:19.390
I just changed my mind,
just like right now.

1207
00:54:19.424 --> 00:54:20.591
Don't tell me anything.

1208
00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:22.226
Don't you tell me anything,

1209
00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:23.728
because I don't wanna have
to testify about anything.

1210
00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:25.229
Nevermind.

1211
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:27.765
(stammers) I'm sorry if
any of this scared you, or...

1212
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:31.436
Scared me?

1213
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.472
What is wrong with you?

1214
00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.274
Nothing.

1215
00:54:37.308 --> 00:54:38.909
It's just the way you're
lookin' at me right now

1216
00:54:38.943 --> 00:54:41.612
is making me think, I
don't know, maybe...

1217
00:54:41.646 --> 00:54:46.617
(uptempo Spanish music
plays on car radio)

1218
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:49.920
So what's next?

1219
00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:51.422
I'll help.

1220
00:54:51.456 --> 00:54:54.425
Even if it's just another
little job like the microphone,

1221
00:54:54.459 --> 00:54:55.593
that was fun.

1222
00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:57.294
Another job?

1223
00:54:57.328 --> 00:54:58.596
Another bug?

1224
00:54:58.629 --> 00:54:59.664
Secret camera?

1225
00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:01.932
In "Breaking Bad",

1226
00:55:01.966 --> 00:55:04.469
he puts that GPS
thingie by the tire.

1227
00:55:04.502 --> 00:55:06.103
I can do that.

1228
00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.605
Do you want me to put
one of those thingies

1229
00:55:07.638 --> 00:55:09.106
on the Jeep's tire?

1230
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:12.943
No, no, I don't want you
to put any thingie anywhere.

1231
00:55:12.977 --> 00:55:15.613
I just fucking tailed someone!

1232
00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:17.615
This is so cool!

1233
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:20.117
So technically
speaking, what am I,

1234
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.988
a DEA, a CI, an informant?

1235
00:55:25.022 --> 00:55:26.323
(chuckles) Listen, Mina.

1236
00:55:28.192 --> 00:55:29.960
You did me a huge favor,

1237
00:55:29.994 --> 00:55:33.330
and then you did me another
favor, and I appreciate that,

1238
00:55:33.364 --> 00:55:34.799
and I owe you one,

1239
00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.134
but there are no more jobs.

1240
00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.669
Fine!

1241
00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:42.006
So, now what?

1242
00:55:43.007 --> 00:55:43.841
Take you back?

1243
00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:48.679
How 'bout a drink?

1244
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:52.817
I know the perfect place.

1245
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.720
(car engine roars)

1246
00:55:56.854 --> 00:56:01.692
(rain pattering)
(lightning crashing)

1247
00:56:10.034 --> 00:56:11.669
[Anthony] What's that?

1248
00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:13.337
Do you care?

1249
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.172
No, I don't care.

1250
00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:20.210
(mellow Spanish music
plays on the car radio)

1251
00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.380
So what's your story?

1252
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:25.850
My story?

1253
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:26.684
Where did you grow up?

1254
00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:27.752
Fort Wayne, Indiana.

1255
00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:30.721
Raised by my grandparents.

1256
00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:32.557
How come?

1257
00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:37.394
My mom died when I was a kid.

1258
00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:42.733
My dad, he took me
to live with them.

1259
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:45.202
Sorry.

1260
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:47.071
It was a long time ago.

1261
00:56:47.104 --> 00:56:49.940
So your dad just left you there?

1262
00:56:51.576 --> 00:56:52.409
Yeah.

1263
00:56:53.578 --> 00:56:55.880
(sighs) You don't
abandon your kid.

1264
00:56:55.913 --> 00:56:57.081
You just don't.

1265
00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:03.921
When did you learn
to speak English?

1266
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:06.557
This is Tijuana.

1267
00:57:06.591 --> 00:57:07.758
Learn or starve.

1268
00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:11.395
Your Spanish is not bad.

1269
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:13.063
A little chunky.

1270
00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:14.765
- Chunky.
- But cute.

1271
00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:20.237
Thought I wasn't your type?

1272
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.438
You're not.

1273
00:57:22.306 --> 00:57:25.610
(mellow Spanish music)

1274
00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:36.253
(car engine roars
in the distance)

1275
00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:39.456
(car engine rumbling)

1276
00:57:41.626 --> 00:57:43.093
(tires squealing)

1277
00:57:43.127 --> 00:57:44.094
This is me.

1278
00:57:44.128 --> 00:57:45.630
(brakes screeching) Thank you.

1279
00:57:45.663 --> 00:57:47.097
(gearshift clanks)

1280
00:57:47.131 --> 00:57:50.267
(ominous suspenseful music)

1281
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:53.437
(car door clatters open)

1282
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.438
(car door slams shut)

1283
00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:57.942
(car engine roars)

1284
00:57:57.975 --> 00:57:58.943
(keys jingling)

1285
00:57:58.976 --> 00:58:00.277
(car alarm chirps)

1286
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.280
(car door clatters open)

1287
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.481
(car door slams shut)

1288
00:58:04.515 --> 00:58:09.486
(engine turns over)
(tires squealing)

1289
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:16.827
(car engine roars)

1290
00:58:28.873 --> 00:58:31.341
(ship horn blares
in the distance)

1291
00:58:31.375 --> 00:58:34.311
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1292
00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:37.982
(guard rail clacks)
(brakes squealing)

1293
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:41.151
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

1294
00:58:41.185 --> 00:58:44.354
(guard rail clatters)

1295
00:58:50.194 --> 00:58:53.397
(Jeep engine rumbling)

1296
00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:57.501
(engine turns over)

1297
00:58:57.534 --> 00:59:00.537
(car engine roars)

1298
00:59:01.906 --> 00:59:05.075
(police siren chirps)

1299
00:59:18.222 --> 00:59:21.225
(brakes squeaking)

1300
00:59:22.727 --> 00:59:26.230
(car door clatters open)

1301
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:31.068
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1302
00:59:37.241 --> 00:59:40.544
Morning, sir.
- Mornin'.

1303
00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:41.912
Driver's license, please.

1304
00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:48.753
You're a little out of your
jurisdiction, aren't ya, son?

1305
00:59:51.922 --> 00:59:53.557
Here you go.

1306
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:54.925
Where you goin'?

1307
00:59:54.959 --> 00:59:57.628
Oh, over to the mercado,
get some groceries.

1308
01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.934
Did I do something wrong?

1309
01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:06.403
I'm not a traffic cop.

1310
01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.905
DEA.

1311
01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.640
Special Agent Anthony Vanowen.

1312
01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:14.945
Hi, Dad.

1313
01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:17.581
(dark ominous music)

1314
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.415
[Nick] Have a seat.

1315
01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.483
Can I get you somethin'?

1316
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.453
[Anthony] Yeah, I'll take
a beer, if you have any?

1317
01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:24.621
Got that.

1318
01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:27.658
(fridge door thuds)

1319
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.629
(footsteps clomping)
There you go.

1320
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.008
(cap clatters)

1321
01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:46.476
What?

1322
01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.347
I don't know, I'm...

1323
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.651
I'm just lookin'
at ya, and you...

1324
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.121
You're a man.

1325
01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:57.988
You've grown up.

1326
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:00.825
You look so different.

1327
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.462
(exhales) Like, how
many years has it been?

1328
01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.330
Jesus!

1329
01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.837
I guess I owe you
an explanation.

1330
01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.206
- (chuckles sarcastically)
You think so, do you?

1331
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:21.478
You remember when you
and I drove from Cincinnati

1332
01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.147
up to Chicago to see the Cubs?

1333
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.314
The day my mom died?

1334
01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.150
Yeah, I remember that.

1335
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.853
And that man that
killed your mom

1336
01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.689
was, in fact, trying to kill me.

1337
01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.360
Wait.

1338
01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:37.862
(chuckles) No.

1339
01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:40.330
Wait, (stammers) Why would
anyone wanna kill you?

1340
01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.498
The year before,

1341
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.869
I filled his hotel room
with carbon monoxide,

1342
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:50.174
and it killed his wife, his son,

1343
01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.242
his daughter, and his father.

1344
01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:55.379
Everyone.

1345
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.685
And he wasn't even there.

1346
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.687
He was supposed to be,
but he wasn't even there.

1347
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.189
And you told me you were...

1348
01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.356
What was it?

1349
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.892
An industrial lubricant
salesman, right?

1350
01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:09.526
You traveled across the world

1351
01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.561
all the time.
- No, my job

1352
01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:15.199
was with a shadow
agency of the NSA,

1353
01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:18.568
and it was my job to
execute black warrants

1354
01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:20.704
and kill enemies of the state.

1355
01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:25.042
You just kill people
for a living, that's all.

1356
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.376
You know, when you
put it like that,

1357
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.879
it doesn't sound so
good, but it was my job.

1358
01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:29.746
It's not great.

1359
01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:33.884
I decided it was
time to let you go,

1360
01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:36.720
and I knew one
day you'd move on.

1361
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.890
You'd get married and
have kids of your own,

1362
01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.392
and I would never
get to meet them,

1363
01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.595
and that was painful for me.

1364
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.934
(exhales loudly) I
got a lot of regrets.

1365
01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:55.973
The one regret that I never
allowed myself to have

1366
01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.143
was the decision to protect you.

1367
01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:02.612
Yeah, okay.

1368
01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:07.818
Tony?

1369
01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.957
I will be here if
you wanna talk.

1370
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.126
Yeah, sure.

1371
01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:18.328
Yeah.

1372
01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.466
(footsteps departing)

1373
01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:36.981
(footsteps pattering)

1374
01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.782
(Nick clears throat)

1375
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:39.649
Tony?

1376
01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:41.986
Tony, Tony?

1377
01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:45.322
Take this.

1378
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.292
If you need to
talk, just call me.

1379
01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.693
Dial direct, one.

1380
01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.463
(keys jingling)
- Yeah, I'll call you.

1381
01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.331
Please.

1382
01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.003
(plastic bag rustling)

1383
01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:00.137
Hey! (Anthony groans)

1384
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.306
(Zico speaks in Spanish)
(Anthony grunts)

1385
01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.976
(men all grunting) No!

1386
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:07.477
(blow thuds) (Nick grunts)

1387
01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:08.678
(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1388
01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:10.981
(blow thuds) (Anthony grunts)

1389
01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:11.815
(blows continue thudding)
(male speaks indistinctly)

1390
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.317
(car engine roaring)

1391
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.486
(tires screeching)

1392
01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.687
(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1393
01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:18.989
(thug speaks in Spanish)
(Nick groans painfully)

1394
01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:21.191
(car doors slamming shut)

1395
01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:24.328
(tires squealing)
(engine revving)

1396
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.163
(Nick groans painfully)

1397
01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:28.832
(car engine roars)

1398
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:30.834
(Nick grunts)

1399
01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.202
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1400
01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:35.239
(Jeep engine roars)

1401
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:42.879
(Jeep engine continues roaring)

1402
01:04:44.048 --> 01:04:48.385
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

1403
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:55.559
(insects chirping)

1404
01:04:56.726 --> 01:05:00.564
(machine beeping and whirring)

1405
01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:06.403
(keyboard clacks)
- How much longer?

1406
01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.205
I'd say about 24 hours.

1407
01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.908
(ominous suspenseful music)

1408
01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:18.048
Okay.

1409
01:05:18.082 --> 01:05:21.385
(machine continues whirring)

1410
01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.254
(tape squeaking)

1411
01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:29.393
(tape roll thuds)

1412
01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:32.396
(bag rustling)
(Anthony softly groans)

1413
01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:36.100
(plastic bag crinkling)

1414
01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:38.102
Must be cheating on someone.

1415
01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:40.237
Two phones.
(plastic bag unzipping)

1416
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.105
I know.

1417
01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:45.275
Let me ask you, Agent Vanowen,

1418
01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.111
have we met before?

1419
01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.580
Then what is it?
(plastic bag zipping)

1420
01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:53.583
What is it that I
did to piss you off?

1421
01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:54.951
Why are you in my life?

1422
01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:59.289
How the fuck should I
know who you are, huh?

1423
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.960
You were at my
warehouse messing around.

1424
01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:06.263
Then the other night, you
tried to stop my vehicle

1425
01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.165
after somebody tried
to assassinate me!

1426
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.135
What am I to think?!

1427
01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.602
I don't know.

1428
01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.937
Why don't you ask your
trigger-happy friend here?

1429
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.440
He's the one that
killed my partner.

1430
01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.307
Yeah, I see you.

1431
01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:19.276
(blow thuds) (Anthony groans)

1432
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:22.979
(Anthony grunts painfully)

1433
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.949
What happened to Polat?

1434
01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.451
What happened?!

1435
01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.786
He put a bullet in his head!

1436
01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.455
That's not true.

1437
01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:32.622
I was there.

1438
01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.491
What did Polat tell you?

1439
01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:37.661
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1440
01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.963
What is it that you want, huh?

1441
01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.966
(Anthony speaks in Spanish)

1442
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.301
Uh-oh.

1443
01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.836
Yeah, I learned that from-
(blow thuds)

1444
01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:49.839
(Anthony grunts painfully)

1445
01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:53.310
(laughs) Wait, does that
not mean pepperoni pizza?

1446
01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:55.645
(blow thuds) (Anthony groans)

1447
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:56.646
(grunts) Know what?

1448
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.182
Now, I just wanna kill you.

1449
01:06:58.215 --> 01:07:01.651
(blow thuds) (Anthony groans)

1450
01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:04.688
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1451
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:05.989
(chair clatters)

1452
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.825
(Anthony pants heavily)

1453
01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.994
(liquid sloshing)

1454
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.162
Hey, what?!

1455
01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:14.331
(Anthony yells muffled)
(liquid sloshing)

1456
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:18.702
(Anthony continues
yelling muffled)

1457
01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.838
[Yuri] What is going on?

1458
01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:25.842
(Anthony continues
yelling muffled)

1459
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:29.213
(Anthony pants heavily)

1460
01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:33.550
Fuck you!

1461
01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:35.219
(phone ringing)

1462
01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:36.553
(Anthony pants)

1463
01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:39.723
They could be tracking him.

1464
01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:40.690
(Anthony grunts painfully)

1465
01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:44.861
(phone continues ringing)

1466
01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:47.531
(cell phone beeps on)

1467
01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:48.398
Hello?

1468
01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:53.270
It's for you.

1469
01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:56.773
[Nick] Bin Farri?

1470
01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.543
Who is this?

1471
01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.212
[Nick] Someone who
knows you very well.

1472
01:08:02.246 --> 01:08:05.415
It's been over 20
years since Miami.

1473
01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:07.751
It's you.

1474
01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.086
It all makes sense now.

1475
01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:17.093
You used this DEA agent
as bait to find me.

1476
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:18.928
Clever.

1477
01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.399
Why weren't you in Miami?

1478
01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.401
Your family was there, but no,

1479
01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.736
you were in some hotel
with your mistress.

1480
01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.738
We all have regrets.

1481
01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:31.275
How did you find
out about my son?

1482
01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:33.076
Son?

1483
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.244
Anthony!

1484
01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:35.412
Who else?

1485
01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:37.447
Anthony Vanowen is your son?

1486
01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.916
[Nick] Let him go.

1487
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.918
That's not going to happen.

1488
01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.787
(cell phone beeps off)
(phone clatters)

1489
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.624
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1490
01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:51.428
(knife shuffling)

1491
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.429
What, big man?

1492
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.097
You can't kill a DEA agent.

1493
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.465
Everyone can be killed.

1494
01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.301
Bring it.

1495
01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:01.271
Bring what? (door creaks)

1496
01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:04.140
(mop bucket clatters)
(door clanks shut)

1497
01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:06.943
(janitor speaks in Spanish)

1498
01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:08.312
(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1499
01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:10.947

1500
01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:14.351
(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1501

(Janitor speaks in Spanish)

1502
01:09:20.324 --> 01:09:23.660
(mop bucket clatters)

1503
01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:25.795
That door was
supposed to be locked!

1504
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:26.796
He's the fuckin' janitor.

1505
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.664
He has keys to everything.

1506
01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:29.132
It was locked.

1507
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.302
(electricity booming)
- What's this?

1508
01:09:32.336 --> 01:09:33.670
[Sadiq] I'll check
the main power.

1509
01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:34.971
(bodyguard speaks in Spanish)

1510
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:35.972
(gun cocks)
- Was that you, Fernando?

1511
01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.841
Of course not.

1512
01:09:37.874 --> 01:09:40.176
(weapon whooshing)
(indistinct chattering)

1513
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:41.311
(bodyguard grunts)
(skin squelching)

1514
01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:44.514

(suspenseful dramatic music)

1520

(gunshots firing)

1521
01:09:58.728 --> 01:09:59.863
(guard yells out painfully)
(rapid gunshots blasting)

1522
01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:00.830
Qué pasa? (gunshots firing)

1523
01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.367
(gunshots continue firing)

1524
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.336
(men yelling indistinctly)
(gunshots continue firing)

1525
01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:08.505
(bullet clatters)
(guard yells in Spanish)

1526
01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.508
(intense dramatic music)

1527
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.343
[Anthony] Took you long enough.

1528
01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:15.211
[Nick] Well, I'm here now.

1529
01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.683
(tape crinkling)
(knife clanking)

1530
01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.851
(knife continues clanking)
Time to go home, Son.

1531
01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:25.355
(intense dramatic music)

1532
01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:28.725
(plastic bag crinkling)

1533
01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:30.560
Come on!

1534
01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.697
(feet shuffling)

1535
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.865
(car doors slamming)

1536
01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.368
Vámonos! (tires screeching)

1537
01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:41.070
(sirens blaring)

1538
01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:50.079
(tires screeching)

1539
01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:53.750

(Captain speaks in
Spanish on police radio)

1541
01:10:55.585 --> 01:11:00.123
(officers yelling
commands in Spanish)

1542
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:07.897
[Officer] Captain?

1543
01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:11.768
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1544
01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:16.239
(dispatcher speaks
indistinctly on police radio)

1545
01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.408
(suspenseful dramatic
music continues)

1546
01:11:18.442 --> 01:11:23.447
(indistinct chattering in Spanish
continues on police radio)

1547
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.963
(officer speaks in Spanish)

1548
01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:44.468
(indistinct chatter
on police radio)

1549
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:49.473
(machine beeping and whirring)

1550
01:11:56.846 --> 01:12:00.517
(officer speaks in Spanish)

1551
01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:03.453
Is this their Wi-Fi?

1552
01:12:03.487 --> 01:12:08.157
(machine continues
beeping and whirring)

1553
01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:15.999
(car engine rumbling)

1554
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.168
(Nick chuckles)

1555
01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:21.671
(car engine roars)

1556
01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:24.140
(Anthony groans)

1557
01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.842
That was pretty amazing.

1558
01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:28.144
Nah.

1559
01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.013
That was you at
the Parallax, huh?

1560
01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:32.682
Uh-huh.

1561
01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:34.217
Pretty sure you
almost killed me there.

1562
01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:39.322
(sighs) You know, I was
just thinkin' about that.

1563
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.824
Yeah.

1564
01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.526
And it's a good
thing you told me

1565
01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:46.362
you were with the DEA,
or otherwise, who knows?

1566
01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.567
(scoffs) Jesus!

1567
01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:55.672
(car engine rumbling)

1568
01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:58.842
(horns honking in the distance)

1569
01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:02.011
(seagulls squawking)

1570
01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:05.214
(car engine rumbling)

1571
01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.352
(brakes squeaking)

1572
01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.355
(groans) Oh, shit.

1573
01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.525
Fuck. (grunts painfully)

1574
01:13:15.559 --> 01:13:18.394
(Anthony groans)

1575
01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:23.199
(groans) You sleep down below.

1576
01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.400
I'll take up top.

1577
01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:26.870
Take a shower.

1578
01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.872
It'll probably make
you feel better.

1579
01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:31.541
Yeah. (chuckles)

1580
01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:32.576
[Nick] Thanks, yeah.

1581
01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.581
You said you were
at my high school.

1582
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.386
Graduation? (bottle cap clanks)

1583
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.088
Yes, I was.

1584
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:48.091
Was that just another
one of your lies, or what?

1585
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.928
No, I was there.

1586
01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:55.565
And you were with
your girlfriend.

1587
01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:56.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1588
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.437
(grunts) And afterwards,

1589
01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:04.574
the two of you went
out and had a pizza.

1590
01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:07.243
You were still wearing
your graduation robes

1591
01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.747
and looked absolutely
adorable, if I say so.

1592
01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:15.785
(Anthony scoffs) (Nick chuckles)

1593
01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.955
I was sittin' at the
table right next to you.

1594
01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.128
Yeah, that was the
last time I saw ya.

1595
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.131
Hmm.

1596
01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:34.638
- Is that-
- Mm-mmm.

1597
01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:35.505
Yeah.

1598
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.776
Yeah. (clears throat)

1599
01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.778
I... (clears throat)

1600
01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.848
After her burial, I moved
her out, outta there.

1601
01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.116
Why?

1602
01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:47.951
I don't know.

1603
01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.118
I just...

1604
01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.320
I didn't feel right
leavin' her behind,

1605
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.991
and I missed her.

1606
01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:55.859
Yeah.

1607
01:14:57.694 --> 01:15:00.296
She's been there
all these years.

1608
01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.198
(cell phone buzzing)
- Excuse me.

1609
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.802
(Anthony groans painfully)
(cell phone continues buzzing)

1610
01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:08.972
Oh, my god!

1611
01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.840
Mina, (chuckles) hi.

1612
01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:12.308
I...

1613
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.978
I really, I meant
to call, I just...

1614
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.179
I was kinda tied up.

1615
01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.182
Tony?

1616
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:21.685
[Zico] Hola, gringo.

1617
01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:26.189
(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1618
01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:29.826
(Anthony stammers)

1619
01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:31.327
(Zico chuckles)

1620
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.864
(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1621
01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:43.673
(chair shuffles) (Mina whimpers)

1622
01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:47.510
(intense dramatic music)

1623
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.678
What?

1624
01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:50.513
Hey!
- I'm gonna kill that fucker!

1625
01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:51.681
[Nick] Tony, Tony!

1626
01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:52.849
Hey!
- No!

1627
01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:54.050
[Nick] Let the cops
take care of this one.

1628
01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.184
[Anthony] No, I'm
gonna kill that fucker.

1629
01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.019
And then what?

1630
01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.020
And then Bin Farri!

1631
01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:57.854
[Nick] Oh, and then what?

1632
01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.355
You're a DEA agent.

1633
01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.524
All right, fine, fuck it.

1634
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.026
[Nick] No, no!

1635
01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.360
Listen to me.
- What?

1636
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.429
You cross that line,
you end up like me.

1637
01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:11.735
I know what I'm talkin' about.

1638
01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:17.206
(tires squealing)

1639
01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.709
(car engine roaring)

1640
01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:22.578
(tires squealing)

1641
01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:27.416
(car door slams shut)

1642
01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:34.223
(footsteps pattering)
(Anthony pants heavily)

1643
01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:37.927
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1644
01:16:45.769 --> 01:16:47.570
(gun cocks)

1645
01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.305
Put the gun down or I shoot her.

1646
01:16:50.774 --> 01:16:52.575
Put the fucking gun down.

1647
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.945
(intense dramatic music)

1648
01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:58.782
All right.

1649
01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:02.585
(gun clatters)

1650
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.253
And the other one.

1651
01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:08.491
(intense dramatic
music continues)

1652
01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.095
(gun clatters)

1653
01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.096
What now?

1654
01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:13.963
Sit down.

1655
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.633
Call him.

1656
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:19.769
Your boss?

1657
01:17:19.803 --> 01:17:21.270
The old guy that got you out.

1658
01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:22.138
Why?

1659
01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:27.443
- Call him or she's dead.
- Fuck you!

1660
01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.446
You and I both know you're
not gonna shoot her.

1661
01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.948
(gun cocks)
- I won't?

1662
01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:32.816
(Mina sobbing softly)
- No.

1663
01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.984
This neighborhood at this time?

1664
01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:37.286
Cops'll be swarmin'
this place in minutes.

1665
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.788
(Mina continues sobbing)
(chair shuffles)

1666
01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:41.290
Okay. (Mina sobbing)

1667
01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:42.625
(Mina screams)

1668
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.660
Call him or I throw her off!

1669
01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.162
(Mina sobbing)
- Fine.

1670
01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:48.998
Now, let her go.

1671
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.803
(Mina continues sobbing)

1672
01:17:53.837 --> 01:17:55.504
(Mina yells out painfully)

1673
01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:56.806
(cell phone beeping)

1674
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.841
Hey, Dad, it's me.

1675
01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:01.477
(gunshot firing)
(skin squelching)

1676
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.478
(Mina screams)

1677
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.179
(gun clatters) (Anthony grunts)

1678
01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:06.649
(both men grunting)

1679
01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.317
(body thuds)

1680
01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:10.987
(blow lands) (Anthony grunts)

1681
01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.990
(blows continues landing)
(Anthony groaning)

1682
01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:15.491
(Zico grunts) (body thuds)

1683
01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:16.826
(blow lands) (Anthony groans)

1684
01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:17.526
(knife unsheaving)
(both men yelling)

1685
01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.029
(both men groaning)

1686
01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:22.665
(Zico mumbles indistinctly)
(Anthony grunts)

1687
01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:23.499
(gun cocks) (both men groaning)

1688
01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.533
(Zico groans loudly)

1689
01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:27.336
(Zico pants heavily)

1690
01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:28.504
(Mina gasps) (Anthony mumbles)

1691
01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:31.841
(mina whimpers)

1692
01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:34.010
(necklace clanks) (Zico grunts)

1693
01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:34.844
(body thuds)

1694
01:18:34.878 --> 01:18:36.345
(Nick speaks in Spanish)

1695
01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:37.213
It's okay.

1696
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:39.849
Where do I find him?

1697
01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:41.550
Like I'm gonna fuckin' tell you!

1698
01:18:41.584 --> 01:18:43.019
(gunshot firing)
(Zico yelling out painfully)

1699
01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:44.353
Ow, fuck!

1700
01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:46.022
(Zico pants heavily)

1701
01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.523
You could've just
asked me again!

1702
01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.525
I'm old and I don't
have that kinda time!

1703
01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.060
I don't fucking know!

1704
01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:52.862
All he told me was to get you!

1705
01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:54.397
And how were you
supposed to contact him?

1706
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:55.865
Fucking text!

1707
01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.366
And what were you
supposed to say in the text?

1708
01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.567
That I'm on my way.

1709
01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:00.870
- Text him!
- All right, all right!

1710
01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:03.907
(Zico pants heavily)

1711
01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.710
(phone clatters)

1712
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:08.544
[Anthony] Give me the phone.

1713
01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.713
Give me the phone!

1714
01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:11.915
(phone chiming)
- Fuck!

1715
01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:17.420
"Kill the agent, make Nick
watch, then bring him here."

1716
01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:19.722
"I'll give you the
million dollars."

1717
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.424
Look, he shared
his location, too.

1718
01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.560
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars.

1719
01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:27.396
Bin Farri has a
fucking hard-on for you.

1720
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.397
I don't know what you did,

1721
01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.732
but he wants you fuckin' dead.

1722
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.734
A million dollars.

1723
01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.736
I guess you didn't wanna
share that with anyone,

1724
01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.571
so that's why you're here alone?

1725
01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.741
That's pretty
industrious of you, Zico.

1726
01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.743
Who fucking cares, all right?

1727
01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.611
I'm fucked!
- Maybe.

1728
01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:45.581
Maybe not.

1729
01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.951
Maybe you can help
get Bin Farri to me,

1730
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.786
and you keep the million.

1731
01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.288
(laughs) The fuck I will.

1732
01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.790
Yeah fuckin' right.

1733
01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:56.092
And then we just part ways,

1734
01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.260
and never see each other again.

1735
01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.461
Gentleman's agreement.

1736
01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.596
No!

1737
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.131
Fuck that!

1738
01:20:02.165 --> 01:20:04.934
I will kill him before
I let him walk away with

1739
01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:06.435
a million fuckin' dollars!
- Tony?

1740
01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:07.470
Are you kiddin' me?

1741
01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:09.138
[Nick] Bin Farri's the target.

1742
01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.475
You know you killed
my best friend, right?

1743
01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:13.943
For no fuckin' reason!

1744
01:20:13.977 --> 01:20:15.611
I don't wanna kill nobody, man!

1745
01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.114
I just don't wanna
go to El Hongo, man!

1746
01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.616
(sobbing) I don't
wanna go back there.

1747
01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.485
Just fucking kill me now!

1748
01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:24.453
I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with you?!

1749
01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:27.323
Now that kid's gotta grow
up without a fucking dad

1750
01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.792
all because of a piece
of shit like you!

1751
01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:30.793
Then fucking kill me!

1752
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.129
- Gladly!
- No, no, no, Tony!

1753
01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:34.630
No, no, no! (Tico sobbing)

1754
01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:35.798
We need him.

1755
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:36.665
We got a deal.

1756
01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:41.670
(gun clanks)

1757
01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:44.140
Come on, you sorry sack of shit.

1758
01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.642
- (screams) Fuck that!
- Get up!

1759
01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.144
Get on your feet!

1760
01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:49.812
(Zico groans)

1761
01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.481
(siren blares in the distance)

1762
01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:55.518
(Zico pants heavily)

1763
01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:58.821
(Rashida speaks in Arabic)

1764
01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.658
There are 20 patrol
cars outside the building.

1765
01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.660
There's a bomb squad.

1766
01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:05.995
They're trying to
dismantle something

1767
01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:07.163
that looks like a bomb.

1768
01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.332
It doesn't look like a bomb.

1769
01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:10.166
What is this?

1770
01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.534
Why are you involved?

1771
01:21:13.236 --> 01:21:14.837
Why am I involved?

1772
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.840
We will go to Dubai
tonight for the time being.

1773
01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.842
You will learn more
as I need you to.

1774
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.011
I'm not going anywhere.

1775
01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:23.679
You will go where I tell you.

1776
01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.348
No!

1777
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.682
I live here.

1778
01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.584
And you haven't
answered my question.

1779
01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.520
Did you bring a
bomb to my building?

1780
01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.022
- It's not a bomb.
- What is it then?!

1781
01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:34.723
I had a personal project!

1782
01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:36.892
Your personal project
was to build a bomb?

1783
01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.727
We're not that family anymore.

1784
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.030
I needed a place to
keep a quantum device.

1785
01:21:41.064 --> 01:21:42.365
It's not a bomb.

1786
01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:44.867
That's why we needed
to upgrade the power.

1787
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.535
You used me?

1788
01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.437
You had no problems
taking my money.

1789
01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.409
What?

1790
01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:55.578
You know what?

1791
01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:56.712
Fuck this!

1792
01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.047
I'm not going anywhere.

1793
01:21:58.081 --> 01:21:59.215
You agreed to do this.

1794
01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.049
Not this!

1795
01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.250
I'm out!

1796
01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:04.053
The device is being
dismantled as we speak.

1797
01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:05.721
You haven't paid me!

1798
01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:06.555
Manuel is dead.

1799
01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:08.091
It's all over.

1800
01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:10.059
Your people can't keep
a train on tracks.

1801
01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:11.894
Talk about incompetent idiots.

1802
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.897
Fernando, there's no one else.

1803
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.065
You're the only
one who can do it.

1804
01:22:16.099 --> 01:22:17.233
(gunshot firing)
(Rashida screams)

1805
01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.102
(gun clatters)
- That was enough!

1806
01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.270
(Rashida gasping)

1807
01:22:21.304 --> 01:22:24.773
(intense dramatic music)

1808
01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:29.412
[Rashida] What? (gasping)

1809
01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:31.414
(intense dramatic
music continues)

1810
01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:34.617
(car engine rumbling)

1811
01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.622
(brakes squeaking)

1812
01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:41.924
(window motor whirring)

1813
01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:45.428
(Zico pants heavily)

1814
01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:49.098
(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1815
01:22:49.132 --> 01:22:50.933
(radio static)
- Open the door.

1816
01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:55.838
(alarm buzzing)
(garage door clatters)

1817
01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.476
(car engine roars)

1818
01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:03.112
(intense dramatic music)

1819
01:23:03.146 --> 01:23:04.780
(brakes squeaking)

1820
01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:05.614
(gearshift clanks)

1821
01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.283
Get him in the back.

1822
01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:08.617
(car door clatters open)

1823
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:09.618
(radio static)
- Copy.

1824
01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:10.486
He's here.

1825
01:23:12.021 --> 01:23:13.289
(radio clatters)

1826
01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.492
(footsteps pattering)

1827
01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.029
(Zico grunting)

1828
01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:23.299
(door creaks open)

1829
01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.833
(Zico grunts)
Set him over there.

1830
01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:28.471
(Zico pants heavily)

1831
01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.173
What the hell is going on?

1832
01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:32.808
(Zico groans painfully)

1833
01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.644
(footsteps pattering)

1834
01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.646
(Zico groans painfully)

1835
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.681
What is this?

1836
01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.650
What-(Zico speaks in Spanish)

1837
01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:44.320
(Rashida pants heavily)
- Fuck!

1838
01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:45.188
Are we good?

1839
01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.323
Okay.

1840
01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:48.357
Can we do this now?

1841
01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:49.992
(Zico speaks indistinctly)

1842
01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.494
It got a little bit weird.

1843
01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.329
- Same account?
- No.

1844
01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.164
(pants) Use this one.

1845
01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:56.832
(groans) Fuck.

1846
01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:00.669
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1847
01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:02.004
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1848
01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:02.871
Okay.

1849
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.511
Wondering what's next?

1850
01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:09.378
Nah.

1851
01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.216
Judgin' by that
character over there,

1852
01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.517
I get the idea.

1853
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:17.386
Looks like you boys
started the party early.

1854
01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:20.356
Let me see him.

1855
01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:23.859
(dark ominous music)

1856
01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.229
(zipper unzipping)

1857
01:24:26.262 --> 01:24:28.364
(body bag crinkling)

1858
01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:32.701
(Rashida sobs softly)
(dark ominous music continues)

1859
01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:33.702
(body bag whooshing) (gun cocks)

1860
01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:34.537
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Ooohh!

1861
01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:36.205
(interposing voices)

1862
01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:38.707
(guard yells in Spanish)

1863
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:39.742
Do something!

1864
01:24:39.775 --> 01:24:42.545
(pants) I can't.

1865
01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:43.912
I don't have any bullets.

1866
01:24:43.946 --> 01:24:45.548
- Okay, okay, okay!
(body bag crinkling)

1867
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:46.882
(interposing voices)

1868
01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:47.750
No!

1869
01:24:49.252 --> 01:24:50.085
Madam?

1870
01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:53.222
You need to get outta here.

1871
01:24:53.256 --> 01:24:54.223
Go home!

1872
01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:56.058
(stammers) I live here.

1873
01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.260
What?

1874
01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:58.727
[Anthony] Go to
the Cultural Center,

1875
01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.563
ask for Captain Escalante,

1876
01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.798
give him this address,
he'll know what to do.

1877
01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:04.733
Go!

1878
01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:05.901
(Rashida mumbles indistinctly)

1879
01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.271
(footsteps departing)

1880
01:25:08.304 --> 01:25:09.772
(gun clatters) (gunshots firing)

1881
01:25:09.805 --> 01:25:11.740
(gunshots continue firing)

1882
01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:13.075
(body thuds)

1883
01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.077
Okay, okay.

1884
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.912
Now you tell me what you want.

1885
01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.414
A million dollars?

1886
01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:19.282
No.

1887
01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:23.419
(gunshot firing)

1888
01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.421

(Bin Farri groaning painfully)

1890
01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.926
You fucking predator!

1891
01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.795
Let's talk about this!

1892
01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.764
No. (gunshot firing)

1893
01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:39.435
(Bin Farri grunts)
(bullet clatters)

1894
01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:40.769
(gunshot firing) (Sadiq groans)

1895
01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:43.272
(body thuds)

1896
01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:46.475
Okay, gringo, how
do I get my money?

1897
01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:49.645
Get a job.

1898
01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:52.981
What?

1899
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:57.486
(police sirens wailing)

1900
01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:12.801
(officers yelling
commands in Spanish)

1901
01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:14.637
(dispatcher on radio speaks
in Spanish indistinctly)

1902
01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:18.541
(officers speaking in Spanish)

1903
01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:23.479
(door creaks open)

1904
01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:27.650
(officers yelling
commands in Spanish)

1905
01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.852
Zico? (Zico yells muffled)

1906
01:26:29.885 --> 01:26:32.855
(Zico continues yelling muffled)

1907
01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:37.893
(dispatcher speaks indistinctly
in Spanish on radio)

1908
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:43.666
(officers speaking in Spanish)

1909
01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.668
(Captain speaks in Spanish)

1910
01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:48.337
(intense dramatic music)
(body bag unzipping)

1911
01:26:48.371 --> 01:26:50.673
(Zico grunts)

1912
01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.708
(Captain mumbles)

1913
01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:55.511
(tape ripping)

1914
01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.179
(Captain speaks in Spanish)

1915
01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.180
(indistinct chattering
on police radio)

1916
01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.750
(Captain speaks in Spanish)

1917
01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:16.265
(indistinct chattering
on police radio)

1918
01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:20.403
(Anthony imitates motor sounds)

1919
01:27:20.436 --> 01:27:21.870
Whoa, there's a wave comin'!

1920
01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:23.205
And then another wave!

1921
01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.207
What are we gonna do, Captain?

1922
01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.542
What are we gonna do?

1923
01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:28.377
Oh, my god, look at that fog!

1924
01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:29.378
No, don't cry! (baby fussing)

1925
01:27:29.412 --> 01:27:30.546
No, don't.
- You want

1926
01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:31.580
everything on it, right?

1927
01:27:31.614 --> 01:27:32.715
[Anthony] Yes, yes.

1928
01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.249
Here, I'll take that.
(baby fussing)

1929
01:27:34.283 --> 01:27:35.418
[Mina] Oh, my!

1930
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.920
All right, you'll trade off.

1931
01:27:37.953 --> 01:27:39.755
- Whoo!
- Do you have a drink?

1932
01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:40.889
[Anthony] Yeah, I think I do.

1933
01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:41.890
Thank you.

1934
01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:43.392
(groans) Mina?

1935
01:27:43.426 --> 01:27:45.728
(Mina speaks indistinctly)
(baby crying)

1936
01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.229
I gotta tell you,

1937
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.765
this is probably the best
hamburger I've ever had.

1938
01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:51.767
You can't get a decent
hamburger in Mexico.

1939
01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.802
You just gotta rely on the taco.

1940
01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.072
Thank you.

1941
01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.407
I'm better now.
- Aww!

1942
01:27:58.441 --> 01:27:59.575
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1943
01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:01.243
I love this junebug.

1944
01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:02.611
Could hold him all day.

1945
01:28:03.812 --> 01:28:04.913
You guys eat first.

1946
01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:06.248
I'm good right now.

1947
01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.950
My stomach is still
turning from the boat ride.

1948
01:28:07.983 --> 01:28:10.419
Yeah, it was a little
choppy out there today.

1949
01:28:10.453 --> 01:28:11.286
I'm sorry.

1950
01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.588
Ah, it was lovely.

1951
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:14.757
I'm just not used to it.
- Yeah.

1952
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:15.924
Hey!

1953
01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.092
I wanted to ask,

1954
01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.927
how are you settling
into the new apartment?

1955
01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:19.795
It's good?

1956
01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:21.464
Everything is brand new.

1957
01:28:21.497 --> 01:28:23.098
Hmm.

1958
01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.434
[Carlita] We love our
little place, don't we?

1959
01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:26.935
Do you...

1960
01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:28.103
Do you need anything else?

1961
01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.104
We're good.

1962
01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.272
Thank you.

1963
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:31.774
You've done enough.

1964
01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:35.110
I still can't get over that
whole life insurance thing.

1965
01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:35.944
Yeah, I know, that was...

1966
01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:37.980
That was pretty odd.

1967
01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:38.947
What happened?

1968
01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:40.449
(baby fussing)
- No.

1969
01:28:40.483 --> 01:28:41.617
My husband never told me

1970
01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.486
he had a million
dollar life insurance.

1971
01:28:44.687 --> 01:28:47.289
I thought I'd end up in
the streets with a baby.

1972
01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.991
Anthony remembered, thank god!

1973
01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:52.795
And he made them pay.

1974
01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:53.996
Can you imagine?

1975
01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:56.965
Oh, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy.

1976
01:28:56.999 --> 01:28:58.467
(baby fussing) Yeah, yes, da!

1977
01:28:58.501 --> 01:28:59.802
Yessa!
- Hey!

1978
01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.003
(baby continues fussing)

1979
01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:01.837
- Right?
- Thanks to his daddy

1980
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.472
and Uncle Tony,

1981
01:29:03.506 --> 01:29:05.641
this big guy's gonna grow up
in such a nice neighborhood

1982
01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:07.476
with lots of other kids.

1983
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:08.644
Yep.

1984
01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:09.845
And you're gonna
go to college, too.

1985
01:29:09.878 --> 01:29:11.179
(Mina giggling)
- Are you?

1986
01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:13.315
(phone ringing)
Are you gonna go to college?

1987
01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.316
You better. (baby fussing)

1988
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.018
Maybe he'll go to Berkeley?

1989
01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.319
Berkeley?

1990
01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.821
Oh, no, no, no,
not Berkeley, no.

1991
01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:21.323
He's going to Notre Dame on
a full football scholarship.

1992
01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:22.491
Mark my words.

1993
01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:23.325
(Carlita and Mina laughing)
Yeah.

1994
01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.660
Vanowen.

1995
01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:25.861
[Larusso] Look out
over your starboard bow

1996
01:29:25.894 --> 01:29:26.895
by the breaker wall.

1997
01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:31.834
There you go. (chuckles)

1998
01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:33.335
Hey.

1999
01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.538
I see you guys are
having a party without me?

2000
01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:37.840
Well, I'm not upset about that.

2001
01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.207
This isn't a social call.

2002
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:42.678
I figured it wasn't.

2003
01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:44.379
I need a tag-team to
carry out a black warrant

2004
01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:45.748
in San Diego right away.

2005
01:29:46.915 --> 01:29:48.183
All right, cool.

2006
01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.351
[Larusso] Tell the
old man I'm not upset

2007
01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:50.853
about not bein'
invited to the party.

2008
01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:52.020
Yeah, okay.

2009
01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:52.888
Thanks.

2010
01:29:56.058 --> 01:29:59.061
(seagulls squawking)

2011
01:29:59.094 --> 01:29:59.895
(Anthony sighs)

2012
01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:00.863
Fuckin' Frankie!

2013
01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:02.197
He's always wearin' that suit.

2014
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.365
What's that all about?

2015
01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:04.199
I don't know,

2016
01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.068
but he's got a job in San Diego.

2017
01:30:06.101 --> 01:30:07.369
Do you wanna join?

2018
01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:11.740
- (clears throat)
Yeah, count me in.

2019
01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:15.711
(baby crying)

2020
01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:16.745
All right.

2021
01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:21.216
Yeah. (baby continues crying)

2022
01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.752
(all laughing)

2023
01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:30.893
[Anthony] Oh, lord.

2024
01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:35.097
(uptempo pop music
plays in Spanish)

2025
01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:52.615
(intense dramatic music)

2026
01:31:46.869 --> 01:31:50.673
(suspenseful dramatic music)
