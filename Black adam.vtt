00:38.455 --> 00:42.334
[Amon] Before Rome,
before Babylon,

00:42.417 --> 00:45.170
before the pyramids,
there was kahndaq.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.805
The first self-governing people
on earth,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.766
kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.518
For centuries, they thrived.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.776
- But then...
- [People screaming]

01:11.363 --> 01:12.447
Came king ahk-ton.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.953
Using the army to seize power,
ahk-ton became a tyrant.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.621
But he had
even darker ambitions.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.881
Obsessed with dark magic,

01:29.965 --> 01:33.218
ahk-ton's real goal was
to forge the crown of sabbac.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.933
If infused with the powers
of the six demons

01:40.017 --> 01:42.227
- of the ancient world...
- [Thunder crashing]

01:42.311 --> 01:45.188
It would make ahk-ton
invincible.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.190
To make the crown,
he needed eternium.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.942
A rare mineral
of magic properties,

01:49.026 --> 01:51.403
- found only in kahndaq.
- [Miners grunting]

01:51.486 --> 01:53.071
So he enslaved his own people

01:55.032 --> 01:56.783
and forced them to dig.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.495
[Grunting]

02:09.713 --> 02:11.173
[In kahndaqi] Eternium.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.347
[Miners, in kahndaqi] Eternium.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.185
[Miners yelling in kahndaqi]

02:27.898 --> 02:29.649
[Amon] Kahndaq was teetering
on the brink.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.234
[Miners shouting in kahndaqi]

02:31.318 --> 02:32.944
[Amon] What they needed...

02:33.028 --> 02:34.946
[Boy, in kahndaqi]
Get off him! Get off him!

02:35.030 --> 02:37.199
Get off him! Get off him!

02:37.282 --> 02:38.784
[Shouting subsides]

02:38.867 --> 02:40.243
[Amon] ...Was a hero.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.288
[In kahndaqi] Why are we
fighting each other?

02:43.372 --> 02:46.416
Remember who our real enemy is!
Come with me.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.170
Look! Eternium.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.130
Let me see that.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.181
The king thanks you.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.384
He's supposed to reward him.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.142
Is that right?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.477
I want what I'm owed.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.562
Hmm.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.567
You want a reward?

03:14.861 --> 03:16.113
- [Miner grunts]
- [Boy gasps]

03:16.196 --> 03:17.823
The king thanks you
for your service.

[Screaming]

03:25.038 --> 03:26.415
[Breathing heavily]

03:26.498 --> 03:28.458
You want the king's reward, too?

03:30.168 --> 03:33.046
No, but my son accepts
the king's mercy.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.389
I won't always be here
to protect you.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.183
I don't need protection.
I want to be free.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.103
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.563
Let someone else be the hero...

03:49.646 --> 03:51.815
The graveyards are full of them.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.526
Stop dreaming
and go back to work.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.531
[Miners grunting]

03:59.614 --> 04:01.741
[Amon] Someone to hold
the hopes of the people.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.955
Even when all hope seems lost.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.376
[In kahndaqi]
If we had more heroes...

04:11.460 --> 04:14.129
Then maybe our freedom
wouldn't be a dream!

04:16.381 --> 04:17.381
[Soldier grunts]

04:17.424 --> 04:19.259

04:22.762 --> 04:24.139

- [Soldiers yell]

04:29.644 --> 04:33.857
[Miners yelling, cheering]

04:41.948 --> 04:43.700
[Amon] King ahk-ton knew
that this spark

04:43.783 --> 04:45.410
could quickly ignite a fire.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.121
And so, he ordered
that it be snuffed out.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.415
[Crowd chanting indistinctly]

04:52.000 --> 04:53.960
They thought they were
getting a martyr.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.297
Instead...

04:57.380 --> 04:59.180

05:04.930 --> 05:07.140

05:14.731 --> 05:16.011

05:16.066 --> 05:17.651
[In kahndaqi]
The stamina of shu!

05:17.734 --> 05:19.712

the gifts of the ancient gods.

- The courage of mehen!

[In kahndaqi] Hurry.
Give it to me!

05:30.288 --> 05:31.933
[Amon] But the crown had
already been completed.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.077
[In kahndaqi] Give it to me!

05:34.042 --> 05:35.669
[People chattering excitedly]

05:35.752 --> 05:37.104
And when the champion
arrived at the palace

05:37.128 --> 05:39.130
to challenge him...

05:39.214 --> 05:41.341
King ahk-ton summoned
its demonic power.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.766
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

05:49.849 --> 05:52.602
but the champion was victorious.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.563
The wizards hid
the crown of sabbac

05:54.646 --> 05:57.566
so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.527
And the champion
was never heard from again.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.113
["Bullet with butterfly wings"
playing]

06:05.448 --> 06:08.785
Today, kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

06:08.868 --> 06:11.997
the intergang, the latest
in a series of
foreign invaders.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.586
But legend says,
whenever kahndaq
needs him most,

06:17.669 --> 06:21.590
the champion will return
to restore freedom
to the people.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.925
It has been a long, long wait.

broke up with me.

I'm heartbroken.
Now, go on, piss off.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.250
No, what you are
is a Neo-imperialist enforcer,

from halfway around the world,

my country's natural resources,

pollute our water,

07:46.257 --> 07:47.592
oppress our heritage,

07:47.676 --> 07:49.302
and make us wait in lines

08:22.043 --> 08:24.379
Kahndaq isn't safe
for us anymore.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.690
Let's just move the crown first,

08:25.714 --> 08:26.994
and then we can
worry about safe.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
I got intergang
watching my house.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.636
I gave up my job
at the university
and moved four times.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.513
It doesn't mean I'm gonna
abandon my country.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.266
I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.435
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.521

they're days away
from finding it.

but not today, son.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.338
Go, little man. You did good.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.829
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

it's unrefined.

09:55.887 --> 09:59.390
- How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.392
It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back

31:05.405 --> 31:07.074
and lightning thing,
that's a big check.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.871
[Traffic humming faintly]

31:12.954 --> 31:14.372
I don't know this place.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.041
This is your home.

31:19.795 --> 31:20.921
Then my home is gone.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.313
What happened to the crown?

31:39.356 --> 31:40.982
- Too much?
- [Sighs]

31:44.820 --> 31:46.863
[Adrianna] You know it's cursed
with demons, right?

31:46.947 --> 31:50.283
[Music from the good, the bad
and the ugly playing on TV]

31:56.957 --> 32:01.086
"Life is the...
Only path to death."

32:02.671 --> 32:03.964
No shit.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.929
"Teth Adam was a bronze age
kahndaqi Demi-god.

32:11.012 --> 32:15.058
He defeated king ahk-ton
in approximately 2,600 bc."

32:15.142 --> 32:16.726
There. That's you. See?

32:16.810 --> 32:18.079
That's the statue
they built of you.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.813
And now you're back.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.332
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another

32:21.356 --> 32:23.567
ever since you left.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.319
My point is,
kahndaq still isn't free.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.822
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.449
I'm no hero.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.827
[Amon] What?
Superman, Batman, aquaman...

32:33.910 --> 32:35.829
You're way more stacked
than any of them.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.206
And they're not coming
to kahndaq to save us.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.500
But you could stop intergang
all by yourself,

32:40.584 --> 32:41.824
just like you did king ahk-ton.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.253
You're our only hope.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.465
- [Amon exclaims]
- [Gasps]

32:51.386 --> 32:54.890
[Dramatic music continues on TV]

33:06.526 --> 33:07.861
[Gasping]

33:07.944 --> 33:09.988
- Wizards.
- [Chuckles]

33:10.071 --> 33:11.448
I can fix it. Don't worry.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.577
I'm not a wizard.
[Breathing anxiously]

33:17.078 --> 33:20.040
[Laughing] Hey, mom.
He's awake.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.499
I told you
not to go in your room.

33:22.751 --> 33:23.877
It was you who spoke.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.173
You woke me.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.425
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead
if it hadn't worked.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.260
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.596
- Yes.
- Then your enemies
are vanquished,

33:34.679 --> 33:36.598
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.121
Actually, we still have
a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.936
Then destroy them.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.146
Intergang have
guns and flybikes
and eternium rockets.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.230
We have my mom.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.317
Prove your strength.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.040
Destroy your enemy
and all he cares about.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.362
Make him beg for mercy,

33:50.445 --> 33:52.364
but deny it
until his final breath.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.199
Interesting, okay?

33:54.282 --> 33:55.867
I appreciate
what you did for me,

33:55.951 --> 33:59.120
but I do not want you
teaching my son violence.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.123
I understand.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.227
- You want his father
to teach him violence.
- [Coughs]

34:04.251 --> 34:06.091
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.255
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.442
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

34:11.466 --> 34:14.094
Yeah, mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?

34:14.177 --> 34:15.762
No one.

34:15.845 --> 34:19.724
I want a champion to help
free kahndaq from intergang.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.602
Please, help us.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.487
[Exhales deeply]

34:40.912 --> 34:41.913
[Amon] Wait! Wait.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.376
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

34:46.459 --> 34:48.628
You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?

34:48.712 --> 34:50.130
Not really, no.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.732
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.675
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

34:53.758 --> 34:55.820
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal
in our world.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.404
Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,

34:57.429 --> 34:58.638
get a cape, change your name.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.515
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.933
It's a little outdated.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.411
And you definitely need
a catchphrase.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.978
Something blackout bad-ass
to say

35:05.061 --> 35:07.230
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

35:07.314 --> 35:08.773
I don't waste words on the dead.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.543
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.152
I was thinking, like,

35:12.235 --> 35:14.155
"tell them the man in black
sent you." [Chuckles]

35:14.237 --> 35:15.739
- Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

35:15.822 --> 35:17.866
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.802
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really
lean into that.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.370
My point is,
you could be famous.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.497
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

35:24.581 --> 35:27.500
And the superhero
industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.294
I don't need a box for my lunch.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.296
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.092
What else are you gonna do?

35:37.177 --> 35:39.262
[People exclaiming]

35:40.722 --> 35:42.557
Wait! Where are you going?

35:44.351 --> 35:46.186
[People chattering excitedly]

35:58.365 --> 36:01.076
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.827
Most of this was
considered a myth

36:02.911 --> 36:04.704
until yesterday afternoon.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.582
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

36:07.665 --> 36:10.210
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

36:10.293 --> 36:12.170
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.339
[Wry chuckle]

36:14.422 --> 36:16.299
What are you laughing at?

36:16.383 --> 36:18.760
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.471
I know. That's how you laugh.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.806
I've missed having you around

36:22.889 --> 36:25.850
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.977
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

36:28.061 --> 36:30.563
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

36:32.107 --> 36:33.858
This is not a very good plan.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.906
Yeah, well...

36:39.989 --> 36:42.158
A bad plan is better
than no plan at all.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.995
If only there were
a third option.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.594
[Maxine] I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.087
Why not?

36:54.170 --> 36:55.689
'Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.006
It's millions of years old.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.716
It chooses who it lets touch it.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.970
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.432
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

37:05.515 --> 37:06.850
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

37:06.933 --> 37:10.186
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.981
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

37:13.064 --> 37:14.357
[Carter] Coming up on it.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.776
Ready stations in five.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.237
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.572
[Carter] He's not some dude.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.783
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.869
You don't have to
raise your hand.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.392
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed
to stop him?

37:28.455 --> 37:31.374
If we can get him
to say the word, "shazam,"

37:31.458 --> 37:33.543
teth Adam will lose his power.

37:33.626 --> 37:34.961
And we're hoping since he's had

37:35.044 --> 37:37.422
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

37:37.505 --> 37:40.842
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.028
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

37:43.052 --> 37:44.929
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.264
Correct.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.347
Look alive.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.185
We're here.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.523
[Sighs]

37:58.067 --> 38:00.862
- [Entry bell chimes]
- [Townspeople chattering]

38:27.347 --> 38:28.640
[Sobbing]

38:29.307 --> 38:30.934
[Wailing]

38:33.019 --> 38:34.187
[In kahndaqi] Forgive me.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.153
[Indistinct chatter]

38:48.076 --> 38:49.452
[Amon] This is a message

38:49.536 --> 38:51.055
- for all intergang soldiers.
- Hey! Stop!

38:51.079 --> 38:53.331
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

38:59.879 --> 39:00.879
[Grunts loudly]

39:17.355 --> 39:18.565
Teth Adam!

39:20.692 --> 39:22.694
[Quietly] Please.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.780
- There he is! Move!
- [People exclaiming]

39:25.863 --> 39:27.532
- Teth Adam!
- [Checkpoint leader] Move!

39:28.533 --> 39:29.659
- Teth Adam...
- [Grunts]

39:29.742 --> 39:31.119
[Both grunt]

39:31.202 --> 39:33.663
Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?

39:36.583 --> 39:37.667
The statue?

39:39.919 --> 39:41.462
[Adrianna] That's my son.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.673
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

39:44.799 --> 39:45.799
What are you doing?

39:46.759 --> 39:49.387
Hang on. I recognize you.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.097
Where is the crown?

39:52.181 --> 39:53.975
- [Grunts]
- Let's go!

39:54.934 --> 39:55.935
[Adrianna grunts]

40:00.398 --> 40:01.858
[Crowd gasping, exclaiming]

40:05.903 --> 40:08.573
[Screaming]

40:08.656 --> 40:09.842
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

40:09.866 --> 40:10.866
But that was dope.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.664
We need backup down here.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.084
[Gun clicking]

[Screams, grunts]

40:55.119 --> 40:56.162
[Amon laughs]

40:58.748 --> 41:00.541
Tell them
the man in black sent you.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.503
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.672
But before you zap them.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.507
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.590
[Machine guns firing]

41:12.011 --> 41:13.638
[Oldiers screaming]

41:27.985 --> 41:28.985
[Grunts]

41:30.279 --> 41:31.155
He's here.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.532
You sense his presence?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.867
No.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.162
I assume he's the only person
in kahndaq that can do that.

41:39.664 --> 41:40.664
[Maxine gasps]

41:44.168 --> 41:46.671
[Soldiers gasping, whimpering]

41:48.923 --> 41:51.467
Fate and I'll take
the lead. Listen...

41:51.551 --> 41:53.886
Now, you two hang back
till we call you.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.596
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.348
You're ready.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.076
- [Soldiers screaming]
- Uh, he just dropped the, um...

41:59.100 --> 42:00.893
- [Soldiers screaming faintly]
- Shit!

42:02.019 --> 42:04.772
[Wind whistling]

42:06.899 --> 42:07.984
Be prepared.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.655
[Electronic alert beeping]

42:15.616 --> 42:16.616
Um...

42:20.788 --> 42:22.957
[Screaming]

42:26.669 --> 42:28.796
[Both yelling]

42:28.880 --> 42:30.131
Behind you!

42:32.049 --> 42:33.593
[Soldiers yelling]

42:39.974 --> 42:41.392
[Grunts]

42:41.476 --> 42:43.770
[Crowd jeering]

42:43.853 --> 42:45.021
[Man] Let us be!

42:46.647 --> 42:48.900
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

42:48.983 --> 42:50.860
these men should face
due process.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.114
[Crowd cheering]

42:55.198 --> 42:56.866
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.284
- [Woman] Yeah!
- [Man] Yeah!

42:58.367 --> 43:00.578
You don't look like
an intergang.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.122
We're the justice society.

43:03.206 --> 43:06.417
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.921
We're here to restore peace
to kahndaq.

43:10.004 --> 43:13.049
And we will use force
if necessary.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.011
Force is always necessary.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.638
[Dr. Fate] Teth Adam.

43:18.721 --> 43:22.225
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.769
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.355
You have two choices.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.816
Kneel or die.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.985
I was a slave until I died.

43:34.821 --> 43:36.197
Then I was reborn a god.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.159
I kneel before no one.

43:43.788 --> 43:44.872
[Grunts]

43:47.625 --> 43:49.293
Fate, give me a distraction.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.005
[People screaming]

44:42.346 --> 44:45.391
Just say, "shazam."
We all go home.

44:45.474 --> 44:47.560
[Grunts]

44:47.643 --> 44:49.020
I don't have a home.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.860
[Grunts loudly]

44:55.943 --> 44:56.943
[Grunting]

45:00.323 --> 45:01.532
[Yelling]

45:03.242 --> 45:05.036
[Shuddering grunt]

45:07.872 --> 45:10.833
[Both grunting]

45:21.886 --> 45:22.887
Whoo!

45:22.970 --> 45:24.388
Look at that suit. It's cool.

45:24.472 --> 45:26.265
- Thanks. You, too.
- Thank you.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.267

did great work.

turned around back there,

it all worked out, right?

We need to go after him.

We're not strong enough.

Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction
to figure that out

50:55.511 --> 50:57.096
before we get our asses kicked.

One catastrophe at a time.

We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

51:09.566 --> 51:11.360
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.487
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.281
Why do you want
teth Adam to surrender?

51:15.364 --> 51:17.491
He's the champion of kahndaq.
Who are you?

51:17.574 --> 51:19.493
The justice society?

51:19.576 --> 51:21.829
We have been living
under military occupation

51:21.912 --> 51:24.498
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

51:24.581 --> 51:27.209
You didn't come
when intergang
invaded our country,

51:27.293 --> 51:29.878
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

51:29.962 --> 51:32.464
But now, we finally
have our own hero

51:32.548 --> 51:35.801
and you decide
to fly down here
and save us?

51:35.884 --> 51:38.178
Thank you, but...
We're covered.

51:38.262 --> 51:41.849
Go and protect
international stability
someplace else.

51:41.932 --> 51:44.601
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.603
Let me spell it out for you.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.647
Teth Adam can't be
kahndaq's champion

51:48.731 --> 51:50.190
because he is not a hero.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.401
Tell that...

51:52.484 --> 51:56.405
To all the people
he just liberated.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.824
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

51:58.907 --> 52:00.200

- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

52:12.296 --> 52:13.296
I...

52:14.673 --> 52:16.216
Can we please
just see the crown?

52:17.051 --> 52:18.093

52:38.280 --> 52:40.282
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

52:40.366 --> 52:42.785
You don't have
any authority here.

52:42.868 --> 52:44.078
Teth Adam has done nothing...

52:44.161 --> 52:46.830
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.332
And how would you know?

52:48.415 --> 52:50.000
We have access to ancient texts

52:50.084 --> 52:51.960
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

52:52.044 --> 52:54.630
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

52:54.713 --> 52:58.967
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed kahndaq.

52:59.051 --> 53:00.386
And we flew
all the way over here

53:00.469 --> 53:02.763
to stop it from happening again.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.369
[Carter] You want to
go in there alone?

53:07.393 --> 53:09.186
Are you sure?

53:09.269 --> 53:11.855
You want to go in
and fight teth Adam again,
be my guest.

53:11.939 --> 53:14.274
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

53:14.358 --> 53:16.318
without destroying
the rest of my city,

53:16.402 --> 53:17.402
I'm your only shot.

53:40.676 --> 53:42.511
[Teth Adam] You brought
the invaders with you.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.721
They only want to talk.

53:44.805 --> 53:48.100
They can talk. I won't listen.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.396
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother
told me the story

53:52.479 --> 53:55.441
of how the champion came
to this exact spot

53:55.524 --> 53:57.276
to free the enslaved people
of kahndaq

53:57.359 --> 53:59.486
by defeating king ahk-ton
in battle.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.572
But according
to the justice society,

54:01.655 --> 54:03.449
that's not really what happened.

54:03.532 --> 54:06.118
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.707
[King ahk-ton, in kahndaqi]
Hurry. Give it to me!

54:12.958 --> 54:15.085

to exact revenge.

[Energy crackling]

[In kahndaqi] Don't kill me.
I can give you anything
you want.

54:42.237 --> 54:44.031
This is what I want.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.825
[Adrianna] ...Your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.

54:46.909 --> 54:48.368
[People screaming]

54:54.041 --> 54:57.127
And the council of wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

54:57.211 --> 54:59.379
of the gifts that
you were granted.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.465
[In kahndaqi] We have
chosen recklessly...

55:01.548 --> 55:03.842
And humanity has paid the price.

55:03.926 --> 55:07.137
And now, teth Adam...
You must pay.

It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

55:32.454 --> 55:33.914
It was your prison.

55:35.499 --> 55:38.335
And, now, there's
a statue of you.

55:38.418 --> 55:42.089
Out of the hope that
someday kahndaq's champion
would return.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.799
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?

55:43.882 --> 55:45.884
[Teth Adam]
I never said I was a hero.

55:45.968 --> 55:48.178
I never claimed to be anything.

55:48.262 --> 55:50.722
You may not have been a hero.

55:50.806 --> 55:53.308
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

56:00.816 --> 56:02.359
I will hear them out.

56:02.442 --> 56:04.570
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

[Door unlocks, opens]

- [Ishmael] In here, little man.
- [Gasps]

you got buried in the tomb.

- Where's Adrianna?

56:25.215 --> 56:26.425
She's back at the square...

56:26.508 --> 56:27.652
We should go bail her out
right now.

56:27.676 --> 56:28.778
But she's the one
who sent me home

56:28.802 --> 56:30.002
to make sure the crown's safe.

56:30.053 --> 56:31.638
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

you've never learned

57:05.172 --> 57:06.840
When we had a powerful king,

57:06.923 --> 57:10.260
kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

57:10.344 --> 57:11.803

to negotiate the terms

57:53.220 --> 57:55.681
of your peaceful surrender.

I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

your powers ever given to you?

supposed to be here.

to be here.

and your first instinct
was to save me.

58:58.827 --> 59:01.455
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.353
[Soldier 1] Check
the whole place clean.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.463
[Soldier 2]
Cover all access points!

59:09.546 --> 59:11.882
- Keep looking!
- [Indistinct radio chatter]

59:19.473 --> 59:20.473
[Soldier 3] Area's clear.

59:21.767 --> 59:23.351
There! There!
Take him! Take him!

59:23.435 --> 59:24.875
[Soldier 4]
Right there, right there!

59:26.062 --> 59:27.397
[Grunting]

59:27.481 --> 59:28.982
Move, move!

59:29.065 --> 59:31.568
Don't shoot him, I need him!

[Soldiers shouting indistinctly]

59:34.237 --> 59:35.237

[Both shouting]

59:38.533 --> 59:40.076
[Grunts]

59:40.160 --> 59:41.920
[Soldier 5] He's going down,
he's going down!

59:42.746 --> 59:43.955
[Amon grunts]

[Gun cocking]

59:46.666 --> 59:47.793
[Yells]

59:49.544 --> 59:50.796
[Pilot] End of the road, kid!

59:54.090 --> 59:55.467
[Soldiers shouting]

59:58.678 --> 59:59.930
Release the child.

1:00:00.013 --> 1:00:01.431
- Whatever you say.
- [Amon yelling]

1:00:01.515 --> 1:00:03.433
- [Yelling]
- [Teth Adam grunts]

1:00:04.559 --> 1:00:06.394
Yes! Thank you!

1:00:06.478 --> 1:00:09.231
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice
next time.

1:00:11.066 --> 1:00:12.192
[Soldiers screaming]

1:00:12.275 --> 1:00:14.486
Oh! And remember
your catchphrase!

- [Gunfire]
- [Screaming continues]

1:00:19.533 --> 1:00:21.326
Time to go, amon.

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:24.788
[Gunfire continues]

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:30.210
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

1:00:30.293 --> 1:00:32.838
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

1:00:32.921 --> 1:00:34.297
That's the plan, little man.

1:00:34.381 --> 1:00:36.091
We're gonna go for a ride.
Come on.

1:00:36.174 --> 1:00:37.217
[Pilot yelling]

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:40.136
[Pilot gasping, panting]

1:00:50.939 --> 1:00:52.941
Put me down! Put me down!

1:00:53.024 --> 1:00:55.211
You should really be
more careful with
your word choice next time.

1:00:55.235 --> 1:00:56.838
- [Screaming]
- And tell them that
the man in black...

1:00:56.862 --> 1:00:58.113
[Horn blaring]

1:01:00.991 --> 1:01:03.285
[Car alarms wailing]

1:01:03.368 --> 1:01:05.453
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:17.257
Mom?

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:20.135
Amon, where are you?
No, no, no. What?

1:01:20.218 --> 1:01:21.928
I'm in one of their bikes.

1:01:22.012 --> 1:01:23.012
What bikes?

1:01:35.609 --> 1:01:36.735
[Grunts]

1:01:36.818 --> 1:01:40.238
[Pilot grunting, screaming]

[Adrianna exclaims]

1:01:42.198 --> 1:01:43.366
Amon!

1:01:43.450 --> 1:01:44.284
Can you hear me?

1:01:44.367 --> 1:01:45.535
Mom, I'm okay.

1:01:52.250 --> 1:01:53.250
Shit!

1:01:59.799 --> 1:02:01.009
Activate infrared.

1:02:03.887 --> 1:02:04.887
[Hawkman grunts]

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:08.200
[Hawkman] What are you doing?

1:02:08.224 --> 1:02:09.601
Searching for the child.

1:02:09.684 --> 1:02:10.977
No, you're murdering people.

1:02:11.061 --> 1:02:12.687
How else do I find the child?

1:02:12.771 --> 1:02:14.940
I can help you, but no more
extrajudicial killings.

1:02:15.023 --> 1:02:16.775
I don't need any help.

1:02:16.858 --> 1:02:18.985

[Hawkman over radio]
Smasher, cyclone!

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:21.988
What are you waiting for?

1:02:22.072 --> 1:02:24.157
- Come on, let's go!
- [Atom smasher] Uh, okay.

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.326
Okay. I got this. I got this.
On the count of three.

1:02:26.409 --> 1:02:28.078
One, two...

1:02:28.161 --> 1:02:30.288
This feels a lot higher
than last time.

1:02:30.372 --> 1:02:32.415
Whoa!

1:02:32.499 --> 1:02:33.750
Ah! That was not cool!

1:02:42.509 --> 1:02:44.229
- [Tires squealing]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:45.804
Hey, guys. Slow down.

1:02:49.349 --> 1:02:51.518

[Grunts]

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:13.248
Hey, careful, dude!
I almost hit you.

1:03:13.331 --> 1:03:14.624
[Hawkman grunts]

1:03:16.126 --> 1:03:19.170
- [Sharp grunt]

1:03:19.254 --> 1:03:20.839
[Atom smasher]
I am so sorry. I just...

1:03:20.922 --> 1:03:22.233
I don't really have
peripheral vision in the mask.

1:03:22.257 --> 1:03:23.925
It's my uncle's.
I'll get it tailored.

1:03:24.009 --> 1:03:25.260
Me and you.

1:03:25.343 --> 1:03:26.469
Roger that.

1:03:53.747 --> 1:03:54.831
[Yelps, whimpers]

[Karim gasping, panting]

1:04:11.222 --> 1:04:13.391
- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

1:04:13.475 --> 1:04:16.936
How bad is it, doc? Am I dying?

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:18.605
I'm not that kind of doctor.

1:04:18.688 --> 1:04:20.315
But don't worry,
I can see the future.

1:04:20.398 --> 1:04:22.442
This isn't how you're
going to die.

1:04:22.525 --> 1:04:23.777
How do I die, then?

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.570
Just stay away from electricity.

1:04:25.653 --> 1:04:28.656
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:30.220
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

1:04:32.952 --> 1:04:33.995

The champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

1:05:42.647 --> 1:05:43.647
I'm counting on it.

Teth Adam. Where are you?

1:05:58.872 --> 1:05:59.873
You followed me?

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:01.666
My mind and body can exist

1:06:01.749 --> 1:06:03.751
in different places
at the same time.

1:06:03.835 --> 1:06:05.420
Did you find the boy?

1:06:05.503 --> 1:06:07.064
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:09.591
Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:10.675
Uh...

1:06:12.302 --> 1:06:14.137
You killed him, didn't you?

1:06:18.766 --> 1:06:19.766
[Faint impact]

He didn't make it.

[Maxine]
The bullet's extracted.

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:28.484
The tissue damage
has been repaired.

Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

1:06:33.031 --> 1:06:34.300

1:06:34.324 --> 1:06:35.324
[Exhales]

1:06:36.659 --> 1:06:37.659
That is insane.

1:06:38.995 --> 1:06:40.997
The nanobots did
most of the work.

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.291
No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

1:06:43.374 --> 1:06:45.376
I literally just witnessed
a miracle.

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:46.961
[Maxine] Mmm-mmm. [Chuckles]

1:06:47.045 --> 1:06:48.713
What? I say something stupid?

1:06:48.796 --> 1:06:51.591
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

1:06:51.674 --> 1:06:53.384
grow a hundred times
your own size.

1:06:53.468 --> 1:06:55.628
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

1:06:55.678 --> 1:06:57.180
- [Chuckles]
- I don't know, it's...

1:06:58.181 --> 1:06:59.181
It's cool.

1:07:00.391 --> 1:07:02.477
Thank you.

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:03.853
But it's not as cool
as nanobots.

1:07:06.189 --> 1:07:08.316
That's how you do
your wind thing.

1:07:08.399 --> 1:07:10.985
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

1:07:11.069 --> 1:07:13.005
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:14.489
by this really
messed-up scientist

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:15.949
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

1:07:20.078 --> 1:07:21.663
I'm... so sorry.

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:24.249
No, you're good.

1:07:24.332 --> 1:07:26.084
It seems like you
really turned it around.

1:07:26.167 --> 1:07:27.502
Found your calling.

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:29.963

1:07:31.881 --> 1:07:33.549
[Crying softly]

[Kent] There's no point
in dwelling in the past.

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:42.809
It's already moved on from you.

1:07:47.105 --> 1:07:48.564
Why did you say that?

1:07:48.648 --> 1:07:51.192
You were blaming yourself
for trusting ishmael.

1:07:51.276 --> 1:07:54.445
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

1:07:54.529 --> 1:07:55.613
not those you can't.

1:07:56.948 --> 1:07:58.741

You see the future?

1:07:58.825 --> 1:08:00.618
Tell me how I get my son back.

1:08:02.036 --> 1:08:03.204
By trusting us.

1:08:03.288 --> 1:08:06.582
Karim will live.
We will save amon.

1:08:06.666 --> 1:08:07.750
It's what we do.

1:08:12.964 --> 1:08:15.300
I suppose
they didn't have doors
in your day.

1:08:15.383 --> 1:08:18.720
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

1:08:18.803 --> 1:08:20.805
What I did there
is called sarcasm.

1:08:20.888 --> 1:08:23.057
Where is amon?
Did you find him?

1:08:23.141 --> 1:08:24.350
Not yet, but I will.

1:08:24.434 --> 1:08:25.714
The men who took him
will suffer.

[Soldiers grunting]

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:28.560
Maybe these guys can help.

1:08:30.732 --> 1:08:33.234
There's an upside
to keeping prisoners.

1:08:33.318 --> 1:08:35.111
They can answer our questions.

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:36.571

- Adrianna. Adrianna.
- [Panting]

1:08:47.915 --> 1:08:49.542
I've learned that
in this modern world,

1:08:49.625 --> 1:08:51.044
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:52.807
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

1:08:54.130 --> 1:08:56.132
[Adrianna] No.

1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:58.110
[Teth Adam] Let's start with
just one simple question.

1:08:58.134 --> 1:09:00.970
- Can either of you fly?
- [Both gasp]

1:09:01.054 --> 1:09:02.555
- [Soldiers screaming]
- Shit.

1:09:04.307 --> 1:09:05.725
I think I'll sit this one out.

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:11.314
[Thunder crashing]

1:09:13.066 --> 1:09:15.693
Tell me what you did with amon.

1:09:15.777 --> 1:09:17.987
You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

1:09:18.071 --> 1:09:19.530
I'm not going to drop them.

1:09:21.616 --> 1:09:23.159
I'm going to drop one of them.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:25.620
Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?

1:09:25.703 --> 1:09:27.288
I don't know.

1:09:27.372 --> 1:09:28.581
[Screaming]

1:09:33.628 --> 1:09:35.296
He's at our mine in the desert.

1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:36.839
I can show... [screaming]

1:09:38.591 --> 1:09:40.635

1:09:40.718 --> 1:09:42.136
[Soldier screaming in distance]

1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:44.013
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1:09:46.432 --> 1:09:48.032
You said you wouldn't hurt
the prisoners.

1:09:48.059 --> 1:09:49.852
That was sarcasm.

1:09:49.936 --> 1:09:52.313
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

1:09:52.397 --> 1:09:53.791
Intergang have a mine
in the desert.

1:09:53.815 --> 1:09:55.108
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:57.402
It's near
the al hadidiyah mountains.

1:09:57.485 --> 1:09:58.486
Let's go.

1:09:58.569 --> 1:09:59.987
[Soldiers screaming, grunting]

1:10:00.071 --> 1:10:02.198
I told you, stop killing people!

1:10:02.281 --> 1:10:03.199
They look alive to me.

1:10:03.282 --> 1:10:05.159
Because I saved them.

1:10:05.243 --> 1:10:06.970
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

1:10:06.994 --> 1:10:09.038
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

1:10:10.123 --> 1:10:11.416
I did it your way.

1:10:11.499 --> 1:10:12.542
He does have a point.

1:10:14.001 --> 1:10:15.878

If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

1:23:35.969 --> 1:23:37.679
[Arrows clattering]

1:23:40.641 --> 1:23:41.934
[Bow string creaking]

1:23:45.437 --> 1:23:47.522
But he couldn't save himself

1:23:47.606 --> 1:23:49.983
from the king's assassins.

1:23:50.067 --> 1:23:52.444
[Yelling in kahndaqi]

1:23:52.527 --> 1:23:55.113
The powers were not a gift
from the wizards...

1:23:55.197 --> 1:23:56.073
[Whispering in kahndaqi]

1:23:56.156 --> 1:23:57.156
But a curse.

1:23:57.199 --> 1:24:00.077
[Yelling loudly]

1:24:07.376 --> 1:24:09.962
Born... out of rage.

1:24:12.923 --> 1:24:14.883
The statue of the champion
isn't you.

1:24:18.136 --> 1:24:19.221
It's hurut.

1:24:22.391 --> 1:24:24.268
My son dreamt of a better world.

1:24:25.727 --> 1:24:27.062
That's why he saved me.

1:24:32.067 --> 1:24:34.152
But the world was only
a better place with him in it.

1:24:50.460 --> 1:24:51.837
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1:24:53.630 --> 1:24:55.215
Instead, it got me.

1:24:58.218 --> 1:24:59.553
All this power...

1:25:01.305 --> 1:25:04.599
And the only thing
I can do with it
is hurt people.

1:25:04.683 --> 1:25:07.185
I will speak the word
my son gave me,

1:25:07.269 --> 1:25:08.687
and I will give up my power.

1:25:11.481 --> 1:25:15.027
And when I do, you must ensure
I never speak it again.

1:25:20.907 --> 1:25:22.200
Shazam.

1:25:22.284 --> 1:25:23.994
[Thunder echoing]

1:25:30.083 --> 1:25:33.670
[In kahndaqi] Some men
are not meant... to be heroes.

1:26:09.331 --> 1:26:11.500
[Monitor beeping]

1:26:18.882 --> 1:26:20.217
Hey!

1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:40.362
[Chuckling] So beautiful.

1:27:06.805 --> 1:27:08.390
Surprised to see us?

1:27:08.473 --> 1:27:11.476
Surprise is a dirty word
in this business.

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:13.061
Are you sure you can handle him?

1:27:14.563 --> 1:27:16.040
You're the one who can
see the future,

1:27:16.064 --> 1:27:17.315
you'll tell me if we can't.

1:27:17.399 --> 1:27:19.860
Just be careful with this one.

1:27:19.943 --> 1:27:22.362
You know,
they say the gods created us,

1:27:22.446 --> 1:27:24.865
but we're the ones
who always wind up
burying them.

1:27:26.825 --> 1:27:28.243
Waller sends her regards.

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:37.294
[Kent] They'll know
how to deal with him.

1:27:37.377 --> 1:27:40.005
To keep him
from regaining his powers,

1:27:40.088 --> 1:27:41.923
they'll keep him
in suspended animation.

1:27:49.639 --> 1:27:52.893
As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.

1:27:57.856 --> 1:27:59.524
He'll never say
another word again.

1:28:19.044 --> 1:28:21.505
Hey! There he is.

1:28:21.588 --> 1:28:25.175
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1:28:25.258 --> 1:28:26.885
- [Laughs]
- Well, statistically,

1:28:26.968 --> 1:28:29.054
most heroes don't wear capes.
But, yeah, try it on.

1:28:32.682 --> 1:28:34.726
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1:28:34.809 --> 1:28:37.354
[Wind blowing lightly]

1:28:37.437 --> 1:28:39.064
That's a nice touch.

1:28:39.147 --> 1:28:40.440
[Mimics wind whooshing]

1:28:53.203 --> 1:28:56.790
[Faint, distorted voices
chanting]

1:29:02.045 --> 1:29:04.589
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

1:29:04.673 --> 1:29:07.467
[Distant rumble of thunder]

1:29:10.971 --> 1:29:12.180
[Screaming loudly]

1:29:12.264 --> 1:29:13.515
[Exhales]

1:29:16.101 --> 1:29:17.101
[Kent moans]

1:29:19.604 --> 1:29:20.604
Kent.

1:29:22.274 --> 1:29:23.400
- Kent!
- [Gasps]

1:29:26.736 --> 1:29:27.862
Mission accomplished?

1:29:27.946 --> 1:29:30.240
My vision hasn't changed.

1:29:30.323 --> 1:29:32.492
But teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1:29:32.576 --> 1:29:35.245
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1:29:35.328 --> 1:29:36.955
What is the helmet telling you?

1:29:38.582 --> 1:29:41.876
My vision has always shown me
a great calamity.

1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:44.004
The world in flames.

1:29:44.087 --> 1:29:45.380
We can stop it...

1:29:47.215 --> 1:29:48.216
But you die.

1:29:50.719 --> 1:29:51.970
You should've told me sooner.

1:29:55.348 --> 1:29:57.183
I have no fear of death.

1:29:57.267 --> 1:29:59.269
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1:29:59.352 --> 1:30:01.605
The world needs
the justice society.

1:30:01.688 --> 1:30:03.523
The world needs you.

1:30:03.607 --> 1:30:06.526
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1:30:06.610 --> 1:30:07.610
That's fate, right?

1:30:08.820 --> 1:30:10.905
[Chuckles ruefully]

1:30:10.989 --> 1:30:12.407
That sounds familiar.

1:30:15.410 --> 1:30:17.287
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1:30:19.122 --> 1:30:24.044
It was an raf deployment,
headed to the western front.

1:30:24.127 --> 1:30:26.338
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1:30:26.963 --> 1:30:28.673
Mmm.

1:30:28.757 --> 1:30:29.841
But I didn't cheer.

1:30:31.843 --> 1:30:34.512
Even though I was only a boy.

1:30:34.596 --> 1:30:39.100
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1:30:39.184 --> 1:30:40.602
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1:30:40.685 --> 1:30:42.854
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1:30:42.937 --> 1:30:44.522
I've seen the world change

1:30:44.606 --> 1:30:46.566
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1:30:49.819 --> 1:30:51.696
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1:30:53.239 --> 1:30:54.991
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1:30:58.119 --> 1:30:59.162
[Sighs]

1:31:03.208 --> 1:31:08.088
Ishmael said, "death
is the only path to life."

1:31:08.171 --> 1:31:10.382
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1:31:10.465 --> 1:31:13.760
Right. "Life is
the only path to death."

1:31:13.843 --> 1:31:15.261
Maybe he got it backwards,

1:31:15.345 --> 1:31:17.597
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1:31:17.681 --> 1:31:19.182
That's it.

1:31:19.265 --> 1:31:21.559
In kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1:31:21.643 --> 1:31:23.728
are sent
to the rock of finality.

1:31:23.812 --> 1:31:25.897
The underworld
is a mirror to our own.

1:31:25.980 --> 1:31:27.732
Here, turn the crown around.

1:31:29.401 --> 1:31:30.694
Now mirror the letters.

1:31:30.777 --> 1:31:33.822
See? That's what I missed.

1:31:33.905 --> 1:31:37.909
"Death is
the only path to life."

1:31:40.245 --> 1:31:41.788
[Gasps]

1:31:41.871 --> 1:31:44.165
[Adrianna] He kidnapped amon
on purpose,

1:31:44.249 --> 1:31:46.751
because he knew
that teth Adam would kill him.

1:31:46.835 --> 1:31:48.878
And he believed
the champion's magic

1:31:48.962 --> 1:31:50.797
would send him
to the rock of finality.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:54.426
As life is the path to death.

1:31:54.509 --> 1:31:58.263
[Demon 1] Now your death
is a path to life.

1:31:58.346 --> 1:32:00.432
[Demon 2] The wizards
have their champion,

1:32:00.515 --> 1:32:02.642
now we have ours.

1:32:02.726 --> 1:32:05.478
[Demon 3] You will take
the throne of kahndaq

1:32:05.562 --> 1:32:09.607
and unleash hell on earth!

1:32:09.691 --> 1:32:11.776
[Demons] Speak our name.

1:32:12.402 --> 1:32:13.402
"Sabbac."

1:32:14.738 --> 1:32:17.949
[Screaming]

1:32:34.799 --> 1:32:36.801
[Kent] What the bloody hell
is that?

1:32:36.885 --> 1:32:38.645
[Carter] Readout says
it's the demon, sabbac.

1:32:38.678 --> 1:32:41.014
Get me closer. Now, right now!

1:32:41.097 --> 1:32:42.807
We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!

1:32:50.315 --> 1:32:55.695
[In kahndaqi]
The king has returned!
The throne will be mine!

1:32:58.198 --> 1:32:59.407
Brace yourselves!

1:33:02.452 --> 1:33:03.995
[Roaring]

1:33:04.078 --> 1:33:05.288
[All yell]

1:33:05.371 --> 1:33:06.498
Hold on!

1:33:06.581 --> 1:33:07.582
[Alarm beeping]

1:33:08.374 --> 1:33:09.374
[Grunts]

1:33:10.126 --> 1:33:11.126
[Sabbac grunts]

1:33:22.972 --> 1:33:25.350
- [Straining]
- [People shouting]

1:33:25.433 --> 1:33:27.477
[Carter straining]

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:30.313
[People shouting, screaming]

1:33:40.073 --> 1:33:43.451
[Scattered shouting, yelling]

1:33:43.535 --> 1:33:44.845
[Sabbac, in English]
Now prepare to die.

1:33:44.869 --> 1:33:45.869
[Grunts]

1:33:48.248 --> 1:33:49.541
[Both grunt]

1:33:51.042 --> 1:33:52.322
Wait, wait, where's uncle karim?

1:33:54.420 --> 1:33:55.420
[Atom smasher coughs]

1:33:58.591 --> 1:33:59.634
[Yells]

1:34:04.097 --> 1:34:05.348
[Groans]

1:34:05.431 --> 1:34:06.431
[Grunts]

1:34:09.227 --> 1:34:12.230
[Hawkman] No matter
what happens, he does not
sit on that throne.

1:34:15.692 --> 1:34:17.336
- [Atom smasher] Copy that.
- [Cyclone] We're on it!

1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:18.360
Heads up!

1:34:21.698 --> 1:34:22.740
[Grunts]

1:34:27.328 --> 1:34:28.580
[Growls]

1:34:28.663 --> 1:34:30.999
[Both grunting]

1:34:41.801 --> 1:34:42.801
[Yells]

1:34:48.683 --> 1:34:50.184
[Grunting]

1:34:51.311 --> 1:34:53.062
[Atom smasher grunting loudly]

1:35:03.156 --> 1:35:04.240
Activate infrared.

1:35:04.324 --> 1:35:05.491
[Atom smasher grunts]

1:35:06.367 --> 1:35:07.994
[Cyclone cries out]

1:35:08.077 --> 1:35:09.829
Sabbac, show yourself!

1:35:12.248 --> 1:35:15.084
- [People yelling]
- Adrianna! Amon!

1:35:18.004 --> 1:35:19.380
[Sabbac yells]

1:35:19.464 --> 1:35:20.924
That's for my cruiser.

1:35:21.007 --> 1:35:23.092
- [Grunts heavily]
- [Sabbac screams]

1:35:26.596 --> 1:35:28.848
[Growling]

1:35:33.144 --> 1:35:34.144
[Grunts]

1:35:35.021 --> 1:35:36.397
[Growls]

1:35:38.524 --> 1:35:39.609
[Sabbac grunts]

1:35:47.825 --> 1:35:48.826
[Gasps]

1:35:55.208 --> 1:35:56.376
[Groans]

1:35:59.545 --> 1:36:00.546
[Dr. Fate] This is it.

1:36:02.048 --> 1:36:03.675
We can't win, Carter.

1:36:03.758 --> 1:36:06.761
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1:36:09.013 --> 1:36:11.265
Bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:16.646
[Panting]

1:36:30.785 --> 1:36:32.662
[Thuds]

1:36:32.745 --> 1:36:34.539
[Shield resonating]

1:36:38.251 --> 1:36:40.253
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1:36:40.336 --> 1:36:42.130
Giving us a third option.

1:36:42.213 --> 1:36:43.631
It's supposed to be me.

1:36:43.715 --> 1:36:45.842
I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend.

1:36:46.884 --> 1:36:48.302
I did see your death.

1:36:48.386 --> 1:36:50.763
But I also found a way
to prevent it.

1:36:50.847 --> 1:36:52.890
It has been
an extraordinary life,

1:36:52.974 --> 1:36:55.309
but always with one foot
in the future.

1:36:55.393 --> 1:36:58.604
Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,

1:36:58.688 --> 1:36:59.856
when I look ahead...

1:37:02.608 --> 1:37:03.818
I see nothing.

1:37:03.901 --> 1:37:04.902
No, Kent.

1:37:04.986 --> 1:37:05.986
And...

1:37:06.946 --> 1:37:07.947
It's...

1:37:08.948 --> 1:37:09.782
Beautiful.

1:37:09.866 --> 1:37:10.908
Wait, Kent!

1:37:10.992 --> 1:37:12.118
Goodbye...

1:37:12.201 --> 1:37:13.911
Kent! [Grunting loudly]

1:37:13.995 --> 1:37:15.079
My dear friend.

1:37:15.163 --> 1:37:16.247
Kent! [Grunts]

1:37:19.042 --> 1:37:20.418
[Hawkman] Hit it
from every side.

1:37:22.253 --> 1:37:24.547
[Yelling] Kent!

1:37:24.630 --> 1:37:26.340
[Grunting]

1:37:27.258 --> 1:37:28.342
No!

1:37:46.152 --> 1:37:47.987
[Growling]

1:37:48.071 --> 1:37:53.201
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the lords of order,

1:37:53.284 --> 1:37:56.329
defender against darkness
and chaos,

1:37:56.412 --> 1:37:58.915
but even my powers
cannot defeat you.

1:38:00.833 --> 1:38:02.794
[Sabbac grunting]

1:38:09.092 --> 1:38:11.385
There's no one
that can defeat me.

1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:15.723
[Grunting]

1:38:15.807 --> 1:38:19.560
[Dr. Fate echoing]
There is one... there is one...

1:38:20.228 --> 1:38:21.312
Teth Adam.

1:38:22.772 --> 1:38:24.315
I know you can hear me.

1:38:26.275 --> 1:38:30.071
The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.

1:38:30.154 --> 1:38:32.448
Now you are the only one

1:38:32.532 --> 1:38:34.742
who can defeat
the demon champion.

1:38:52.093 --> 1:38:53.636
[All yelling]

1:38:53.719 --> 1:38:56.222
- [Blow landing]
- [Soldier grunting]

1:38:59.475 --> 1:39:00.852
[Grunting]

1:39:00.935 --> 1:39:02.270
You have the power

1:39:02.353 --> 1:39:04.480
to be the destroyer
of this world.

1:39:07.650 --> 1:39:10.403
But you can also be its savior.

1:39:15.158 --> 1:39:17.535
[All grunting]

1:39:21.247 --> 1:39:22.247
[Yells]

1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:30.256
You believe
you are not a worthy champion

1:39:30.339 --> 1:39:32.925
because the wizards
