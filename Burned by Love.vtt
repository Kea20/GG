No! We just lost track of time,
you know?

He was telling me about
his childhood,

Demanding you to stop using
our company's name.

even a slight delay

292
00:14:47.128 --> 00:14:49.946
In material shipments
and I'll be out of work.

293
00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:52.298
It's the cost of doing business
on an island.

our video calls, right?

money's not even the trifle,

right now?

I mean, um...

313
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.445
If I loaned you some money,

314
00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:50.431

Ashley, no. No.

316
00:15:51.859 --> 00:15:54.786
No. Thank you so much,
but I can't let you do that.

a good reason.

It's fine, it's temporary,
right?

321
00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.613
And then we can sort it out
when I'm there.

00:41:16.883 --> 00:41:18.866
I know. I mean...

716
00:41:18.885 --> 00:41:20.793
Look, roger's done some
awful things,

717
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:23.204
But I can't imagine him
being capable

718
00:41:23.223 --> 00:41:24.647
Of doing something like this,
you know?

719
00:41:25.892 --> 00:41:27.875
- What next?
- Well, the police said

720
00:41:27.969 --> 00:41:29.486
They'll still question him
either way,

721
00:41:29.713 --> 00:41:31.879
So we'll see what comes of it.
But...

722
00:41:31.973 --> 00:41:33.823
I don't know. I don't know.

723
00:41:33.975 --> 00:41:36.826
Whatever happens, you're not
staying here alone tonight.

724
00:41:37.053 --> 00:41:39.721
Why don't you come stay with me
for a few days?

725
00:41:39.814 --> 00:41:41.331
I really don't want
to stay alone,

726
00:41:41.558 --> 00:41:43.166
But I also don't want to impose
on you like that.

727
00:41:43.317 --> 00:41:44.742
I know how much you like
your space.

728
00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:46.561
Oh, okay, alright.

729
00:41:46.654 --> 00:41:48.588
I will make my chicken parm
sliders.

730
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.491
Thanks, tess. I owe you.

731
00:41:52.585 --> 00:41:54.344
(cell phone chiming)

732
00:41:54.571 --> 00:41:56.012
What is it?

733
00:41:57.665 --> 00:41:58.831
Oh, great.

734
00:41:58.925 --> 00:42:01.518
Something is up at
the restaurant. It's grant.

735
00:42:01.669 --> 00:42:03.353
I gotta go. Come on.

736
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.676
Grant?
Everything alright?

737
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.862
I just got off the phone with
the police.

738
00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:15.114
- Jacqueline is on her way.
- Why?

739
00:42:23.433 --> 00:42:25.041
- (gasping)
- this is how I found it.

740
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.044
Ashley, I'm so sorry.

741
00:42:29.455 --> 00:42:30.713
How could someone do this?

742
00:42:30.865 --> 00:42:32.940
They broke everything!

743
00:42:32.959 --> 00:42:35.960
If you were to start right away,
do you think maybe

744
00:42:36.112 --> 00:42:38.537
You could have this done before
the opening?

745
00:42:38.631 --> 00:42:40.782
'cause what I could do is
I could source the materials,

746
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.208
I could ask favors for you,
if you need.

747
00:42:43.303 --> 00:42:44.227
Ashley:
I-I mean...

748
00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:49.957
Replacing the materials alone
could take... Weeks,

749
00:42:50.051 --> 00:42:51.809
And then having to redo
all this.

750
00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:54.478
Yeah.

751
00:42:54.573 --> 00:42:56.798
Wait, was this the only damage
that was done, nothing else?

752
00:42:56.891 --> 00:42:58.800
No, they, uh, they got
my tool bag,

753
00:42:58.818 --> 00:43:01.411
Which is like, about three grand
worth of gear.

754
00:43:01.562 --> 00:43:02.728
Oh, I'm sorry.

755
00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.972
But I didn't see anything else.
Just, um...

756
00:43:04.991 --> 00:43:07.399
I mean, nothing like this.

757
00:43:07.493 --> 00:43:10.086
You know what? They didn't even
check the cash register.

758
00:43:11.664 --> 00:43:13.089
I think this was personal.

759
00:43:15.985 --> 00:43:17.501
Roger.

760
00:43:17.654 --> 00:43:19.821
- It has to be.
- Wait...

761
00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:21.672
You think your ex would do
something like this?

762
00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:24.342
- You think he's this petty?
- I don't know!

763
00:43:24.436 --> 00:43:26.494
I mean, it's something I'm gonna
have to ask him myself.

764
00:43:26.512 --> 00:43:28.271
This is... This is insane.

765
00:43:31.517 --> 00:43:33.776
It's okay, you don't have to do
that, I'll take care of this.

766
00:43:34.003 --> 00:43:35.260
- It's fine.
- Jacqueline: I'm here!

767
00:43:35.355 --> 00:43:36.446
Show me the damage.

768
00:43:38.675 --> 00:43:40.842
Oh my god, it's true.

769
00:43:40.935 --> 00:43:42.619
- Was anybody hurt?
- No.

770
00:43:44.514 --> 00:43:45.863
- What did they take?
- Well, apparently

771
00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:48.941
They took grant's tools, but the
cash register wasn't touched

772
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.536
And nothing else was stolen.
Just...

773
00:43:52.689 --> 00:43:54.797
Oh, this beautiful work.

774
00:43:55.024 --> 00:43:56.782
Ruined.

775
00:43:56.801 --> 00:44:00.044
Oh, that is such a violation.

776
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:03.364
I think I can still make this
work if I could just

777
00:44:03.457 --> 00:44:06.476
Have a little more time,
I can fix this.

778
00:44:06.627 --> 00:44:08.645
You really think you can
fix this?

779
00:44:08.796 --> 00:44:11.130
Yes, if you could just
give me...

780
00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:14.542
- Just another two weeks or so.
- Another two weeks?

781
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.819
- I needed this ready by Friday.
- I know.

782
00:44:17.046 --> 00:44:19.563
I have my reputation
on the line.

783
00:44:19.716 --> 00:44:20.731

still thinks back

To all those nights that we
stayed up sharing

890
00:49:55.384 --> 00:49:56.975
- Intimate stories.
- Tess: No.

891
00:49:56.995 --> 00:49:59.662
Throw those memories
in the trash with marco.

with grant?

Did you do all this?

917
00:52:37.471 --> 00:52:40.214
Yeah, I started sweeping just
after you left,

918
00:52:40.307 --> 00:52:42.324
So I guess I got a little
carried away.

919
00:52:42.551 --> 00:52:46.162

useful.

Check it out.

00:52:50.409 --> 00:52:52.409
Ashley:
Oh my gosh.

922
00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:54.561
Grant: First I wanted to make
sure that I found

923
00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.488
All the right pieces,
and then I started seeing

924
00:52:56.582 --> 00:52:58.565
How it was looking all smashed
up together like that,

925
00:52:58.659 --> 00:53:01.010
And I just-- I thought
it looked cool.

926
00:53:01.237 --> 00:53:03.070
Yeah, it's like the japanese
pottery art.

927
00:53:03.088 --> 00:53:04.588
You know, how they take
something broken

928
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:06.331
And they turn it into something
beautiful?

929
00:53:06.425 --> 00:53:07.332
- Yeah.
- Kintsugi.

930
00:53:07.426 --> 00:53:08.517
Kintsugi, oh yeah,

931
00:53:08.744 --> 00:53:10.186
I know exactly what you're
talking about.

932
00:53:12.264 --> 00:53:13.772
Grant, this is...

933
00:53:15.434 --> 00:53:16.934
Thank you so much.

934
00:53:17.086 --> 00:53:19.010
- This is unbelievable.
- You're welcome.

935
00:53:19.104 --> 00:53:21.422
I mean, I just wish it happened
before I was fired, so--

936
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.515
No, you're not fired. No.

937
00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:25.367
Don't worry about jacqueline.

938
00:53:25.594 --> 00:53:27.945
People usually get fired like
six or seven times

939
00:53:28.097 --> 00:53:29.354
- Before it actually sticks.
- (chuckling)

940
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:30.931
- What?
- Yeah, I think I've been fired,

941
00:53:31.024 --> 00:53:32.599
- Like, three times now.
- Really?

942
00:53:32.618 --> 00:53:35.044
I think once she sees this
on a grander scale,

943
00:53:35.271 --> 00:53:37.129
She's-- she's gonna change
her tune.

944
00:53:38.457 --> 00:53:41.050
- I hope so.
- It's true.

- Yeah.

Hello?

949
00:53:50.286 --> 00:53:51.644
This is she.

950
00:53:53.622 --> 00:53:54.897
Okay.

951
00:53:56.459 --> 00:53:57.900
Thank you.
Thank you for letting me know.

952
00:53:59.237 --> 00:54:01.219
What was that?

953
00:54:01.239 --> 00:54:03.239
Roger was attacked last night.

954
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.482
- What?
- It was the hospital.

955
00:54:05.634 --> 00:54:08.577
I don't know what happened,
they didn't...

956
00:54:08.804 --> 00:54:11.062
Look, I've gotta go.
I'll be back, okay?

957
00:54:11.156 --> 00:54:13.064
Of course, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

958
00:54:13.084 --> 00:54:14.583
- Ashley: Are you okay?
- Roger: I'm fine.

959
00:54:14.735 --> 00:54:16.326
I've been hurt worse than this
roller blading.

960
00:54:16.479 --> 00:54:18.587
You don't look fine.

961
00:54:18.739 --> 00:54:22.165
Did the hospital prescribe
anything to you for the--

962
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.151
You know what, actually,
what about an ice pack?

963
00:54:24.169 --> 00:54:26.077
You need an ice pack right there
for the swelling.

964
00:54:26.171 --> 00:54:27.412
- (groaning)
- sorry, sorry.

965
00:54:27.431 --> 00:54:30.582
I'm okay. Look, ashley,
I owe you an apology.

966
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:32.751
Now that's the concussion
talking.

967
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.162
Ash, I need you to listen to me,
okay?

968
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.274
- Really listen.
- Okay.

969
00:54:38.425 --> 00:54:40.925
I had a lot of time to think
last night at the hospital

970
00:54:40.945 --> 00:54:43.337
Just lying there.

971
00:54:43.355 --> 00:54:46.523
I'm ashamed of the way I acted
with you.

972
00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:49.176
Fighting you,
getting the courts involved.

973
00:54:49.194 --> 00:54:51.453
It's the opposite
of what you are to me.

974
00:54:53.182 --> 00:54:54.123
I'm not your enemy.

975
00:54:56.276 --> 00:54:58.685
I don't want you to worry about
all that anymore, okay?

976
00:54:58.779 --> 00:55:01.446
You can keep the company name.

977
00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:05.301
It was yours to begin with,
anyway.

978
00:55:05.452 --> 00:55:08.620
That means a lot, roger.
Thank you.

979
00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:09.972
You're welcome.

980
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.383
So, did you see who did this?

981
00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:15.144
Sure I saw who did this.

982
00:55:15.295 --> 00:55:16.979
Not that I knew him,
or anything.

983
00:55:17.206 --> 00:55:20.316
- But he sure knew you.
- Knew me?

984
00:55:20.467 --> 00:55:22.151
He was acting crazy,

985
00:55:22.302 --> 00:55:24.044
He was asking me all these
questions about you.

986
00:55:24.137 --> 00:55:26.322
He said to tell you,
"marco is coming."

987
00:55:32.404 --> 00:55:33.495
Oh.

988
00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:36.165
Now she knows.

989
00:55:37.484 --> 00:55:39.242
What do you want, you psycho?

990
00:55:39.395 --> 00:55:41.411
Like there aren't enough
podcasts out there?

991
00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:44.231
- You and ashley are close?
- Like sisters.

992
00:55:44.249 --> 00:55:46.733
What do you want?

993
00:55:46.752 --> 00:55:48.993
I just want my life back.

994
00:55:49.088 --> 00:55:50.495
I want my livelihood back.

995
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:52.014
I want my reputation back.

996
00:55:54.668 --> 00:55:56.668
I wouldn't mind being able to
hold my head high

997
00:55:56.762 --> 00:55:58.929
In my hometown.

998
00:55:59.023 --> 00:56:01.081
Can you give that to me?

999
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.858
Did you have any of that
to begin with?

1000
00:56:05.421 --> 00:56:06.695
You know, they say a man's
reputation

1001
00:56:06.922 --> 00:56:10.107
Is the most important thing
he has.

1002
00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:12.759
More important than his words,
his deeds, it outshines us,

1003
00:56:12.778 --> 00:56:14.536
It lives on after he dies.

1004
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.806
I know this woman.
This is dorothy.

1005
00:56:37.377 --> 00:56:38.969
Why do you have this photo?

1006
00:56:39.063 --> 00:56:40.145
Book club.

1007
00:56:41.473 --> 00:56:42.398
(chuckling)

1008
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:44.474
You were plotting against me,
too?

1009
00:56:44.627 --> 00:56:46.143
Hmm?

1010
00:56:46.295 --> 00:56:48.478
You were trying to destroy me?

1011
00:56:48.631 --> 00:56:49.571
You were trying to--

1012
00:56:53.318 --> 00:56:56.561
You know, they say a woman's
reputation is her inner beauty.

1013
00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.230
God, could be anymore sexist?
What are you gonna do,

1014
00:56:59.324 --> 00:57:00.916
Spank me with a briefcase and--

1015
00:57:01.143 --> 00:57:02.659
(yelping)

1016
00:57:02.811 --> 00:57:04.494
I could destroy your reputation
the same way

1017
00:57:04.647 --> 00:57:06.088
You and ashley did mine.

1018
00:57:07.741 --> 00:57:09.758
(chuckling nervously)
oh my god.

1019
00:57:09.985 --> 00:57:12.577
All that time lying to her,
spying on her.

1020
00:57:12.596 --> 00:57:14.412
You're obsessed.

1021
00:57:14.432 --> 00:57:16.173
She's gotten under your skin,
so...

1022
00:57:16.325 --> 00:57:17.516
You should probably shut up now.

1023
00:57:22.831 --> 00:57:23.939
Okay.

1024
00:57:25.501 --> 00:57:27.350
Here's what we're gonna do.

1025
00:57:27.445 --> 00:57:28.527

1026
00:57:32.432 --> 00:57:33.449
Read that.

1027
00:57:40.458 --> 00:57:42.532
"my name is tess parks,
I've known ashley--"

1028
00:57:42.685 --> 00:57:43.959
Smile.

1029
00:57:45.521 --> 00:57:46.962
Smile!

1030
00:57:49.858 --> 00:57:53.135
"my name is tess parks,

1031
00:57:53.286 --> 00:57:55.971

1032
00:57:57.716 --> 00:58:01.368

master manipulator

1033
00:58:01.386 --> 00:58:05.147
"out to ruin the life
of every man she meets."

1034
00:58:06.709 --> 00:58:08.375
Okay.

1035
00:58:08.468 --> 00:58:11.228
Now what we're going to do

1036
00:58:11.322 --> 00:58:13.638
Is make a little video

1037
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:16.492
Where you are going to say that,

1038
00:58:16.643 --> 00:58:20.387
And you're going to tell the
whole world the truth

1039
00:58:20.405 --> 00:58:23.499
About the real ashley morris,
your best friend.

1040
00:58:33.085 --> 00:58:34.918
- (door creaking open)
- ashley: Tess?

1041
00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:36.327
You home?

1042
00:58:36.347 --> 00:58:37.495
(water running)

1043
00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:38.680
Tess?

1044
00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:41.683
(water running)

1045
00:58:53.088 --> 00:58:54.196
Ow.

1046
00:59:12.699 --> 00:59:14.365
Tess, I'm standing in
your kitchen

1047
00:59:14.459 --> 00:59:15.792
Wondering where the hell
you are.

1048
00:59:15.944 --> 00:59:17.386
Call me back, please.

1049
00:59:21.617 --> 00:59:22.558
(sighing)

1050
00:59:30.216 --> 00:59:32.976
(cell phone ringing)

1051
00:59:33.128 --> 00:59:34.978
Finally, I've been calling you
all morning.

1052
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:36.646
Where are you?

1053
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.906
Marco:
Ashley.

1054
00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.732
- Where is tess?
- (marco chuckling)

1055
00:59:47.826 --> 00:59:49.418
You think you could attack me
and I wouldn't defend myself?

1056
00:59:53.424 --> 00:59:55.498
What is this, revenge?

1057
00:59:55.651 --> 00:59:57.426
Is that why you're here?

1058
00:59:57.653 --> 00:59:59.177
This has nothing to do with
revenge.

1059
01:00:00.246 --> 01:00:01.988
Then what do you want, marco?

1060
01:00:02.082 --> 01:00:04.324
I want my reputation back!

1061
01:00:04.343 --> 01:00:07.102
I want you to publicly retract
all the lies you told about me.

1062
01:00:07.329 --> 01:00:09.420
I want everyone
to hear you confess.

1063
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.090
Reputation? How?

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:14.592
I can't, it's long gone.
I mean,

1065
01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.279
You can't put an explosion back
in the bomb, marco.

1066
01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.449
So there's no way to
convince you?

1067
01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:27.789
(muffled yelping)

1068
01:00:29.609 --> 01:00:31.710
- How about now?

1069
01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.115
Oh my god, tess!

1070
01:00:37.209 --> 01:00:38.783
No, no, no, no! Please!

1071
01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:41.136
What are you doing?
Let her go, marco!

1072
01:00:41.287 --> 01:00:44.197
She goes free the moment that
you admit publicly

1073
01:00:44.216 --> 01:00:46.032
That you lied about me.

1074
01:00:46.051 --> 01:00:47.458
(whimpering)

1075
01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:50.294
I can't! How would I do that?
I mean, it's not just me!

1076
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.039
What do you want me to do, like,
I'm not the only one

1077
01:00:53.058 --> 01:00:54.966
Telling my story. There are
hundreds of us out there.

1078
01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:56.393
Do you realize that?

1079
01:00:56.545 --> 01:00:59.637
Please let her go, please.
She's done nothing to you.

1080
01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:01.564
Marco: She helped destroy
my reputation!

1081
01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:04.326
She's done nothing?
She couldn't do anymore!

1082
01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:08.479
Ashley: I don't know what you
want from me, seriously.

1083
01:01:08.573 --> 01:01:10.907
I don't...
(whimpering)

1084
01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.651
Look, um,

1085
01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.170
I'll do what you want, okay?
I'll...

1086
01:01:15.397 --> 01:01:17.898
Just please don't hurt her,
okay?

1087
01:01:17.916 --> 01:01:20.583
Um, you want-- you want public
attention, that's what you want?

1088
01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:22.085
I'll do it, okay?

1089
01:01:22.237 --> 01:01:25.329
Um, maybe we can...

1090
01:01:25.424 --> 01:01:29.518
We can go somewhere together in
public for everyone to see.

1091
01:01:31.079 --> 01:01:32.187
What are you talking about?

1092
01:01:32.338 --> 01:01:35.691
Look, um,
the restaurant, okay?

1093
01:01:35.842 --> 01:01:38.601
They're having a grand opening
tomorrow night.

1094
01:01:38.754 --> 01:01:41.179
Okay, and we can go there
together,

1095
01:01:41.273 --> 01:01:43.532
Like a real date, okay?

1096
01:01:43.683 --> 01:01:45.183
And everyone will see
us together

1097
01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.927
And see what a gentleman
you are,

1098
01:01:46.945 --> 01:01:48.945
And that's what you want, right?
That's what...?

1099
01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.038
That's what...

1100
01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.693
No, you're trying to trick me.

1101
01:01:55.787 --> 01:01:58.788
You think that
I'm just some...

1102
01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.958
...Stupid little boy asking you
out for pie.

1103
01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.944
No, I'm not a fool, ashley.

1104
01:02:03.962 --> 01:02:04.961
(whimpering)

1105
01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.705
I swear, I will do it.
Please, I will.

1106
01:02:07.799 --> 01:02:10.726
I'm not lying, just promise me
you'll let her go, please.

1107
01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.065
Marco?

1108
01:02:21.296 --> 01:02:22.571
Marco?

1109
01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.407
Are you there?

1110
01:02:28.637 --> 01:02:29.986
Okay, okay.

1111
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.063
We'll do it your way.

1112
01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.641
But if I see even one cop there,
just one,

1113
01:02:34.659 --> 01:02:36.585
You will never see your friend
again.

1114
01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:42.591
So, how's tomorrow night at
eight o'clock?

1115
01:02:42.742 --> 01:02:44.843
Yeah, yeah, tomorrow night.
Eight o'clock, yeah.

(sobbing)

1117
01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.689
- Grant?
- Hey.

1118
01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:01.851
Are you okay?

1119
01:03:02.004 --> 01:03:03.670
- No.
- Come here.

1120
01:03:03.763 --> 01:03:05.688
No, I don't know what to do.

1121
01:03:05.841 --> 01:03:07.265
I don't know what to do.

1122
01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.784
- (crying)
- it's all right.

1123
01:03:08.935 --> 01:03:10.452
It's okay. It's okay.

1124
01:03:10.679 --> 01:03:13.013
Talk to me.

1125
01:03:13.031 --> 01:03:14.790
I know who's behind all
the break-ins.

1126
01:03:15.017 --> 01:03:16.699
He's been stalking me,
the guy I told you, marco,

1127
01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:17.700
The one I met online.

1128
01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.352
- It's him!
- Right.

1129
01:03:19.371 --> 01:03:22.188
And he's the one who attacked
roger, and now he has tess!

1130
01:03:22.207 --> 01:03:23.857
(stammers) w-what do you mean he
has tess?

1131
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:25.783
He just-- he took her!
He just took her.

1132
01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:27.118
He took her somewhere,
I don't know--

1133
01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.120
- I don't know where.
- Did you call the police?

1134
01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.714
No, I can't, I mean, he said
he'd hurt her if I do.

1135
01:03:31.867 --> 01:03:33.383
I don't know what to do.

1136
01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:37.220
He told me if I do anything,
he'll hurt her,

1137
01:03:37.372 --> 01:03:39.147
So I don't know if I should
call the cops,

1138
01:03:39.299 --> 01:03:40.557
I don't know if that's...
(sniffing)

1139
01:03:40.709 --> 01:03:42.892
This is all my fault.
I shouldn't have done this.

1140
01:03:43.045 --> 01:03:44.319
I shouldn't have gone after him
like that,

1141
01:03:44.546 --> 01:03:46.822
As if revenge was going to make
me feel better.

1142
01:03:47.049 --> 01:03:48.715
No, no, no,
it wasn't about revenge.

1143
01:03:48.808 --> 01:03:50.308
It was about justice, right?

1144
01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.053
We can't let people
do this to us,

1145
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:56.665
Use our trust against us
like that, right?

1146
01:03:56.892 --> 01:03:58.725
Yeah, but...

1147
01:03:58.743 --> 01:04:00.894
I mean, what have I done?

1148
01:04:00.987 --> 01:04:02.245

It all started the night
we went out for pie,

01:08:52.537 --> 01:08:54.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

1235
01:08:57.467 --> 01:08:59.300
Hello, welcome.
Thanks for coming.

1236
01:09:00.528 --> 01:09:01.636
(cell phone chiming)

1237
01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.432
Good evening,
we have you right over here.

1238
01:09:07.886 --> 01:09:17.986
♪

1239
01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.156
Ashley.

1240
01:09:22.734 --> 01:09:25.476
- Hi.
- In person, finally.

1241
01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:28.121
Wow, you look incredible.

1242
01:09:29.315 --> 01:09:30.415
Thank you.

1243
01:09:41.586 --> 01:09:44.587
Well, I'm here,

1244
01:09:44.681 --> 01:09:46.255
In public,

1245
01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:49.017
With you, for everyone to see.

1246
01:09:49.244 --> 01:09:51.093
So... Where's tess?

1247
01:09:51.246 --> 01:09:52.604
She's okay.

1248
01:09:54.933 --> 01:09:56.840
For now. The rest is up to you.

1249
01:09:56.935 --> 01:09:58.342
If you hurt her--

1250
01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.344
Don't be so pessimistic here.

1251
01:10:00.438 --> 01:10:02.346
Just give me your hand.

1252
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.365
- What?
- I said give me your hand.

1253
01:10:11.282 --> 01:10:12.498
Was that so hard?

1254
01:10:13.935 --> 01:10:15.501
You smell like cheap motel soap.

1255
01:10:22.368 --> 01:10:24.052
You're hurting me.

1256
01:10:34.639 --> 01:10:35.730
I'm just...

1257
01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.569
I was just trying to calm you.

1258
01:10:45.316 --> 01:10:46.649
Hey, fine. Whatever.

1259
01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.743
- Just...
- (liquid pouring)

1260
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.578
Pretend like you're
having fun.

1261
01:10:58.663 --> 01:10:59.754
To you.

1262
01:11:01.407 --> 01:11:05.242
- To me?
- Yeah.

1263
01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.744
(glasses clinking)

1264
01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.822
For showing me how naive I was

1265
01:11:09.841 --> 01:11:12.517
About how the world works.

1266
01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:17.830
- I showed you that?
- Yes, you did.

1267
01:11:17.849 --> 01:11:19.691
And so much more.

1268
01:11:22.687 --> 01:11:26.522
She is a ruthless liar and
master manipulator,

1269
01:11:26.674 --> 01:11:31.193
Out to ruin the life of every
man she meets.

1270
01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:33.955
My name is tess parks.

1271
01:11:34.106 --> 01:11:37.292
I've known ashley morris
a very long time.

1272
01:11:37.443 --> 01:11:39.368
(thudding at door)

1273
01:11:39.521 --> 01:11:41.537
...Ruthless liar and master
manipulator.

1274
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:43.781
- (thudding)
- (grunting)

1275
01:11:43.875 --> 01:11:46.467
- (whimpering)
- tess?

1276
01:11:46.694 --> 01:11:48.619
- How did you find me?
- Ashley did.

1277
01:11:48.713 --> 01:11:50.530
With some help.

1278
01:11:50.548 --> 01:11:52.365
(groaning)

1279
01:11:52.458 --> 01:11:53.474
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1280
01:11:53.626 --> 01:11:54.700
Yeah, is she okay?

1281
01:11:54.794 --> 01:11:57.036
Yeah, she's fine. She's fine.

1282
01:11:57.055 --> 01:11:58.813
I'll tell you more on the way.
Come on!

1283
01:12:06.047 --> 01:12:08.823
(soft jazz playing)

1284
01:12:11.069 --> 01:12:12.827
You don't like your wine?

1285
01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.573
Trying to keep my mind clear.

1286
01:12:17.725 --> 01:12:19.559
Hmm.

1287
01:12:19.652 --> 01:12:22.486
You haven't been on many dates,
have you, marco?

1288
01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:23.821
Well, I mean,

1289
01:12:23.915 --> 01:12:26.490
I seduce women for a living,
ashley.

1290
01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.901
"seduce." sure.

1291
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.754
I mean, any idiot can
seduce someone.

1292
01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:35.741
You just need to be shameless
enough to lie

1293
01:12:35.835 --> 01:12:37.927
And tell people what they
want to hear.

1294
01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:39.503
A pathetic grift.

1295
01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:43.082
I mean, it's not like you're
earning a person's respect,

1296
01:12:43.101 --> 01:12:45.585
Or having someone
fall in love with you

1297
01:12:45.603 --> 01:12:47.269
Or call you their friend.

1298
01:12:47.422 --> 01:12:50.940
You know, it requires empathy
and honesty

1299
01:12:51.092 --> 01:12:52.867
To build a rapport.

1300
01:12:53.018 --> 01:12:56.612
But unfortunately you're way too
scarred and too stunted

1301
01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.764
To make that connection.

1302
01:12:58.783 --> 01:13:00.524
Hmm.

1303
01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.126
Well, you would know.

1304
01:13:06.124 --> 01:13:08.674
Years of therapy trying to fix
that broken marriage.

1305
01:13:09.869 --> 01:13:11.777
The pills, the depression.

1306
01:13:11.871 --> 01:13:14.722
Blaming everybody around you.

1307
01:13:14.874 --> 01:13:18.041
Never taking the time to really
look inwards,

1308
01:13:18.136 --> 01:13:19.785
At the real problem.

1309
01:13:19.879 --> 01:13:22.397
I know you spoke to roger.

1310
01:13:22.548 --> 01:13:25.066
- I'm sure he told you plenty.
- Yeah, he did.

1311
01:13:25.293 --> 01:13:27.217
He told me the divorce really
took a toll on you

1312
01:13:27.311 --> 01:13:28.886
At the end there.

1313
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.571
You lost the car,
you lost the house,

1314
01:13:30.798 --> 01:13:32.982
You lost every one of your
friends, except for one.

1315
01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:34.650
Tess says hi by the way.

1316
01:13:34.802 --> 01:13:35.985
Go to hell, you creep.

1317
01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:37.578
Keep your voice down.

1318
01:13:40.825 --> 01:13:42.825
It scares you, doesn't it?

1319
01:13:42.977 --> 01:13:44.994
People staring at you.

1320
01:13:45.146 --> 01:13:47.380
- Laughing at you.
- Shut up.

1321
01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:52.668
You know what, you think you
can intimidate me?

1322
01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:56.931
I know everything about you?

1323
01:13:57.082 --> 01:14:00.935
All of your flaws.

1324
01:14:01.162 --> 01:14:03.187
You don't even know
my first name.

1325
01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:08.684
Oh, yeah?

1326
01:14:08.836 --> 01:14:11.020
But I do know your first name.

1327
01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.363
Nicholas.

1328
01:14:16.344 --> 01:14:17.193
How?

1329
01:14:17.345 --> 01:14:20.196
Maybe I've done
some digging too.

1330
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.198
Nicholas boczek.

1331
01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:25.701
Born January 23rd, 1982,

1332
01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:27.778
In a town called red bank
in new jersey--

1333
01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.089
- (cutlery clanging)
- shut up!

1334
01:14:33.303 --> 01:14:34.802
(whispering)
I'll kill you.

1335
01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.056
You'll kill me?

1336
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:41.934
Okay.

1337
01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.606
Are you going to kill us all?

1338
01:14:54.065 --> 01:14:55.907
And what is this?

1339
01:14:58.477 --> 01:15:01.996
This is your legacy, nicholas.

1340
01:15:02.223 --> 01:15:04.390
All your conquests.

1341
01:15:04.483 --> 01:15:06.892
Here to meet the real you!

1342
01:15:06.911 --> 01:15:09.003
Well, the ones who were able
to make it here

1343
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:11.339
On such short notice,
of course.

1344
01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:15.009
The many, many others
send their coldest regards.

1345
01:15:16.495 --> 01:15:18.095
So, what, you guys
started a club?

1346
01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.683
You guys-- do you guys meet
every Sunday night

1347
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:26.479
And bad mouth the man who
broke your heart?

1348
01:15:28.266 --> 01:15:29.190
This is not funny.

1349
01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:34.511
Dorothy, you let her rope you
into this? Come on.

1350
01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:36.422
How are the grandkids,
by the way?

1351
01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.699
- Bite me, thomas.
- Hey.

1352
01:15:41.429 --> 01:15:44.038
So this is how you think
you're gonna win? Hmm.

1353
01:15:44.265 --> 01:15:46.832
Ashley, I will make tess
disappear.

1354
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.103
We've already won, nicky.

1355
01:15:51.196 --> 01:15:52.955
Do you realize where you are?

1356
01:15:53.107 --> 01:15:56.625
We're in a room with you
where you have no control.

1357
01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.295
Where we get a good laugh at you

1358
01:15:59.389 --> 01:16:01.847
The way you've been laughing
at us this whole time.

1359
01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:07.061
Whatever. I'll just disappear.

1360
01:16:07.288 --> 01:16:09.230
There's a new site,

1361
01:16:09.457 --> 01:16:11.307
There's a new face, there's
a new name.

1362
01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:15.052
Maybe I'll date one of your
daughters in the future, hmm?

1363
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:17.888
Or a lonely niece, so you guys
can all get together

1364
01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:21.224
And exchange sob stories.
Just the gals.

1365
01:16:21.319 --> 01:16:23.319
You think this is a joke?

1366
01:16:23.413 --> 01:16:25.162
You're not gonna be able to do
any of that.

1367
01:16:27.642 --> 01:16:32.235
You see, you managed to dupe a
very interesting group of women.

1368
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:35.314
Clarissa, for instance,

1369
01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:39.335
She's spent over 12 years,
working for one of

1370
01:16:39.487 --> 01:16:43.155
The most respected forensic
accounting firms in the state,

1371
01:16:43.174 --> 01:16:47.918
And boy, they are savage when it
comes to tracking wire fraud.

1372
01:16:48.012 --> 01:16:52.607
And indra, well, let's just say
she knows a few folks

1373
01:16:52.758 --> 01:16:55.926
Who just love a good excuse
to doxx a scammer.

1374
01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:58.020
Great profile password,
by the way.

1375
01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:00.281
"hot lady slayer 85."

1376
01:17:00.432 --> 01:17:01.841
Hilarious.

1377
01:17:01.934 --> 01:17:05.344
I mean, with the amount of
talent standing in this room,

1378
01:17:05.363 --> 01:17:08.030
I'll be shocked if you're able
to show your face

1379
01:17:08.182 --> 01:17:11.033
On any social media platform
ever again.

1380
01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.352
That's, of course, if you're not
already on your way to jail

1381
01:17:13.371 --> 01:17:15.046
For kidnapping and assault.

1382
01:17:22.196 --> 01:17:25.288
You let me go or tess rots.

1383
01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:28.050
Tess, right. That reminds me.

1384
01:17:28.202 --> 01:17:30.369
Do you remember nancy?

1385
01:17:30.388 --> 01:17:31.887
Yeah, you probably don't,

1386
01:17:32.039 --> 01:17:34.223
Because it's been almost two
years since you broke her heart

1387
01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:37.376
And stole her life savings.

1388
01:17:37.395 --> 01:17:40.229
Well, nancy is now a manager
at parkway motels.

1389
01:17:40.381 --> 01:17:42.064
Ever heard of them?

1390
01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.474
Did you know they actually take
a digital snapshot

1391
01:17:44.494 --> 01:17:46.402
Of every single one of
their guests?

1392
01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:48.245
For security purposes.

1393
01:17:53.411 --> 01:17:55.728
It's over, nicholas.

1394
01:17:55.746 --> 01:17:58.839
You're not going to fool or hurt
anyone else again.

1395
01:18:01.085 --> 01:18:02.067
Officer:
Him right there!

1396
01:18:02.086 --> 01:18:08.908
♪

1397
01:18:08.926 --> 01:18:10.075
Back up or I'll kill her.

1398
01:18:10.094 --> 01:18:12.594
Ashley.

1399
01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:14.747
Woman: You can't run, nicholas.
You're surrounded.

1400
01:18:14.765 --> 01:18:16.506
- Just let her go.
- My name is not nicholas.

1401
01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:19.026
It's marco,
stop calling me that,

1402
01:18:19.178 --> 01:18:20.695
And back the hell up!

1403
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.015
Grant: Ashley,
do what he says, okay?

1404
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:27.017
Ashley, just stay calm, okay?
We're coming to get you.

1405
01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.370
We're coming to get you.
Just stay calm.

1406
01:18:29.597 --> 01:18:30.955
