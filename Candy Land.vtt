No, just a normal Tuesday, Rex.

154
00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:31.546

155

Don't you fuck with me, Riley.

159
00:14:09.517 --> 00:14:11.519
Nora, what the fuck
is wrong with him?

160
00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.390
I was peeing.

161
00:14:16.423 --> 00:14:18.058
I got my period.

162
00:14:18.092 --> 00:14:20.894
I bought a tampon, and he was
just fucking dead like that

163
00:14:20.928 --> 00:14:21.629

164
00:14:23.364 --> 00:14:24.365

165
00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:29.637

166
00:14:32.507 --> 00:14:33.374
She didn't do it.

167
00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.276
What, did you have
a fucking hunch?

168
00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:43.651
There's my hunch.

169
00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:45.285
Oh.

170
00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:47.221
Look, I'd love for
it to be that cunt

171
00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:49.356
more than anybody else,
and you know that.

172
00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:51.492
But she ain't good for nothing

173
00:14:51.526 --> 00:14:53.260
but giving mango cakes.

174
00:14:56.531 --> 00:14:57.331
She ain't no killer.

175
00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:01.101
What do we do now?

176
00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:02.670
Nothing.

177
00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.407
They took the body,
bring it to the morgue,

178
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.041
bury it in a few days.

179
00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:12.980
Life goes on, Nora.

180
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:15.916
Who was he?

181
00:15:17.117 --> 00:15:18.586
Who fucking cares?

182
00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:32.266
How's Riley?

183
00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:33.167
She's fine.

184
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.235
I think she just needs
to be left alone.

185
00:15:36.504 --> 00:15:37.337
Who's this?

186
00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:40.073
She's from that weirdo cult,

187
00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.476
the 13 somethings.

188
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.212
My cousin went to
a few of their meetings.

189
00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:47.448
They think they're
gonna leave for Heaven

190
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.584
before the rest of us.

191
00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:53.588
So what are you doing here?

192
00:15:56.591 --> 00:15:58.560
They made her leave, I think.

193
00:15:58.593 --> 00:15:59.527
I don't know.

194
00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:00.762
I just didn't think it was safe

195
00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:03.230
to let her stay
at the stop alone,

196
00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:05.199
especially after what happened.

197
00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:06.333
Hm.

198
00:16:07.669 --> 00:16:09.136
Okay, who's got
something for me?

199
00:16:09.537 --> 00:16:10.404
On the TV.

200
00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:11.673
Yeah, mine's there too.

201
00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:16.009
Okay.

202
00:16:16.043 --> 00:16:16.678
Night.

203
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.799
Hey.

204
00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:39.099
Hey, pumpkin.

205
00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.403
You snored.

206
00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:44.572
Yeah, you too.

207
00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:52.379
Levi.

208
00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:56.450
Hey. Let's go eat.

209
00:16:57.685 --> 00:16:59.754
All right, give me a second.

210
00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:02.389
Yo, Riley!

211
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.391
Let's go eat.

212
00:17:05.392 --> 00:17:06.528
Go away.

213
00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:09.496
Mm-mm.

214
00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:19.306
All right, so we got
root beer for Sadie,

215
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.174
- Sprite for Livy.
- Thank you, baby.

216
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.175
And Coke for Remy.

217
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.077
- Thank you.
- No problem.

218
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:26.113
You're gonna let me
order for you, right?

219
00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:27.347
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

220
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.249
You ever had a Coney?

221
00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:31.184
No. What is it?

222
00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:32.787
She's never had a coney!

223
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.422
It's like, uh, it's like
a hot dog, pretty much.

224
00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:37.291
Okay.

225
00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:40.093
You've had a hot dog, yeah?

226
00:17:41.863 --> 00:17:43.565
No fucking way!

227
00:17:43.598 --> 00:17:46.601
Okay, uh, it's like a sausage.

228
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:49.303
You're gonna like 'em.

229
00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:51.204
But my grandfather
once, in under an hour,

230
00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:52.507
ate 21 of them bad boys.

231
00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.775
- Oh, here we go.
- No, no, no. He did, he did.

232
00:17:53.808 --> 00:17:55.777
Yeah, he did, and they put his
plaque on the wall over there

233
00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.445
- Oh, really?
- Yes! He did. For years.

234
00:17:58.478 --> 00:17:59.279
Oh, yeah?

235
00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:00.113
Mm-hm.

236
00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:01.583
What happened to him?

237
00:18:01.616 --> 00:18:03.518
I mean, he died, like everybody.

238
00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:06.386
I'm sorry.

239
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.421
It's okay.

240
00:18:11.726 --> 00:18:13.828
So how long have
you worn this getup?

241
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.430
Since I was a girl.

242
00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:19.499
How long have you worked
at the truck stop?

243
00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:21.703
For a little while.

244
00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:28.676
What?

245
00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:31.546
Nothing.

246
00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:33.581
Come on, say it. What is it?

247
00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:36.249
Just, how can you...

248
00:18:37.585 --> 00:18:39.419
how could you do that?

249
00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:43.658
I hate that question.

250
00:18:43.691 --> 00:18:44.692
I'm sorry, I don't...

251
00:18:44.726 --> 00:18:46.594
No, it's okay.

252
00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:48.228
I don't think too much about it.

253
00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:50.364
It's just a way to make
some money for now.

254
00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:53.467
You?

255
00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:55.637
I mean, you don't
think I've worked a job

256
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.771
for six bucks an hour?

257
00:18:57.972 --> 00:18:58.806
I've done that.

258
00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:03.578
Turn one trick, make a
whole day's pay, you know?

259
00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:07.147
It's kind of hard to
go back after that.

260
00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:10.585
I just like to party.

261
00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.754
- Slut.
- You know,

262
00:19:12.787 --> 00:19:15.288
you make a little dough.
It's not a bad gig.

263
00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:16.456
But you're gay.

264
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.125
No.

265
00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:19.661
You know, I can blow the horn,

266
00:19:19.694 --> 00:19:22.429
but, well, I like ladies too.

267
00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:24.565
We're together.

268
00:19:25.633 --> 00:19:29.436
But it's, you know,
it's whatever.

269
00:19:32.774 --> 00:19:33.875
What about you, Remy?

270
00:19:33.908 --> 00:19:34.809
What do you wanna do?

271
00:19:39.647 --> 00:19:40.480
I don't know.

272
00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:43.316
Are you gonna go home?

273
00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:47.922
I can't go home.

274
00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:48.790
Why not?

275
00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:51.993
I just can't.

276
00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.861
Okay? I can't go back.

277
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.804
So I got someone coming over.

278
00:20:02.837 --> 00:20:04.371
You're gonna have to
wait outside the room

279
00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:06.373
for a little bit, okay?

280
00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:07.240
Okay.

281
00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:13.014
You know, I can talk to Nora

282
00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:18.218
and probably get her to let
you stay another couple days

283
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.455
while you figure out
what you wanna do.

284
00:20:22.857 --> 00:20:23.691
Thank you.

285
00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:25.593
All right.

286
00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:27.595
I'll make it quick.

287
00:20:52.887 --> 00:20:54.421
Hey.

288
00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:56.023
Hey, baby.

289
00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:12.940
Still here, huh?

290
00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:19.680
Why don't you come wait inside.

291
00:21:19.714 --> 00:21:22.650
It's okay. I like it out here.

292
00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:23.551
Thank you, though.

293
00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:26.521
Oh, come on.

294
00:21:26.554 --> 00:21:29.023
They don't like you hanging
out out here anyway.

295
00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:30.725
Come on. I'll make some tea.

296
00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:41.702
You're so pretty.

297
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.839
People must say that
to you all the time.

298
00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:48.709
They don't?

299
00:21:48.743 --> 00:21:51.045
Well, then you are hanging
out with the wrong people.

300
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:55.716
Sadie's a nice girl, huh?

301
00:21:57.718 --> 00:21:59.854
Yeah. She's really nice.

302
00:21:59.887 --> 00:22:01.889
They're all really good kids.

303
00:22:01.923 --> 00:22:03.057
And they take care of
each other, you know?

304
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.692
'Cause it's rough out there.

305
00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:08.896
And it's nice to have
someone who has your back.

306
00:22:12.133 --> 00:22:13.801
But we have a rule.

307
00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:16.504
You stay, you work.

308
00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:18.371
But if you work, we
take care of you.

309
00:22:23.878 --> 00:22:26.814
Hey, don't be so nervous.

310
00:22:26.848 --> 00:22:27.748
I'm not gonna hurt you.

311
00:22:29.917 --> 00:22:31.085
So what do you think?

312
00:22:31.118 --> 00:22:32.787
You think you wanna stay
with us for a while?

313
00:22:36.591 --> 00:22:37.424
Good.

314
00:22:41.596 --> 00:22:42.462
Stand up for me.

315
00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:48.836
Look at you.

316
00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:54.976
Where do they even
get these dresses?

317
00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:56.911
Where is that store?

318
00:22:56.944 --> 00:22:58.813
I mean, is it like
a pioneer thing?

319
00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:00.181
It's so pervy.

320
00:23:10.725 --> 00:23:11.859
Don't be ashamed.

321
00:23:15.897 --> 00:23:17.098
You really are an angel.

322
00:23:22.904 --> 00:23:25.873
I have to ask, have you ever
even kissed someone before?

323
00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:28.408
No.

324
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.991
Not so bad, huh?

325
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:52.199
So, this whole lot is exit 17.

326
00:23:52.233 --> 00:23:54.835
There's three stops
like ours on route 66,

327
00:23:54.869 --> 00:23:55.870
but if you're heading west,

328
00:23:55.903 --> 00:23:58.940
this is the last stop
for any quality action.

329
00:23:58.973 --> 00:24:00.574
If you wanna unbuckle
the bible belt,

330
00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:01.876
this is the place to do it.

331
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:06.580
Good, clean, old-fashioned,
drug-free pussy.

332
00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:07.815
And dick.

333
00:24:07.848 --> 00:24:09.750
We have a bit of
a reputation here,

334
00:24:09.784 --> 00:24:10.685
and we're so proud of it.

335
00:24:10.718 --> 00:24:12.720
Hey, you know, Riley's mom,

336
00:24:12.753 --> 00:24:14.522
she worked exit 17.

337
00:24:14.555 --> 00:24:17.191
Gave it the nickname,
too. Candy Land.

338
00:24:17.224 --> 00:24:19.226
So there's four parts.

339
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.862
<i>The pit. Think of it
as a neighborhood.</i>

340
00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:23.965
Yeah, you'd never just
walk up to any old house

341
00:24:23.998 --> 00:24:25.733
and knock on the door
at 3:00 AM and be like,

342
00:24:25.766 --> 00:24:28.069
"Hey, how's it going? You
want your cock sucked?"

343
00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:29.737
There's rules.

344
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.906
If someone wants company,
they'll let you know.

345
00:24:33.207 --> 00:24:36.077
<i>The first is simple,
back-in parking.</i>

346
00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:39.914
<i>Next is more of the same,</i>

347
00:24:39.947 --> 00:24:41.082
if they flash their lights.

348
00:24:42.216 --> 00:24:44.118
Remember, they're
watching for you too.

349
00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:47.855
Next is the bathroom
cruisers. Levi?

350
00:24:47.888 --> 00:24:50.057
So your bathrooms are for
your thrill seekers, you know,

351
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:53.060
not just about getting off,
but about not getting caught.

352
00:24:53.094 --> 00:24:54.895
<i>Stalls around here
are most active</i>

353
00:24:54.929 --> 00:24:56.731
<i>in the afternoon
and the evening.</i>

354
00:24:56.764 --> 00:25:00.001
<i>I usually post up in the stall
at the end, against the wall.</i>

355
00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:00.801
<i>When someone comes in,</i>

356
00:25:01.969 --> 00:25:04.005
<i>you can tell a lot by
their body language.</i>

357
00:25:04.038 --> 00:25:05.773
<i>Do they go straight
to take a piss?</i>

358
00:25:07.008 --> 00:25:08.976
<i>Do they bust through the
door and take a shit?</i>

359
00:25:11.645 --> 00:25:12.980
<i>Or do they come in casually?</i>

360
00:25:14.648 --> 00:25:17.184
<i>And if they do, I
start to tap my foot.</i>

361
00:25:20.788 --> 00:25:24.725
<i>If they tap back,
then it's game on.</i>

362
00:25:25.926 --> 00:25:27.061
You know, and a lot of
these cats are not truckers.

363
00:25:27.094 --> 00:25:29.130
They're married men,
and proud of it too.

364
00:25:29.163 --> 00:25:30.931
They're just looking
for a little excitement.

365
00:25:32.033 --> 00:25:33.701
Who's that?

366
00:25:33.734 --> 00:25:36.137
That's Rex. Don't
worry about him.

367
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.038
Not unless you're Levi.

368
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.706
Mm-hm.

369
00:25:38.739 --> 00:25:40.007
Babe, the radio.

370
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:40.908
Right. Go.

371
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:42.777
So we use these.

372
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.748
<i>We're listening
for our code words,</i>

373
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:50.584
<i>commercial company,</i>

374
00:25:50.618 --> 00:25:54.121
<i>angels on the
airwaves, lot lizards,</i>

375
00:25:54.155 --> 00:25:58.059
<i>or anyone who says they're
headed for Candy Land.</i>

376
00:25:58.092 --> 00:26:00.027
<i>I-9, this is Hot-Karl</i>

377
00:26:00.061 --> 00:26:01.595
<i>heading for Candy Land.</i>

378
00:26:01.629 --> 00:26:03.064
<i>Any lizards running today?</i>

379
00:26:05.166 --> 00:26:06.200
33.

380
00:26:06.233 --> 00:26:07.768
<i>So once they put out the signal,</i>

381
00:26:07.802 --> 00:26:10.004
<i>we have 'em flip over
to a private channel,</i>

382
00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:11.705
<i>and there, we make plans.</i>

383
00:26:12.807 --> 00:26:15.609
Hot-Karl, what did
you have in mind?

384
00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:22.316
<i>And no matter what,
you always use one of these.</i>

385
00:26:22.349 --> 00:26:25.686
They'll beg you not to, but
don't be stupid like Levi.

386
00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:27.955
Or for an extra 40
bucks, you can always

387
00:26:27.988 --> 00:26:28.989
- ride bare back.
- Stop.

388
00:26:29.023 --> 00:26:31.058
- Do not listen to him.
- It's...

389
00:26:31.092 --> 00:26:32.793
So what do you think? You ready?

390
00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:34.895
Wait, now?

391
00:26:34.929 --> 00:26:36.163
No, I'm kidding.

392
00:26:36.197 --> 00:26:38.099
Relax, we're not
gonna start you here.

393
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.939
So, this is your room.

394
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.808
Liv was nice enough
to move in with Sadie

395
00:26:47.842 --> 00:26:49.877
so that you could
have it for yourself.

396
00:26:51.378 --> 00:26:53.814
Do whatever you want with
it. Make it your own.

397
00:26:54.748 --> 00:26:56.317
And I got you something.

398
00:26:59.153 --> 00:27:00.955
Why don't you try it on.

399
00:27:00.988 --> 00:27:03.157
We'll let you get settled.

400
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:30.945
Wow. You look like a real woman.

401
00:28:41.088 --> 00:28:41.922
How do you feel?

402
00:28:43.123 --> 00:28:44.792
I feel okay.

403
00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:46.227
Great. I'm so glad to hear it.

404
00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:49.330
We have a guy coming to see you.

405
00:28:49.363 --> 00:28:50.764
He's a really nice man.

406
00:28:50.798 --> 00:28:53.100
He's super gentle.

407
00:28:53.133 --> 00:28:54.835
We don't let guys
in here who aren't,

408
00:28:54.868 --> 00:28:56.303
you know, people we trust.

409
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.976
It is okay to be a
little nervous and shy.

410
00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:03.344
That's fine. It's normal.

411
00:29:05.346 --> 00:29:09.483
But I know that
deep down inside,

412
00:29:09.517 --> 00:29:12.319
there's a woman who
is dying to come out.

413
00:29:12.353 --> 00:29:14.221
So don't be afraid
to enjoy yourself.

414
00:29:15.322 --> 00:29:17.157
You're gonna be great.

415
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:19.093
And you know I'll
be right next door,

416
00:29:20.027 --> 00:29:21.529
so just knock if you need me.

417
00:29:22.963 --> 00:29:24.131
Okay.

418
00:29:33.073 --> 00:29:34.275
You a Goodbuddy?

419
00:29:34.308 --> 00:29:35.476
Sure am.

420
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.244
I'm looking for a little... fun.

421
00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:40.147
All right. Well,
what you looking for?

422
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.315
What's on the menu?

423
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.085
Well, we've got 40,

424
00:29:47.187 --> 00:29:47.988
60,

425
00:29:49.524 --> 00:29:50.357
and 80.

426
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.228
Fine as you are,

427
00:29:54.261 --> 00:29:56.297
I'd hate myself not saying 80.

428
00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:01.368
Well, you wanna slide in the
back and let me join you?

429
00:30:01.402 --> 00:30:03.470
It's a little,
uh, tight in here.

430
00:30:03.505 --> 00:30:07.007
Why don't we, uh,
go back over there,

431
00:30:07.041 --> 00:30:08.409
someplace quiet.

432
00:30:25.092 --> 00:30:26.393
All right, here work?

433
00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:28.329
Yeah.

434
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.101
Then what are you waiting for?

435
00:30:34.134 --> 00:30:35.503
You gonna whip that thing out?

436
00:30:35.537 --> 00:30:37.237
Why don't you
come help me with it.

437
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.473
Okay.

438
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.344
You fucking make a sound,

439
00:31:17.378 --> 00:31:20.214
I'm gonna slit your
fucking throat.

440
00:31:20.247 --> 00:31:21.482
Do you understand me?

441
00:31:21.516 --> 00:31:22.182
Yes.

442
00:31:22.216 --> 00:31:23.417
You understand me?

443
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.552
Yes, yes, yes!

444
00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:48.135
Hi, there.

445
00:32:49.203 --> 00:32:50.037
May I come in?

446
00:33:19.501 --> 00:33:21.669
My name's Father Phillip.

447
00:33:21.703 --> 00:33:22.504
What's your name?

448
00:33:24.572 --> 00:33:25.540
Remy.

449
00:33:25.573 --> 00:33:26.574
Remy?

450
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:28.710
I hear you're a Christian.

451
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.145
How cool is that? So am I.

452
00:33:33.815 --> 00:33:36.116
Do you say your prayers
every night, Remy?

453
00:33:37.719 --> 00:33:38.753
Yes.

454
00:33:38.786 --> 00:33:40.187
That's good.

455
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.489
You can never get too
old to say your prayers.

456
00:33:43.423 --> 00:33:44.726
May I take a seat next to you?

457
00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:03.578
My gosh.

458
00:34:05.747 --> 00:34:08.616
You are so beautiful.

459
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:16.791
They told me, but I had no idea.

460
00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:20.460
I rushed over here to meet you.

461
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:25.198
Oh, you don't have to be scared.

462
00:34:26.634 --> 00:34:29.369
I couldn't hurt a fly.

463
00:34:33.473 --> 00:34:35.510
Is there something
I can do for you?

464
00:34:36.611 --> 00:34:38.378
Oh, you're so sweet.

465
00:34:39.246 --> 00:34:41.315
What if I did something for you?

466
00:34:41.348 --> 00:34:42.617
How would you like that?

467
00:34:52.827 --> 00:34:54.328
Okay.

468
00:34:54.361 --> 00:34:54.996
Great.

469
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:58.866
Well, why don't you lay back.

470
00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:07.274
There you go.

471
00:36:01.996 --> 00:36:03.665
Oh, yes.

472
00:36:03.698 --> 00:36:04.699
Oh, yeah.

473
00:36:06.734 --> 00:36:07.769
Oh, Lord.

474
00:36:07.802 --> 00:36:09.570
Yeah.

475
00:36:09.604 --> 00:36:10.838
I ask for your forgiveness.

476
00:36:10.872 --> 00:36:12.874
Yeah.

477
00:36:15.308 --> 00:36:15.977
Cleanse me.

478
00:36:18.546 --> 00:36:19.914
I receive your grace.

479
00:36:22.984 --> 00:36:25.285
I accept your forgiveness

480
00:36:27.387 --> 00:36:28.623
and your sacrifice

481
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:34.896
to pay my debt.

482
00:36:37.965 --> 00:36:38.866
Cleanse me.

483
00:36:43.738 --> 00:36:45.439
Cleanse me.

484
00:36:54.381 --> 00:36:55.215
Amen.

485
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.694
Hold on.

486
00:38:19.767 --> 00:38:20.668
You okay?

487
00:38:21.769 --> 00:38:22.603
Yeah.

488
00:38:23.571 --> 00:38:24.505
Come here.

489
00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:25.740
It's all right.

490
00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:27.307
It's over, okay?

491
00:38:29.544 --> 00:38:34.549
♪ Happy V-Day to you ♪

492
00:38:35.116 --> 00:38:39.587

495
00:38:50.665 --> 00:38:51.732
What is this?

496
00:38:51.766 --> 00:38:52.867
It's a cherry cupcake,

497
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.635
for the girl who
just lost her cherry.

498
00:38:54.669 --> 00:38:55.970
Oh, yeah. Blow it out.

499
00:38:59.707 --> 00:39:00.942
This looks really good.

500
00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:11.719
Levi?

501
00:39:15.156 --> 00:39:17.592
Levi, what happened to you?

502
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.928
Baby, what happened?

503
00:39:34.575 --> 00:39:35.710
Barely nicked you.

504
00:39:37.845 --> 00:39:38.946
You got lucky, kiddo.

505
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.652
You'll be all right.

506
00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:46.921
Give him a little Bactroban.

507
00:39:46.954 --> 00:39:48.421
I'm just glad you're okay.

508
00:39:50.024 --> 00:39:51.458
So what do you think?

509
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:53.027
You think it was the same
guy from the bathroom?

510
00:39:55.229 --> 00:39:56.463
Stands to reason.

511
00:39:58.566 --> 00:40:01.068
He did say he'd
carve my throat up.

512
00:40:01.102 --> 00:40:02.637
Seemed like his thing too.

513
00:40:07.642 --> 00:40:08.475
Hey.

514
00:40:17.919 --> 00:40:18.920
How's your back end?

515
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.825
Why, just swell, Rex.

516
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.864
Thanks.

517
00:40:33.901 --> 00:40:35.903
So what now? Are you
gonna call it in?

518
00:40:37.905 --> 00:40:38.873
You sure he's cooked?

519
00:40:41.609 --> 00:40:42.710
You don't wanna call
this kind of thing in,

520
00:40:42.743 --> 00:40:46.547
it just creates more problems,
more eyes on the lot.

521
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.949
You got the same son of a bitch

522
00:40:47.982 --> 00:40:50.718
that carved up
our bathroom John,

523
00:40:50.751 --> 00:40:53.688
and I'll bet dollars
to donuts it is,

524
00:40:53.721 --> 00:40:57.959
then you did a
great thing, Levi.

525
00:41:00.995 --> 00:41:02.163
You did a real great thing.

526
00:41:04.298 --> 00:41:05.967
Now we just gotta clean it up.

527
00:41:14.642 --> 00:41:16.711
Fuck.

528
00:41:20.881 --> 00:41:22.850
Face looks like scrambled eggs.

529
00:41:25.019 --> 00:41:26.554
You weren't fucking around.

530
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:29.523
Yeah, what was I supposed to do?

531
00:41:29.557 --> 00:41:30.791
Well, what could you do?

532
00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:33.294
You got nothing to
worry about, Levi.

533
00:41:33.327 --> 00:41:35.730
No one's gonna come
looking for this psycho.

534
00:41:39.033 --> 00:41:40.167
Why don't you grab his feet.

535
00:41:59.754 --> 00:42:00.921
I'm glad you're okay, Levi.

536
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:10.598
I'm glad you're not hurt.

537
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.300
Thanks, Rex.

538
00:42:19.073 --> 00:42:21.042
I care about you, Levi.

539
00:42:27.048 --> 00:42:28.649
I've got feelings for you.

540
00:42:37.191 --> 00:42:38.025
Okay.

541
00:42:45.132 --> 00:42:46.934
Claudia's a good woman.

542
00:42:48.235 --> 00:42:51.972
Cooks, cleans, knows when to
keep her fucking mouth shut.

543
00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.112
But she just doesn't
have that wow factor.

544
00:43:02.049 --> 00:43:03.584
You wow me every time, son.

545
00:43:06.253 --> 00:43:07.688
Every time.

546
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:09.290
What the fuck are you doing?!

547
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:12.726
Kiss me.

548
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.628
Rex, stop! No, not tonight!

549
00:43:14.662 --> 00:43:15.996
Not tonight, no!

550
00:43:18.999 --> 00:43:19.934
I just thought...

551
00:43:21.202 --> 00:43:22.036
What do you mean
what am I doing?

552
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:23.737
- What are...
- What...

553
00:43:26.807 --> 00:43:29.110
Can we, can we please just...

554
00:43:29.977 --> 00:43:30.911
Fuck you!

555
00:43:34.248 --> 00:43:35.249
Please, can we please just go

556
00:43:35.282 --> 00:43:36.851
move the body, please?

557
00:43:36.884 --> 00:43:38.185
- Please?
- Fuck you.

558
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:44.959
All right, just, just, let's go.

559
00:43:44.992 --> 00:43:46.026
Can we go?

560
00:43:54.468 --> 00:43:57.138
You've got some fucking nerve.

561
00:43:59.206 --> 00:44:04.211
♪ So tender and mild ♪

562
00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.283
♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪

563
00:44:19.493 --> 00:44:24.698
♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪

564
00:44:38.412 --> 00:44:39.246
Go away.

565
00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:45.186
What the fuck?

566
00:44:46.854 --> 00:44:48.422
God damn it.

567
00:44:48.455 --> 00:44:49.456
Sadie!

568
00:44:55.763 --> 00:44:57.031
Hi.

569
00:44:57.064 --> 00:44:58.265
Turn around, Jonah.

570
00:44:59.266 --> 00:45:00.434
I remember you.

571
00:45:01.936 --> 00:45:03.871
Did you come to
show me that cock?

572
00:45:03.904 --> 00:45:05.239
Take me to God's kingdom?

573
00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.341
We're here to see Remy.

574
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:14.949
You okay?

575
00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.284
Yeah, I'm okay.

576
00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:22.256
It's okay, I'll
meet you over there.

577
00:45:37.204 --> 00:45:39.240
Would you like
to put on some clothes?

578
00:45:51.952 --> 00:45:52.786
Psst.

579
00:45:53.854 --> 00:45:54.888
Hey, cutie.

580
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.295
What are you doing here, Theo?

581
00:46:02.597 --> 00:46:05.165
I could ask you the
same thing, but I won't.

582
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:08.068
I didn't ask to withdraw.

583
00:46:16.043 --> 00:46:20.014
I want you to try
and hear me, okay?

584
00:46:21.348 --> 00:46:24.852
Your mind has been poisoned,

585
00:46:27.354 --> 00:46:28.956
and I know it is not your fault.

586
00:46:28.989 --> 00:46:31.191
I recognize that, I do.

587
00:46:33.494 --> 00:46:35.929
Your mother and her beliefs,

588
00:46:35.963 --> 00:46:38.499
they were not that of the
apostles, but of her own.

589
00:46:40.301 --> 00:46:41.603
She instilled them into you,

590
00:46:41.636 --> 00:46:43.538
and I need you to see that.

591
00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:46.574
That is why you were
asked to withdraw.

592
00:46:49.076 --> 00:46:52.580
Theo, my mother
taught you how to see,

593
00:46:52.614 --> 00:46:54.381
and you turned on her.

594
00:46:54.415 --> 00:46:56.551
I did not turn on her, Remy.

595
00:46:56.584 --> 00:46:58.218
- Yes, you did.
- I did not.

596
00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:02.389
She became ill, Remy.

597
00:47:03.924 --> 00:47:05.392
Ill.

598
00:47:05.426 --> 00:47:09.263
And when that happened, she
changed. Her mind changed.

599
00:47:12.066 --> 00:47:14.201
She became barbaric,

600
00:47:14.234 --> 00:47:16.403
with no mercy for
the dissenters.

601
00:47:18.038 --> 00:47:20.341
Now I've made peace with
her since she left us,

602
00:47:20.374 --> 00:47:22.577
and I am grateful for the
life that she showed me,

603
00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.846
and that is why I feel I
owe the same debt to you.

604
00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:34.088
We are not here to cleanse
the dissenters of the world.

605
00:47:34.522 --> 00:47:39.259
We are here to cleanse
ourselves of this world,

606
00:47:41.095 --> 00:47:43.931
and when we are cleansed,
then we will leave it.

607
00:47:49.436 --> 00:47:50.371
Theo.

608
00:47:52.306 --> 00:47:56.511
Your mind has
always been so small.

609
00:47:58.546 --> 00:48:02.416
Ye shall tear down
their altars, Theo,

610
00:48:03.585 --> 00:48:06.487
rip down their sacred
constructs, and burn them,

611
00:48:08.055 --> 00:48:10.290
cut down the images
of their gods,

612
00:48:10.324 --> 00:48:12.359
and erase their
memories of this place.

613
00:48:14.061 --> 00:48:15.229
You know this.

614
00:48:16.997 --> 00:48:18.700
You are so lost.

615
00:48:18.733 --> 00:48:20.968
We must be the ones
to drive the stakes

616
00:48:21.001 --> 00:48:22.403
into their hands and their feet,

617
00:48:22.436 --> 00:48:24.405
for they cannot
do it themselves.

618
00:48:26.006 --> 00:48:28.442
We must cleanse the world
before we can cleanse

619
00:48:28.475 --> 00:48:31.345
- ourselves of it.
- Stop it.

620
00:48:31.378 --> 00:48:32.547
Stop it, please.

621
00:48:35.416 --> 00:48:37.552
I just came here to tell
you that we are leaving.

622
00:48:39.453 --> 00:48:40.522
The other elders and myself,

623
00:48:40.555 --> 00:48:42.590
we have decided that it is time.

624
00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:53.701
When?

625
00:48:53.735 --> 00:48:54.702
Tomorrow morning.

626
00:48:58.506 --> 00:49:01.408
And I know that we asked
for your withdrawal,

627
00:49:01.442 --> 00:49:04.512
and I know that our
beliefs are not the same,

628
00:49:04.546 --> 00:49:06.180
but deep inside you, Remy,

629
00:49:06.213 --> 00:49:08.248
there is a light so bright.

630
00:49:09.584 --> 00:49:12.019
And I know that. And
so does the Lord.

631
00:49:13.153 --> 00:49:15.523
And we just thought
that we owed you

632
00:49:15.557 --> 00:49:17.357
the opportunity to come with us.

633
00:49:23.096 --> 00:49:24.398
You know where to find us.

634
00:49:28.302 --> 00:49:29.436
Say goodbye to your sister.

635
00:49:33.106 --> 00:49:34.742
Hey.

636
00:49:34.776 --> 00:49:35.643
How are you?

637
00:49:35.677 --> 00:49:36.477
Good.

638
00:49:36.511 --> 00:49:37.411
Good.

639
00:49:37.444 --> 00:49:39.213
Theo says we're leaving soon.

640
00:49:41.516 --> 00:49:42.449
Are you coming with us?

641
00:49:45.653 --> 00:49:46.754
I'll think about it.

642
00:49:48.388 --> 00:49:49.456
Come, Jonah. It's time.

643
00:49:51.826 --> 00:49:53.093
It's time. Let's go.

644
00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:44.444
Father.

645
00:50:47.882 --> 00:50:52.386
Father... I am ready for you.

646
00:50:55.355 --> 00:50:56.189
<i>Use me.</i>

647
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.499
<i>Guide my hands to
do your bidding.</i>

648
00:51:12.607 --> 00:51:13.508
<i>I am ready.</i>

649
00:51:24.652 --> 00:51:26.854
How come... your legs are...

650
00:51:26.888 --> 00:51:27.956
I shaved today.

651
00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:32.292
Alright, well, yeah, but
like when it's, like, cold,

652
00:51:32.326 --> 00:51:35.429
like, my hair just grows
back so fucking fast.

653
00:51:36.664 --> 00:51:38.633
Like, yours are all smooth.

654
00:51:38.666 --> 00:51:39.499
Look at mine.

655
00:51:39.534 --> 00:51:40.434
These are nice.

656
00:51:40.467 --> 00:51:41.569
No, I have strawberry legs.

657
00:51:41.603 --> 00:51:43.838
What?! What's a strawberry leg?

658
00:51:43.871 --> 00:51:45.439
I have, like,
black dots on my legs,

659
00:51:45.472 --> 00:51:46.808
so when I shave, and it,

660
00:51:46.841 --> 00:51:48.810
it's just, like, it
always looks hairy.

661
00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.312
It's really unbecoming.

662
00:51:52.346 --> 00:51:53.280
It's really...

663
00:51:54.281 --> 00:51:55.049
Hey.

664
00:51:55.083 --> 00:51:56.684
Only you would notice that.

665
00:51:56.718 --> 00:51:57.552
Hey.

666
00:51:58.553 --> 00:51:59.654
Is everything okay?

667
00:52:00.888 --> 00:52:01.889
Everything's okay.

668
00:52:03.256 --> 00:52:03.858
You want a smoke?

669
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:05.359
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

670
00:52:05.392 --> 00:52:06.293
Okay.

671
00:52:06.326 --> 00:52:07.361
We'll break you down
though, soon enough.

672
00:52:07.394 --> 00:52:10.330
Oh, Sadie-bug, let me
get your cigarette.

673
00:52:17.805 --> 00:52:19.306
Hey, you feel okay?

674
00:52:20.207 --> 00:52:21.509
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

675
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.582
Heads up.

676
00:52:27.615 --> 00:52:28.916
Oh, man. I just sat down.

677
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.785
I'm gonna go get
something to eat.

678
00:52:30.818 --> 00:52:32.486
No, no.

679
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.554
I need to eat.

680
00:52:34.421 --> 00:52:35.188
I need...

681
00:52:35.222 --> 00:52:36.289
Don't do that!

682
00:52:36.323 --> 00:52:37.759
And my fucking feet, too.

683
00:52:41.328 --> 00:52:42.664
Well, who's gonna go?

684
00:52:42.697 --> 00:52:43.531
I'm not going.

685
00:52:46.466 --> 00:52:47.602
Hey, why don't you go down?

686
00:52:47.635 --> 00:52:48.536
Riley, fuck me.

687
00:52:48.569 --> 00:52:50.738
Come on, she's not ready
for the pit, okay?

688
00:52:50.772 --> 00:52:51.673
- Sadie.
- I'll go.

689
00:52:51.706 --> 00:52:52.740
Stop.

690
00:52:52.774 --> 00:52:53.608
Hold on.

691
00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:00.782
Yeah, I can do it.

692
00:53:00.815 --> 00:53:01.683
Yeah?

693
00:53:01.716 --> 00:53:03.618
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

694
00:53:03.651 --> 00:53:04.686
Mm-hm.

695
00:53:05.586 --> 00:53:06.988
What'd I tell you?

696
00:53:07.021 --> 00:53:09.356
- You got a rubber?
- Mm-hm.

697
00:53:09.389 --> 00:53:10.625
Yeah.

698
00:53:10.658 --> 00:53:11.726
You've got this, girl.

699
00:53:11.759 --> 00:53:12.794
Go.

700
00:53:12.827 --> 00:53:13.795
You've got it.

701
00:53:22.537 --> 00:53:23.738
There she goes.

702
00:53:49.797 --> 00:53:51.599
All right, let's
do half and half.

703
00:53:52.934 --> 00:53:54.635
Money's in the cup holder.

704
00:53:55.803 --> 00:53:57.605
You ain't touching
it 'til you're done.

705
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.615
What, you just gonna sit there?

706
00:54:07.648 --> 00:54:09.249
Come on. Mash your motor, honey.

707
00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:18.526
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

708
00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:19.627
What are you doing?

709
00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:20.695
- I was...
- No, no, no, no.

710
00:54:20.728 --> 00:54:22.730
I'm not wearing no raincoat.

711
00:54:22.764 --> 00:54:24.832
There's an extra 40 in there.

712
00:54:24.866 --> 00:54:25.666
All right?

713
00:54:27.101 --> 00:54:29.036
So quit your fucking
lolly-gagging

714
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:31.773
and give me that
bean cap, right now.

715
00:54:32.874 --> 00:54:33.708
Woo, woo!

716
00:54:38.846 --> 00:54:41.314
Hey! Get over here,
you little whore.

717
00:55:27.962 --> 00:55:28.996
Oh. Hey, babe.

718
00:55:31.866 --> 00:55:34.001
So how did, uh, how'd it go?

719
00:55:35.435 --> 00:55:36.804
Good. It went good.

720
00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:42.109
What is that?

721
00:55:46.848 --> 00:55:48.115
Remy, what is that?

722
00:55:54.622 --> 00:55:56.624
Shh...

723
00:55:58.159 --> 00:55:59.426
Just witness.

724
00:56:03.097 --> 00:56:04.799
I'll meet you outside.

725
00:56:04.832 --> 00:56:06.433
Meet me at the car.

726
00:56:20.915 --> 00:56:21.749
Hello?

727
00:56:29.891 --> 00:56:30.691
Are you okay?

728
00:56:49.543 --> 00:56:50.611
Hey, catch.

729
00:56:52.713 --> 00:56:53.648
Thank you.

730
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:54.515
No problem.

731
00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:01.522
How are you?

732
00:57:03.591 --> 00:57:04.525
I'm good.

733
00:57:13.534 --> 00:57:15.836
I heard that some guy
came by the motel for you.

734
00:57:18.139 --> 00:57:18.973
Yeah.

735
00:57:22.176 --> 00:57:25.913
Is that, like, your dad, or
your brother, or something?

736
00:57:27.949 --> 00:57:29.817
You got, like, a
boyfriend or something?

737
00:57:30.818 --> 00:57:31.652
- No.
- No?

738
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:33.854
That's cool.

739
00:57:37.191 --> 00:57:40.661
He likes to think
that he's, like,

740
00:57:40.695 --> 00:57:43.597
my dad, or my older
brother, but he's not.

741
00:57:46.167 --> 00:57:47.668
Yeah, I was just asking.

742
00:57:54.942 --> 00:57:56.010
Looks like you're up.

743
00:58:00.014 --> 00:58:01.248
Hold that.

744
00:58:01.282 --> 00:58:02.817
You can have it.

745
00:58:08.823 --> 00:58:09.991
I'll save it for you.

746
00:58:10.925 --> 00:58:11.759
Okay.

747
00:58:24.138 --> 00:58:25.106
Uh, hi.

748
00:58:25.139 --> 00:58:25.940
Hi.

749
00:58:27.141 --> 00:58:29.844
Uh, to tell you the truth,

750
00:58:29.877 --> 00:58:31.946
I haven't done this before,

751
00:58:31.979 --> 00:58:35.583
and I really don't
know what to say.

752
00:58:36.984 --> 00:58:38.085
Why are you here?

753
00:58:40.654 --> 00:58:43.057
Uh, well, let's see.

754
00:58:45.026 --> 00:58:48.796
Well, I suppose I'm lonely,

755
00:58:50.097 --> 00:58:52.900
just looking to feel
the touch of a woman.

756
00:58:56.804 --> 00:58:58.706
But now you must be cleansed.

757
00:59:02.009 --> 00:59:04.211
Um, is that part of the game?

758
00:59:07.615 --> 00:59:10.251
Salvation is not a game, silly.

759
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.821
Clothe yourself in him.

760
00:59:15.623 --> 00:59:19.126
Make no provisions of the
flesh to fulfill its desires.

761
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:31.038
Um, you know, I think
maybe this was a mistake.

762
00:59:32.339 --> 00:59:34.942
I think I'm gonna
be leaving now.

763
00:59:34.975 --> 00:59:36.710
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

764
00:59:36.744 --> 00:59:37.578
No, no.

765
00:59:40.414 --> 00:59:42.349
Let me do this for you.

766
01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:25.319
Why don't you get
some rest, honey?

767
01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:30.257
I'm right down the hall. Okay?

768
01:01:37.264 --> 01:01:39.099
I'm so sorry, Sadie.

769
01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:52.479
Come here, Rem.

770
01:01:52.514 --> 01:01:53.147
Come here.

771
01:01:55.115 --> 01:01:57.318
Nobody goes out tonight, okay?

772
01:01:57.351 --> 01:01:58.419

Oh shit, yeah.

802
01:04:36.477 --> 01:04:38.278
She could tell a fella, baby.

803
01:05:06.373 --> 01:05:08.242
Why don't you stop
what you're doing,

804
01:05:08.275 --> 01:05:11.245
come in here, and
sit on Santa's lap.

Relax.

809
01:05:33.535 --> 01:05:34.401
You had a hard day, girl.

810
01:05:34.435 --> 01:05:36.003
Mm-hm.

811
01:05:36.036 --> 01:05:37.204
I'm here for you.

812
01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:38.439
Thank you, Santa.

813
01:05:38.472 --> 01:05:39.507
Mm.

814
01:05:42.677 --> 01:05:45.513
Why don't you tell Santa
what you want for Christmas.

815
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:00.994
Come in.

816
01:06:03.063 --> 01:06:03.765
Oh, I'm sorry.

817
01:06:03.798 --> 01:06:05.700
No, it's okay. It's your room.

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:08.035

819
01:06:08.068 --> 01:06:09.036
Yeah, please.

No, just makes
yourself comfortable.

How do you feel?

823
01:06:38.232 --> 01:06:39.399
Just so crazy.

824
01:06:41.468 --> 01:06:44.539
You know, you can be there
one minute and then just gone,

825
01:06:46.708 --> 01:06:47.542
like a light.

826
01:07:02.489 --> 01:07:04.592
That's what I can't get over.

827
01:07:06.561 --> 01:07:08.495
You know, you hear about it
on the news all the time.

828
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.197
It's like, whatever.

829
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.838
But then when it's
somebody you know,

830
01:07:16.871 --> 01:07:18.272
you just can't stop thinking

831
01:07:18.305 --> 01:07:19.541
if there was something
you could have done,

832
01:07:19.574 --> 01:07:23.410
or, like, the last
thing you said to them.

833
01:07:31.586 --> 01:07:32.620
Shoot.

834
01:07:34.154 --> 01:07:34.789
What?

835
01:07:36.524 --> 01:07:38.058
That was the last
thing I said to Liv.

836
01:07:40.662 --> 01:07:42.764

01:07:48.168 --> 01:07:49.336

01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:08.028
Shhhh.

913
01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:08.863
Witness.

914
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.397
My God, I have now
cleansed them for you.

915
01:17:44.865 --> 01:17:47.168
Please accept them into
your kingdom of Heaven.

916
01:17:48.202 --> 01:17:51.205
Guide my hands and
ignite my spirit

917
01:17:52.139 --> 01:17:54.141
as I carry out your will.

918
01:17:56.043 --> 01:17:56.877
Amen.

919
01:19:01.342 --> 01:19:02.142
Riley said you're leaving.

920
01:19:02.176 --> 01:19:03.344
Oh my god, Remy.

921
01:19:05.279 --> 01:19:06.213
God, you scared me.

922
01:19:08.449 --> 01:19:09.850
I'm sorry,

923
01:19:09.883 --> 01:19:12.987
I'm just still a little
jumpy from everything.

924
01:19:14.221 --> 01:19:15.256
It's okay.

925
01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:21.829
Yeah, I uh, I just can't
be here anymore.

926
01:19:23.397 --> 01:19:25.065
I need a change.

927
01:19:25.099 --> 01:19:27.167
I've felt it for a
while, now I know.

928
01:19:30.137 --> 01:19:30.938
Where will you go?

929
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.542
I don't know, and
I don't even care.

930
01:19:34.576 --> 01:19:36.410
Anywhere else, you know?

931
01:19:37.478 --> 01:19:38.279
Yeah.

932
01:19:40.014 --> 01:19:42.816
Look, I'm sorry if it feels
like I'm abandoning you.

933
01:19:44.318 --> 01:19:45.352
It doesn't.

934
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:47.054
I'm leaving too.

935
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:50.324
Oh.

936
01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:53.260
Where are you going?

937
01:19:53.294 --> 01:19:54.328
Home.

938
01:19:58.265 --> 01:20:00.535
I, um, I found
this in my dresser.

939
01:20:00.568 --> 01:20:04.371
I saw the photo of you
and, is that your mother?

940
01:20:06.608 --> 01:20:07.408
Yeah.

941
01:20:08.475 --> 01:20:09.843
What happened to her?

942
01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:15.382
She got sick and left us.

943
01:20:18.252 --> 01:20:19.286
She gave you that?

944
01:20:21.088 --> 01:20:22.456
Yeah, this was hers.

945
01:20:23.658 --> 01:20:24.491
Wanna see it?

946
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:31.465
Why don't you come with me?

947
01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:37.338
I think I need to
do this on my own.

948
01:20:37.371 --> 01:20:38.506
Thank you, though.

949
01:20:40.508 --> 01:20:42.076
Give me a hug.

950
01:20:42.109 --> 01:20:44.378
I'm really glad
I met you, and...

951
01:20:44.411 --> 01:20:45.245
Me too.

952
01:20:48.282 --> 01:20:49.116
Please come.

953
01:20:51.452 --> 01:20:52.286
I can't.

954
01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:55.557
This isn't goodbye, okay?

955
01:20:57.358 --> 01:20:59.193
Riley and Levi are coming too.

956
01:21:02.463 --> 01:21:03.631
They're coming where?

957
01:21:04.998 --> 01:21:06.934
They've already left.

958
01:21:08.402 --> 01:21:11.338
What? What do you mean?

959
01:21:11.372 --> 01:21:14.642
They witnessed, and now
they're waiting for us.

960
01:21:14.676 --> 01:21:15.476
Liv too.

961
01:21:17.512 --> 01:21:19.146
Remy, what are you saying?

962
01:21:21.583 --> 01:21:23.917
I'm saying it's okay.

963
01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:27.221
Sadie.

964
01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:33.394
Riley?

965
01:21:35.663 --> 01:21:39.266
Riley?

966
01:21:40.602 --> 01:21:41.402
Nora?

967
01:21:42.637 --> 01:21:43.671
Nora, come out here.

968
01:21:45.139 --> 01:21:47.007
Everything's gonna
be okay, Sadie.

969
01:21:58.452 --> 01:21:59.920
Levi, come out here!

970
01:22:02.356 --> 01:22:03.190
Levi.

971
01:22:15.335 --> 01:22:16.136
Oh my God!

972
01:22:21.442 --> 01:22:23.010
Don't be scared, Sadie.

973
01:22:25.078 --> 01:22:26.313
They're waiting for us.

974
01:22:27.381 --> 01:22:28.616
They've been cleansed.

975
01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:31.452
It's okay.

976
01:22:31.485 --> 01:22:32.720
Don't come any closer.

977
01:22:32.754 --> 01:22:35.255
I'm not gonna hurt you.

978
01:22:35.289 --> 01:22:36.691
What do you want?

979
01:22:36.724 --> 01:22:38.292
What the fuck do you want?

980
01:22:38.325 --> 01:22:40.762
I want you to come with me.

981
01:22:40.795 --> 01:22:42.764
Riley and Levi, they
are waiting for you.

982
01:22:42.797 --> 01:22:44.465
Listen to me!

983
01:22:44.498 --> 01:22:47.468
I am not going
anywhere with you!

984
01:22:48.536 --> 01:22:49.571
Just leave me alone!

985
01:22:57.478 --> 01:22:58.646
Fucking leave!

986
01:23:02.617 --> 01:23:03.450
Leave!

987
01:23:04.719 --> 01:23:05.520
Leave!

988
01:23:05.553 --> 01:23:06.386
I'm sorry you
won't come with us.

989
01:23:44.592 --> 01:23:45.425
Nora!

990
01:23:59.841 --> 01:24:01.141
Motherfucker.

991
01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:04.846
Sadie?

992
01:24:08.716 --> 01:24:09.551
Riley?

993
01:24:14.488 --> 01:24:15.322
Levi!

994
01:24:17.692 --> 01:24:19.293
You motherfucker.

995
01:25:02.402 --> 01:25:03.236
Oh my god.

996
01:25:13.581 --> 01:25:14.882
Levi, look at you.

997
01:25:18.653 --> 01:25:19.687
Not you.

998
01:25:24.659 --> 01:25:27.729
God, not him, please, not him.

999
01:25:59.226 --> 01:26:00.628
Where am I taking you?

1000
01:26:06.901 --> 01:26:08.703
Just take me home, please.

1001
01:26:34.327 --> 01:26:36.698
Could you maybe
come inside with me?

1002
01:26:48.609 --> 01:26:50.343
Come. Please?

1003
01:27:24.478 --> 01:27:25.747
No! No!

1004
01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:27.749
No, no, no, no!

1005
01:27:27.782 --> 01:27:28.850
No, no!

1006
01:27:28.883 --> 01:27:30.885
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1007
01:27:30.918 --> 01:27:32.687
No!

1008
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.823
No, you were supposed
to wait for me!

1009
01:27:37.024 --> 01:27:39.292
You told me to come back!

1010
01:28:19.801 --> 01:28:20.635
Oh, Jonah!

1011
01:29:33.574 --> 01:29:34.642
They left me.

1012
01:29:37.812 --> 01:29:39.046
They all left me!

1013
01:29:42.650 --> 01:29:44.185
Why'd you do it, Remy?

1014
01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:46.554
It's what God wanted.

1015
01:29:46.587 --> 01:29:48.990
I did what God wanted,

1016
01:29:49.023 --> 01:29:51.158
and they all left me behind!

1017
01:29:53.828 --> 01:29:54.862
They all left me!

1018
01:29:54.896 --> 01:29:56.864
They went without me!

1019
01:29:58.799 --> 01:30:01.135
Drop the fucking blade.

1020
01:30:01.168 --> 01:30:03.070
I have to go.

1021
01:30:03.104 --> 01:30:05.106
I'll fucking shoot
you right here!

1022
01:30:05.139 --> 01:30:06.807
Don't make me do it!

1023
01:30:08.876 --> 01:30:10.778
I'm sorry you
can't come with us.

1024
01:30:10.811 --> 01:30:12.647
