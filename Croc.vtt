00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:26.323
Did you know that you
can get married here?


2
00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.258
In this old place?

3
00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.193
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.821
It looks a bit haunted.

5
00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:30.255
What?

6
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.758
No, it doesn't.

7
00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:35.365
I actually think
it's quite romantic.


8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.168
Romantic?

9
00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.433
Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:39.600
What happened to getting
married in a church?


11
00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:42.438
Churches are for boring people.

12
00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:44.968
Hey, you know I'm not boring.

13
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.938
Hey, stop.

14
00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:49.346
Stop.

15
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.216
Don't think you can
just ply me with wine


16
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.613
and then get what you want.

17
00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:53.779
Why not?

18
00:00:53.814 --> 00:00:55.946
It usually works.

19
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:56.947
Maybe.

20
00:00:56.982 --> 00:00:58.883
But you promised me a massage.

21
00:00:58.918 --> 00:01:01.325
And I will, later.

22
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.294
Later?

23
00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.625
That's what you
always say, and then


24
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.330
you just conveniently forget.

25
00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.992
But I forgot my oil.

26
00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.532
Well, I've got some.

27
00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:11.467
Of course you have.

28
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.208
What was that?

29
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.407
What was what?

30
00:01:17.442 --> 00:01:20.476
I heard something.

31
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.313
It's probably just a fox.

32
00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:26.251
No, it was like a growl.

33
00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:30.519
Do you think it could be, like,
one of them big wild cats?


34
00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:35.491
Babe, there are no big
wild cats around here.


35
00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:36.789
It's probably just a badger.

36
00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:41.827
A badger.

37
00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:42.993
Yes, a badger.

38
00:03:46.052 --> 00:03:46.721
Mike?

39
00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:03.903
Mike, please, you're
scaring me now.


40
00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:04.337
Stop it.

41
00:04:04.372 --> 00:04:09.546
Mike!

42
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.880
Mike?

43
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:32.090
Mike?

44
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.594
Oh, hi, there.

45
00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.925
You must be Dylan.

46
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.860
Yeah, hi.

47
00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:34.158
Welcome to Cedar Manor.

48
00:05:34.193 --> 00:05:35.060
Thank you.

49
00:05:35.095 --> 00:05:35.731
Sorry I'm a bit late.

50
00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:37.128
No problem.

51
00:05:37.163 --> 00:05:39.064
I was starting to think that
the wedding was canceled.


52
00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:40.736
No, I just got held
up at Heathrow.


53
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:41.737
My flight was delayed.

54
00:05:41.772 --> 00:05:43.068
Oh, been anywhere nice?

55
00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:43.904
China.

56
00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:44.674
Oh.

57
00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:45.268
Business or pleasure?

58
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.676
Business.

59
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:47.941
I work for an
anti-poaching organization.


60
00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:48.642
Oh, wow.

61
00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:49.943
Well, let me show you around.

62
00:05:57.788 --> 00:06:00.217
So I take it you haven't
been here before.


63
00:06:00.252 --> 00:06:01.658
No.

64
00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:03.924
So we cater for weddings
of all different sizes.


65
00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:07.191
We have extensive grounds
and buildings available.


66
00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:12.900
So you can see we have
the hot tub, sauna,


67
00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.540
and a pool, and then
this gazebo right here,


68
00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:17.542
where most people get married.

69
00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:18.807
Sounds idea.

70
00:06:18.842 --> 00:06:21.271
Well, tell me more about
this anti-poaching work.


71
00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:23.042
I'm intrigued.

72
00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:24.978
It's mainly educational,
spreading word


73
00:06:25.013 --> 00:06:27.618
about how killing
animals is wrong.


74
00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:29.048
But there's always
some idiots that


75
00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:31.083
think a ground up rhino horn
will give them a hard-on.


76
00:06:31.118 --> 00:06:34.119
That's just silly, isn't it?

77
00:06:34.154 --> 00:06:38.189
So are you ever out there in
Africa in the thick of it?


78
00:06:38.224 --> 00:06:38.926
No.

79
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:39.560
No.

80
00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:40.961
I quit that a while back.

81
00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:42.699
Oh.

82
00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:48.133
My wife, she was
targeted by poachers.


83
00:06:48.168 --> 00:06:53.809
Since the incident, I took a
step back from ranger work.


84
00:06:53.844 --> 00:06:56.141
I'm so sorry to hear that.

85
00:06:56.176 --> 00:06:57.340
These things happen.

86
00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.748
I can't imagine.

87
00:06:58.783 --> 00:07:02.081
How can anyone get over
something like that?


88
00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:03.346
Yeah.

89
00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:24.103
Yeah.

90
00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:28.580
Yeah.

91
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:33.244
Yeah.

92
00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:50.899
Just let it ring.

93
00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:52.802
It's my daughter.

94
00:07:52.837 --> 00:07:54.133
Babe.

95
00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:54.771
I'm coming.

96
00:07:54.806 --> 00:07:56.267
I'm coming.

97
00:07:56.302 --> 00:07:57.268
Yeah, I'm at the venue.

98
00:07:57.303 --> 00:07:59.072
It's great.

99
00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:01.371
They're very accommodating.

100
00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:03.010
You're going to love it.

101
00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:04.275
It's going to be perfect.

102
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.399
Very nice.

103
00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:34.437
It has a certain charm.

104
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.076
A hidden charm.

105
00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.183
Hmm.

106
00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:46.449
Rustic.

107
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.418
A tad bougie.

108
00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:49.826
Quite elegant.

109
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:54.930
Well, I can see what
they're trying to do.


110
00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:57.768
God.

111
00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.671
Mine is the four-poster bed.

112
00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:00.199
What?

113
00:09:00.234 --> 00:09:00.738
No.

114
00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:02.839
That's my room, bitch.

115
00:09:02.874 --> 00:09:03.367
Wait.

116
00:09:05.976 --> 00:09:07.140
Ooh, very nice.

117
00:09:09.914 --> 00:09:11.375
Regal.

118
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.849
Boutique?

119
00:09:12.884 --> 00:09:14.213
Functional.

120
00:09:14.248 --> 00:09:15.281
Oh.

121
00:09:15.316 --> 00:09:17.953
And are you going to be
consummating your marriage


122
00:09:17.988 --> 00:09:19.284
in here in 24 hours time?

123
00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:21.154
I'll consummate your
ass in a minute.


124
00:09:21.189 --> 00:09:24.762
Who are you calling?

125
00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:27.963
I'm trying to get
a hold of my dad.


126
00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:31.362
But there is no
bloody reception.


127
00:09:31.397 --> 00:09:32.495
Running late again?

128
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.134
Yep.

129
00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:36.708
You'd think he'd want to be on
time for his only daughter's


130
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:37.236
wedding.

131
00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:37.808
But...

132
00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:38.842
Oh, chill.

133
00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:41.273
He's probably stuck in traffic.

134
00:09:41.308 --> 00:09:42.010
Yeah.

135
00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:50.722
There you are.

136
00:09:52.957 --> 00:09:53.857
This ain't too shabby.

137
00:09:53.892 --> 00:09:54.759
Hi.

138
00:09:57.192 --> 00:09:59.126
All right, dump your bags.

139
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:00.523
We are having a cuppa.

140
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.129
Just what the doctor ordered.

141
00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:03.526
I could use something stronger.

142
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.868
Oh, it's that bad, was it?

143
00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:07.167
Just the usual dickheads.

144
00:10:07.202 --> 00:10:10.005
Speaking of which, the boys
should be right behind you.


145
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.204
So come on.

146
00:10:16.442 --> 00:10:17.475
Oh, this is nice.

147
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.015
The boss is actually
making us tea for a change.


148
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.787
Oh, less of your cheek.

149
00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:23.821
Where's Lisa?

150
00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.185
She's still trying to get Wi
-Fi.

151
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.055
Well, this place is pretty cool.

152
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.859
Amy, did you say you've
been here before?


153
00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.091
Yeah, I told Lisa
about this place,


154
00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:31.862
because I'd been here
before with my ex.


155
00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:32.830
Nice.

156
00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:34.062
Did you have a good time?

157
00:10:34.097 --> 00:10:36.229
Can't have been that
good if he's your ex.


158
00:10:36.264 --> 00:10:38.429
Well, we certainly made
use of the hot tub.


159
00:10:38.464 --> 00:10:39.034
Yes, Amy.

160
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.066
Oh, naughty girl.

161
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:42.367
It hasn't been cleaned since.

162
00:10:42.402 --> 00:10:43.302
I'm not going in it.

163
00:10:46.241 --> 00:10:48.571
Did anyone hear the
story about this place?


164
00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:49.440
Oh, yeah.

165
00:10:49.475 --> 00:10:49.913
No.

166
00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:50.573
No.

167
00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.179
What story?

168
00:10:52.214 --> 00:10:59.824
Well, about a year or so
ago, two locals went missing.


169
00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:03.520
The police found the remains
of a party and a torn-up tent


170
00:11:03.555 --> 00:11:07.557
down at the end of the
grounds, but no bodies.


171
00:11:07.592 --> 00:11:08.393
What?

172
00:11:08.428 --> 00:11:09.594
No way.

173
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:11.198
If you're You telling me that,
I'll never get any sleep.


174
00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:12.331
Oh, babe, you're
sharing a room with me.


175
00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:13.805
You're not getting
any sleep anyway.


176
00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:16.203
Kinky.

177
00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:18.568
Oh, my god, and they
never found them?


178
00:11:18.603 --> 00:11:19.877
No.

179
00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.274
And they don't
know what happened.


180
00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:23.111
So the bodies could still
be in the ground somewhere.


181
00:11:23.146 --> 00:11:24.607
Shit, or in the cellar.

182
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.346
Oh, please don't tell me
this place has a cellar.


183
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:28.281
There might be.

184
00:11:28.316 --> 00:11:29.414
Oh, great choice of location.

185
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:31.218
There's dead bodies
in the cellar.


186
00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:31.752
Shh.

187
00:11:31.787 --> 00:11:34.023
Dead bodies, where?

188
00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:36.619
Oh, we were just
discussing a horror film.


189
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.962
How'd you get on with the Wi
-Fi?

190
00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:41.866
It's still not connecting.

191
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:43.527
I mean, I unplugged the router.

192
00:11:43.562 --> 00:11:47.872
I reset the whole thing,
and nothing is working.


193
00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.038
Why do you need Wi
-Fi?

194
00:11:49.073 --> 00:11:50.402
You've got us to entertain you.

195
00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:53.141
It's not that.

196
00:11:53.176 --> 00:11:54.637
It's just I wanted to
live stream the wedding.


197
00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:58.608
And I would use my phone,
but the reception is crap.


198
00:11:58.643 --> 00:12:01.952
And I was promised
that there would be Wi-Fi,


199
00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:03.547
but nothing seems to be working.

200
00:12:03.582 --> 00:12:06.121
And there are people who
aren't going to be here,


201
00:12:06.156 --> 00:12:07.518
like my grandparents.

202
00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:10.653
And I just... they're all
expecting a live stream from me.


203
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:11.555
And...

204
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.128
Hey, it'll be all right.

205
00:12:13.163 --> 00:12:14.459
We'll get it fixed.

206
00:12:14.494 --> 00:12:17.396
And if not, it's still
being videoed, isn't it?


207
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:20.135
The most important thing
is that you and Charlie


208
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.664
are getting married tomorrow.

209
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.875
That is definitely
going to happen.


210
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.338
It's your day.

211
00:12:25.373 --> 00:12:28.407
It's all about you
and Charlie boy...


212
00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:29.012
But mostly you.

213
00:12:30.213 --> 00:12:32.411
Oh, speak of the devil.

214
00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:33.148
Ladies.

215
00:12:34.184 --> 00:12:35.953
Hello, wifey.

216
00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:37.581
Not quite yet.

217
00:12:37.616 --> 00:12:39.550
Is everything all right?

218
00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:40.958
Wi
-Fi is down.

219
00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:42.421
Oh, shit.

220
00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:44.555
OK, well, Ben could take
a look at it, right?


221
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.193
Yeah.

222
00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:46.161
Probably, yeah.

223
00:12:46.196 --> 00:12:47.294
All right.

224
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:48.493
So shall we get
this party started?


225
00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:50.099
Yes.

226
00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:52.695
Line them up.

227
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.267
Oh, careful.

228
00:12:56.302 --> 00:12:58.338
Oh, don't worry, it won't stain.

229
00:12:58.373 --> 00:13:01.176
She's more worried
about you wasting it.


230
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:02.408
Don't worry.

231
00:13:02.443 --> 00:13:04.113
There's plenty more
where this came from.


232
00:13:04.148 --> 00:13:04.707
Wifey?

233
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:05.708
Well, no.

234
00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:07.248
No, I am not really drinking.

235
00:13:07.283 --> 00:13:09.184
And nor should you be.

236
00:13:09.219 --> 00:13:11.252
I don't want you looking
all hungover tomorrow.


237
00:13:11.287 --> 00:13:13.650
Oh, what are you trying to say?

238
00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:16.653
Ben, you are in charge of
making sure he doesn't overdo it


239
00:13:16.688 --> 00:13:17.621
tonight, please.

240
00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:18.490
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:21.625
Are you drinking this then?

242
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.461
Absolutely.

243
00:13:22.496 --> 00:13:23.198
OK, fill her up.

244
00:13:23.233 --> 00:13:24.595
All right, come on.

245
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.662
Don't be shy.

246
00:13:25.697 --> 00:13:26.498
I'm not being shy.

247
00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:27.037
More?

248
00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:27.532
More.

249
00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:28.071
Yeah?

250
00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:28.599
More.

251
00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:29.138
More?

252
00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:32.207
Chin, chin, Benjamin.

253
00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:33.472
Cheers, mate.

254
00:13:33.507 --> 00:13:37.377
Ladies and this muppet,
I'd like to thank you


255
00:13:37.412 --> 00:13:43.218
all for coming to watch me
marry this absolute beauty.


256
00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:45.990
Here's to an
unforgettable wedding.


257
00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:46.518
Whoo!

258
00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:47.057
Cheers.

259
00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:47.552
Cheers!

260
00:13:47.587 --> 00:13:48.091
Cheers!

261
00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:48.421
Cheers!

262
00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:53.558
Yes, with the palm trees.

263
00:13:53.593 --> 00:13:56.066
With the cocktails, those
really good cocktails.


264
00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.067
What was that guy's name?

265
00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:57.727
The...

266
00:13:57.762 --> 00:13:59.069
Umbrellas and...

267
00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:00.004
It was like or something.

268
00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:00.631
That's my dad.

269
00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:01.698
Be right back.

270
00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:02.402
OK.

271
00:14:13.217 --> 00:14:15.250
And what time do you call this?

272
00:14:15.285 --> 00:14:16.317
I'm sorry, babe.

273
00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:20.321
You know how it is...

274
00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:23.588
Work commitments.

275
00:14:23.623 --> 00:14:24.996
So where's my room?

276
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.294
Come on, this way.

277
00:14:32.302 --> 00:14:35.303
I'm afraid you're stuck
with a single room,


278
00:14:35.338 --> 00:14:40.209
although I'm not sure you're
going to fit in this bed.


279
00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:41.210
Don't worry.

280
00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:43.179
Reminds me of the ranger ways...

281
00:14:43.214 --> 00:14:44.642
Teeny, tiny camp beds.

282
00:14:54.489 --> 00:14:56.819
I can't believe my little
girl is getting married.


283
00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.755
I'm not a little girl anymore.

284
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.594
I am all grown up, with
a job and everything.


285
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:03.826
You call it a job.

286
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:06.367
But we both know,
fashion isn't a real job.


287
00:15:06.402 --> 00:15:09.601
Fashion isn't a real job.

288
00:15:09.636 --> 00:15:12.769
Don't let Vanessa hear you say
that. she'd probably slap you.


289
00:15:12.804 --> 00:15:15.838
To be honest, I think
you'd come off second best.


290
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:16.641
Sounds hot.

291
00:15:16.676 --> 00:15:19.446
Oh, Dad.

292
00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:22.350
No, I think you two would
actually get on really well.


293
00:15:22.385 --> 00:15:24.121
I don't know.

294
00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:26.849
Maybe it's time to...

295
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.620
Lisa.

296
00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:30.490
Dad, come on.

297
00:15:30.525 --> 00:15:34.461
It's been a long time since...

298
00:15:34.496 --> 00:15:36.793
I just want to see
you happy again.


299
00:15:36.828 --> 00:15:37.860
I know.

300
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.334
I know, yes.

301
00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:40.863
That reminds me.

302
00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:41.964
I've got something for you.

303
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:50.213
I believe the traditional
rhyme goes, something old.


304
00:15:50.248 --> 00:15:53.084
I got this for your Mum
when we were in Africa.


305
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.452
And I want you to have it.

306
00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:02.786
Thank you.

307
00:16:02.821 --> 00:16:05.162
Now, don't get emotional.

308
00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:07.362
You go join the party.

309
00:16:07.397 --> 00:16:10.563
I'll be down in a second.

310
00:16:25.811 --> 00:16:30.220
Oh, you surprised me.

311
00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.321
Hi, I'm Vanessa.

312
00:16:32.356 --> 00:16:33.718
Dylan.

313
00:16:33.753 --> 00:16:34.352
We...

314
00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:37.161
We met before, didn't we?

315
00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.295
Yeah, the...

316
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.200
The Christmas party
at the sky garden.


317
00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:47.567
Ah, yes, a little
glitzy for my taste.


318
00:16:47.602 --> 00:16:52.242
Yes, I remember you saying that
you didn't really do fashion.


319
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.475
Hmm.

320
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.842
Well, you certainly know
how to pick out a shirt.


321
00:16:58.877 --> 00:17:00.811
That's saying something.

322
00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:04.254
Well, it is just a
shirt and trousers.


323
00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:07.224
I can't really get that wrong.

324
00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.588
You'd be surprised.

325
00:17:11.395 --> 00:17:13.428
Can I get you a drink?

326
00:17:13.463 --> 00:17:16.596
Absolutely.

327
00:17:16.631 --> 00:17:19.566
I see you two are
getting reacquainted.


328
00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:23.504
Vanessa's just giving
me some fashion tips.


329
00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:26.705
Oh, well, I've been trying
to do that for years.


330
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.708
But it sounds like you're having
a lot more success than I ever


331
00:17:29.743 --> 00:17:31.875
did, so I'll leave
you guys to it.


332
00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:52.896
What do you think you're doing?

333
00:17:52.931 --> 00:17:53.600
Now kiss!

334
00:17:53.635 --> 00:17:53.963
Kiss!

335
00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:07.812
I am going to go to bed.

336
00:18:07.847 --> 00:18:11.552
Oh, OK, honey.

337
00:18:11.587 --> 00:18:14.258
Don't stay up too late.

338
00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:17.019
I thought we were going to
wait until we were married


339
00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:18.625
for you to start nagging me.

340
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.891
Yeah, well, I am
just practicing.


341
00:18:22.895 --> 00:18:24.367
Good night, everyone.

342
00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:24.895
Night.

343
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:25.395
Night.

344
00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:32.408
Hey, how's it going?

345
00:18:32.443 --> 00:18:36.940
How about me and you go
walk around the grounds.


346
00:18:36.975 --> 00:18:42.814
Oh, I'm pretty quiet tired,
so better catch some Zs.


347
00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:43.353
Really?

348
00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:44.585
Yeah.

349
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.982
Oh, maybe tomorrow then.

350
00:18:50.725 --> 00:18:52.296
Don't worry about it, mate.

351
00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:53.693
She'll be up for it tomorrow.

352
00:18:53.728 --> 00:18:56.333
Bridesmaids are always
gagging for it on the day, OK?


353
00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:56.927
Yeah.

354
00:18:56.962 --> 00:18:57.664
So chin up.

355
00:18:57.699 --> 00:18:58.533
Go get some rest.

356
00:18:58.568 --> 00:18:59.402
I'll clean up here, OK?

357
00:18:59.437 --> 00:18:59.963
All right.

358
00:19:06.906 --> 00:19:07.872
Hi, there.

359
00:19:07.907 --> 00:19:10.578
Hi.

360
00:19:10.613 --> 00:19:14.384
So you've been making
eyes at me all night.


361
00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.980
Thought there was
something on my face.


362
00:19:17.015 --> 00:19:19.422
Could be if you want it to.

363
00:19:19.457 --> 00:19:21.985
Oh, yeah?

364
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.788
Such as?

365
00:19:26.662 --> 00:19:31.093
See, I think it's just
better if I show you.


366
00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:37.836
My heart is saying, no.

367
00:19:37.871 --> 00:19:40.707
But you're dick's saying, yes.

368
00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:43.072
Your dick always says, yes.

369
00:19:43.107 --> 00:19:44.975
Come on.

370
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.582
She's not married yet.

371
00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:49.881
True.

372
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.452
Who knows?

373
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.120
We'll before then.

374
00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.297
Come on.

375
00:20:02.027 --> 00:20:03.598
I'm coming.

376
00:20:03.633 --> 00:20:05.127
Tell you what,
Georgie, you'd better


377
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:06.502
be leading me out to my death.

378
00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:07.932
My god, don't be so ridiculous.

379
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.380
What is this place?

380
00:20:19.682 --> 00:20:21.649
Georgie, it's a...

381
00:20:21.684 --> 00:20:23.618
Don't complain.

382
00:20:23.653 --> 00:20:25.147
It's a nice place.

383
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.457
Jesus Christ.

384
00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:28.656
This all right?

385
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:37.401
We shouldn't be doing this.

386
00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:37.929
It's OK.

387
00:20:37.964 --> 00:20:38.567
Come on.

388
00:20:38.602 --> 00:20:39.161
You wanted this.

389
00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:39.964
The torch.

390
00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:41.064
Fuck the torch.

391
00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:46.036
Yeah, come on.

392
00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:47.906
I'm coming.

393
00:20:47.941 --> 00:20:48.610
Yeah.

394
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.522
Bet Lisa doesn't fuck
you like this, eh?


395
00:20:59.557 --> 00:21:02.591
I love it when you go hard.

396
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.066
It's all right,
probably just a fox.


397
00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:21.709
What's that?

398
00:21:42.897 --> 00:21:43.797
Georgie.

399
00:21:43.832 --> 00:21:44.534
Georgie!

400
00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:45.161
Georgie, the window!

401
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:48.032
The sill, it's stuck.

402
00:21:48.067 --> 00:21:50.001
Come on!

403
00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:51.002
Come on!

404
00:22:06.151 --> 00:22:07.018
Oh, Georgie.

405
00:22:10.628 --> 00:22:11.220
Fuck!

406
00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:13.255
Georgie.

407
00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:14.316
All set for the big day?

408
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:14.987
Yeah.

409
00:23:15.022 --> 00:23:16.956
You?

410
00:23:16.991 --> 00:23:17.528
Yeah.

411
00:23:24.834 --> 00:23:27.032
Don't fuck this up.

412
00:23:46.856 --> 00:23:48.559
Where'd you go, mate?

413
00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:52.794
Uh, just for a wander.

414
00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:01.737
You didn't see Georgie,
did you, on your travels?


415
00:24:01.772 --> 00:24:04.036
She wasn't in her room.

416
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:05.906
No.

417
00:24:05.941 --> 00:24:08.172
Bet she's playing hard to get.

418
00:24:08.207 --> 00:24:10.581
Ben?

419
00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:11.142
Yeah?

420
00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:16.114
Nothing.

421
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.785
Good night.

422
00:24:23.156 --> 00:24:25.728
Morning, bridey.

423
00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:27.664
Morning.

424
00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.326
You're getting married today.

425
00:24:30.361 --> 00:24:31.932
Stop.

426
00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:34.198
It's not normal to have this
much energy in the morning.


427
00:24:34.233 --> 00:24:36.673
Plant-based diet,
I keep telling you.


428
00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:37.201
No.

429
00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:38.002
No way.

430
00:24:38.037 --> 00:24:40.875
I'm not giving up
my meat, bacon.


431
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.143
Speaking of, can I bring
you some breakfast?


432
00:24:45.178 --> 00:24:45.844
Oh, no.

433
00:24:45.879 --> 00:24:47.717
No, I don't want to be bloated.

434
00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:49.312
OK, but at least eat something.

435
00:24:49.347 --> 00:24:50.951
Nobody wants a dead bride.

436
00:24:53.758 --> 00:24:54.724
Piece of bacon?

437
00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:55.285
Oh, please.

438
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.628
Amazing.

439
00:24:57.663 --> 00:24:59.058
We seem to be missing the bride.

440
00:24:59.093 --> 00:25:01.159
Oh, she's just staying in her
room until the big moment.


441
00:25:01.194 --> 00:25:02.699
We don't want to see the groom.

442
00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:03.898
It's bad luck.

443
00:25:03.933 --> 00:25:05.163
What about the groom?

444
00:25:05.198 --> 00:25:06.934
Oh, he's still in bed
pending bacon Sammy.


445
00:25:06.969 --> 00:25:08.067
Has anyone seen Georgie?

446
00:25:08.102 --> 00:25:09.431
Probably still
trying to avoid Ben.


447
00:25:10.434 --> 00:25:11.301
What?

448
00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:12.168
Nothing.

449
00:25:12.204 --> 00:25:13.743
She's staying in
your room, isn't she?


450
00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:14.909
Well, I thought
so, but she wasn't


451
00:25:14.944 --> 00:25:16.207
there before I went to sleep.

452
00:25:16.242 --> 00:25:17.141
Oh, weird.

453
00:25:17.177 --> 00:25:18.374
Oh, my god, do you
think she's with Dylan?


454
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:19.914
No.

455
00:25:19.949 --> 00:25:21.245
I didn't think he was her type.

456
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.048
Is he?

457
00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:23.445
Well, that settles it.

458
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.721
Settles what?

459
00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.448
Oh, well, maybe
she was with Amy.


460
00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:27.757
Who?

461
00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:29.055
Was Georgie staying
in your room?


462
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.589
No.

463
00:25:29.624 --> 00:25:32.696
Must be Dylan then.

464
00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:33.961
Dylan?

465
00:25:33.996 --> 00:25:35.765
You're doing Lisa's hair
and makeup, aren't you?


466
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.931
Yeah.

467
00:25:36.966 --> 00:25:38.097
When you go up,
take that with you.


468
00:25:38.132 --> 00:25:39.230
Try to get her to
eat at least some.


469
00:25:39.265 --> 00:25:41.199
Yeah, sure thing.

470
00:25:41.234 --> 00:25:43.938
All right, ladies, I'm going
to take this to the groom.


471
00:25:43.973 --> 00:25:45.104
See you at the wedding.

472
00:25:45.139 --> 00:25:45.676
Bye.

473
00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:48.778
All right.

474
00:25:48.813 --> 00:25:49.878
I ain't got a napkin.

475
00:25:52.476 --> 00:25:53.145
Brekkies.

476
00:25:55.886 --> 00:25:56.379
Cheers.

477
00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:03.958
You all right, mate?

478
00:26:03.993 --> 00:26:05.190
Are you a bit nervous?

479
00:26:10.164 --> 00:26:17.235
What I'm about to tell you
does not leave this room.


480
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.102
All right.

481
00:26:18.138 --> 00:26:19.336
Yeah, that's what
best men are for.


482
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.374
Last night...

483
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:25.309
Yeah?

484
00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:27.278
...I was with Georgie.

485
00:26:27.313 --> 00:26:29.720
Oh.

486
00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.018
I'm sorry, mate.

487
00:26:31.053 --> 00:26:32.283
We go way back.

488
00:26:32.318 --> 00:26:38.058
And we've always been
fond of each other.


489
00:26:38.093 --> 00:26:40.731
Hey, it's not the
end of the world.


490
00:26:43.428 --> 00:26:45.802
And you get on to me now.

491
00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:46.330
So...

492
00:26:49.434 --> 00:26:52.402
No, that's not it.

493
00:26:52.437 --> 00:26:53.303
No?

494
00:26:53.338 --> 00:26:58.276
While we were at it,
we were attacked.


495
00:26:58.311 --> 00:27:00.278
Attacked?

496
00:27:00.313 --> 00:27:01.983
This is going to sound insane...

497
00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:09.419
By a giant crocodile.

498
00:27:09.454 --> 00:27:11.861
A crocodile?

499
00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:14.424
It got Georgie.

500
00:27:14.459 --> 00:27:15.194
Wait.

501
00:27:15.229 --> 00:27:17.196
This is a prank, right?

502
00:27:17.231 --> 00:27:17.966
No.

503
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.200
No, I'm dead serious.

504
00:27:21.235 --> 00:27:29.235
It came out of nowhere,
just bit her in half.


505
00:27:29.947 --> 00:27:31.474
What's a crocodile
doing around here?


506
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.079
I don't know.

507
00:27:36.114 --> 00:27:37.480
Ben, that doesn't matter.

508
00:27:40.221 --> 00:27:43.123
The thing is I can't tell
anyone, because then they will


509
00:27:43.158 --> 00:27:44.520
know that I was with Georgie.

510
00:27:44.555 --> 00:27:52.555
And the wedding... just keep
an eye out for it in case


511
00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:56.400
it, like, shows up.

512
00:27:56.435 --> 00:27:57.104
All right.

513
00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:11.580
Oh, you look lovely.

514
00:28:11.615 --> 00:28:12.350
Hi.

515
00:28:12.385 --> 00:28:14.286
Are you OK?

516
00:28:14.321 --> 00:28:15.584
Charlie.

517
00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:16.992
Charlie!

518
00:28:17.027 --> 00:28:17.993
Dad.

519
00:28:18.028 --> 00:28:18.521
Hi.

520
00:28:18.556 --> 00:28:19.522
Hi, Mom.

521
00:28:19.557 --> 00:28:20.292
Hello, darling.

522
00:28:20.327 --> 00:28:21.832
How are you?

523
00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:24.593
Yeah, I'm OK, yeah.

524
00:28:24.628 --> 00:28:25.968
You seem a bit anxious.

525
00:28:26.003 --> 00:28:27.134
Why so nervous?

526
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:28.399
This is the easy bit.

527
00:28:28.434 --> 00:28:31.369
It's the next 50 years
that's the hard bit.


528
00:28:31.404 --> 00:28:35.142
Just keep your eyes peeled, OK?

529
00:28:53.558 --> 00:28:56.460
My beautiful daughter.

530
00:28:56.495 --> 00:28:56.999
Hi.

531
00:28:57.034 --> 00:28:59.661
Sorry.

532
00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:01.564
You look stunning, darling.

533
00:29:01.599 --> 00:29:03.302
Thank you.

534
00:29:03.337 --> 00:29:05.238
You don't know where
Georgie is, do you?


535
00:29:05.273 --> 00:29:06.305
No.

536
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.538
It's just that we
kind of thought...


537
00:29:08.573 --> 00:29:10.144
Never mind.

538
00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:11.915
No one's seen her this morning.

539
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.312
We have no idea where she is.

540
00:29:13.347 --> 00:29:15.347
Where could she have gone?

541
00:29:15.382 --> 00:29:17.448
She had a few drinks
last night, yeah?


542
00:29:17.483 --> 00:29:19.351
Yeah.

543
00:29:19.386 --> 00:29:21.320
She hasn't got a
reason to vanish...


544
00:29:21.355 --> 00:29:25.324
I mean, her depression, anxiety?

545
00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:27.095
No.

546
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.899
Can she swim?

547
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.461
I think so.

548
00:29:30.496 --> 00:29:32.694
OK, I'm going to
scout the grounds.


549
00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:34.003
You stay here.

550
00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:34.531
OK.

551
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.180
I hate to say this, but I've got
another appointment after this.


552
00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:05.742
Oh, OK.

553
00:33:05.777 --> 00:33:06.545
All right, yeah.

554
00:33:12.751 --> 00:33:14.157
Must be so proud.

555
00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.389
Hmm.

556
00:33:15.424 --> 00:33:18.656
We can't find Georgie.

557
00:33:18.691 --> 00:33:19.223
OK.

558
00:33:19.258 --> 00:33:21.329
Can we go without her?

559
00:33:21.364 --> 00:33:22.825
Without?

560
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.925
Dylan's looking for her now.

561
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.102
Give us a few minutes.

562
00:33:28.866 --> 00:33:30.173
No word?

563
00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.669
No.

564
00:33:31.704 --> 00:33:33.671
The reverend is
getting impatient.


565
00:33:33.706 --> 00:33:37.180
We may have to go ahead anyway.

566
00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.412
One must go.

567
00:33:38.447 --> 00:33:39.248
Fingers crossed.

568
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:46.882
Fuck.

569
00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:50.952
Oh, shit.

570
00:34:01.899 --> 00:34:03.437
Shit.

571
00:34:03.472 --> 00:34:04.768
If he doesn't turn
up in two minutes,


572
00:34:04.803 --> 00:34:07.276
we'll have to go
ahead without him.


573
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:08.640
No.

574
00:34:08.675 --> 00:34:11.280
No, there's no way I'm getting
married without my dad.


575
00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:12.611
You might have to, babe.

576
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:18.452
Who's going of walk
me down the aisle?


577
00:34:18.487 --> 00:34:19.783
Well, I can't, can I?

578
00:34:19.818 --> 00:34:20.817
That would be weird.

579
00:34:23.822 --> 00:34:24.855
I guess I could.

580
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:27.494
I've almost been like a
surrogate parent, anyway.


581
00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:31.333
I'd like that.

582
00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:12.033
Where's her dad?

583
00:35:12.068 --> 00:35:13.243
We can't find him.

584
00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:13.837
What?

585
00:35:13.872 --> 00:35:14.805
It's fine.

586
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.815
Hey, you come with a package.

587
00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:46.342
Ladies and gentlemen... in these
days, I'm obligated to say,


588
00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:49.873
and those who
identify as neither...


589
00:35:49.908 --> 00:35:52.007
It's lovely to see
you all here today.


590
00:35:52.042 --> 00:35:54.350
And I'm so glad that you
could make the journey


591
00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:55.582
in these difficult times.

592
00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:58.948
Dearly beloved...

593
00:36:00.051 --> 00:36:03.392
...We are gathered here
today in the presence of...


594
00:36:06.595 --> 00:36:08.859
All mighty god!

595
00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:33.983
Get up.

596
00:36:34.018 --> 00:36:34.417
Get up.

597
00:36:34.452 --> 00:36:35.523
Come on, get up.

598
00:36:35.558 --> 00:36:36.051
Get up.

599
00:36:36.086 --> 00:36:36.854
Get up.

600
00:36:36.889 --> 00:36:37.492
Hey, come on.

601
00:36:37.527 --> 00:36:38.086
Come on. get up.

602
00:36:38.121 --> 00:36:39.087
Get up.

603
00:36:39.122 --> 00:36:40.088
Sarah, there's two of them.

604
00:36:40.123 --> 00:36:41.793
Sarah, there's two of them.

605
00:36:46.129 --> 00:36:46.864
Wait.

606
00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:47.898
Stop.

607
00:36:47.933 --> 00:36:48.437
Stop.

608
00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:48.932
Stop.

609
00:36:48.967 --> 00:36:49.438
Go.

610
00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:49.933
Go.

611
00:36:49.968 --> 00:36:50.439
Go.

612
00:36:50.474 --> 00:36:50.934
Go.

613
00:36:50.969 --> 00:36:51.440
Go.

614
00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:52.001
Go.

615
00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:04.387
Tara.

616
00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:05.421
Oh, my god.

617
00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:06.554
Tara, we got to go.

618
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:10.987
Fuck.

619
00:37:16.533 --> 00:37:17.499
Running for my car.

620
00:37:17.534 --> 00:37:19.468
My car's around the corner.

621
00:37:29.843 --> 00:37:31.447
Wait.

622
00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:31.975
In here.

623
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:32.679
In here.

624
00:37:41.151 --> 00:37:43.085
What the fuck just happened?

625
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.086
I don't know.

626
00:37:47.696 --> 00:37:48.629
Get it open.

627
00:37:54.197 --> 00:37:55.735
Fuck.

628
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.101
Oh, guys, I'm going
to need first aid.


629
00:37:59.136 --> 00:38:01.004
What is happening?

630
00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:02.005
Why is this happening?

631
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.073
Why is this happening
to me on my wedding day?


632
00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:07.208
First, my bridesmaid
goes missing.


633
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:09.485
And Then my dad goes missing.

634
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.013
And then...

635
00:38:17.594 --> 00:38:18.857
Do you think it got them?

636
00:38:18.892 --> 00:38:22.432
Do you think it's
eaten them as well?


637
00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:23.466
What if it bites us?

638
00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.160
What if it gets in here?

639
00:38:25.195 --> 00:38:26.095
Don't worry.

640
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.031
It can't get in here.

641
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:35.610
Let me in!

642
00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.209
It's the reverend.

643
00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:46.115
Thank you.

644
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.249
Thank you.

645
00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:49.459
Are you all right?

646
00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:51.494
Yes, I'm alive, thank god.

647
00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:53.562
But others weren't so lucky.

648
00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.728
Is it just you?

649
00:38:54.763 --> 00:38:55.795
Did you see anyone else?

650
00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:58.028
Have you seen Amy or V, my dad?

651
00:38:58.063 --> 00:38:58.895
I don't know.

652
00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:00.668
Everyone went in
different directions.


653
00:39:00.703 --> 00:39:02.736
So what do we do?

654
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:06.509
Well, call emergency
services, and then


655
00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:08.907
hope that thing doesn't get
anyone else in the meantime.


656
00:39:08.942 --> 00:39:10.678
It's going to be
easier said than done.


657
00:39:10.713 --> 00:39:11.580
There's no bars.

658
00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.911
Is there a land line?

659
00:39:12.946 --> 00:39:13.648
No.

660
00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:15.749
Great.

661
00:39:15.784 --> 00:39:19.016
Then we're fucked.

662
00:39:19.051 --> 00:39:20.754
Sorry.

663
00:39:20.789 --> 00:39:22.052
Don't worry.

664
00:39:22.087 --> 00:39:25.693
I think I may have just
said similar words myself.


665
00:39:25.728 --> 00:39:27.596
What now then?

666
00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:29.092
Let's pray.

667
00:39:29.127 --> 00:39:33.162
Dear heavenly father, we pray
for your help in these trying


668
00:39:33.197 --> 00:39:34.230
times.

669
00:39:34.265 --> 00:39:38.167
We pray for you to look
after us and to protect us


670
00:39:38.202 --> 00:39:39.135
against the beast.

671
00:39:48.817 --> 00:39:49.915
Where's Neil?

672
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.918
I've got to find Neil.

673
00:39:52.953 --> 00:39:54.117
No.

674
00:39:54.152 --> 00:39:56.251
He went the other way.

675
00:39:56.286 --> 00:39:58.693
The car keys.

676
00:39:58.728 --> 00:39:59.595
No.

677
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.058
Neil's got the keys.

678
00:40:01.093 --> 00:40:03.093
Maybe we can make it to the car.

679
00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:23.278
It's there.

680
00:40:23.313 --> 00:40:24.752
Shh.

681
00:40:24.787 --> 00:40:26.985
Don't make a sound.

682
00:40:29.286 --> 00:40:30.252
Where's Lisa?

683
00:40:30.287 --> 00:40:31.319
We have to find Lisa.

684
00:40:31.354 --> 00:40:32.221
Don't worry.

685
00:40:32.256 --> 00:40:33.422
I'm sure she's fine.

686
00:40:33.457 --> 00:40:35.224
The most important thing is
we get safe and we get help.


687
00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:36.093
OK.

688
00:40:36.128 --> 00:40:37.094
Let's try and get to my car.

689
00:40:37.129 --> 00:40:38.128
I've got keys.

690
00:40:55.048 --> 00:40:55.552
No!

691
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.151
Tabby?

692
00:41:01.186 --> 00:41:02.086
I'll start it up.

693
00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:22.205
OK, pull yourself together.

694
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.308
When in times of stress, always
go back to your breathing.


695
00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:35.152
Fuck.

696
00:41:35.187 --> 00:41:36.087
Oh, come on.

697
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.096
Tabby?

698
00:41:51.401 --> 00:41:52.070
God.

699
00:41:54.877 --> 00:41:56.338
It's all right.

700
00:41:56.373 --> 00:41:58.307
You're going to be OK.

701
00:41:58.342 --> 00:42:00.309
Let's get you to the car.

702
00:42:13.962 --> 00:42:15.060
Maybe we should go back.

703
00:42:15.095 --> 00:42:16.061
They might be
wondering where we are.


704
00:42:16.096 --> 00:42:17.293
Or if we're still alive.

705
00:42:19.968 --> 00:42:22.199
Maybe we should just
wait here and see


706
00:42:22.234 --> 00:42:25.675
if someone comes and finds us.

707
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:34.211
Sarah, don't move.

708
00:42:41.451 --> 00:42:43.891
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

709
00:42:43.926 --> 00:42:45.354
Oh, my god, what do we do?

710
00:42:45.389 --> 00:42:46.355
Find a way out.

711
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.394
It's locked.

712
00:42:52.429 --> 00:42:53.901
We need to get out of here.

713
00:43:09.215 --> 00:43:10.181
Help!

714
00:43:10.216 --> 00:43:12.150
Sarah, help!

715
00:43:12.185 --> 00:43:12.722
Sarah!

716
00:43:34.471 --> 00:43:36.845
Christ, you scared
the shit out of me.


717
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.846
Sorry.

718
00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:40.882
You couldn't be heard screaming.

719
00:43:40.917 --> 00:43:42.345
What the hell is that?

720
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.346
And where is it?

721
00:43:43.381 --> 00:43:46.481
It's a crocodile, but I
don't know what species.


722
00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:48.483
I thought you were an expert.

723
00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:50.023
Not exactly.

724
00:43:50.058 --> 00:43:53.026
But I do know it shouldn't
be living in this climate.


725
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:55.765
And it's also very dangerous.

726
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.492
Tell me something I don't know.

727
00:43:57.527 --> 00:43:58.999
You got a twig in your hair.

728
00:44:02.466 --> 00:44:03.168
Good.

729
00:44:03.203 --> 00:44:04.070
Let me untangle it.

730
00:44:13.345 --> 00:44:16.412
Is that your distressed look?

731
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.121
You didn't answer my question.

732
00:44:22.156 --> 00:44:27.192
Yes, it's out there.

733
00:44:27.227 --> 00:44:30.899
And how are we going to kill it?

734
00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:33.528
I don't intend to kill it.

735
00:44:33.563 --> 00:44:35.002
I intend to catch it.

736
00:44:39.272 --> 00:44:42.471
All right, we need a plan.

737
00:44:42.506 --> 00:44:44.979
Agreed.

738
00:44:45.014 --> 00:44:46.376
Don't look at me.

739
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:48.851
I'm qualified to give spiritual
guidance and the like.


740
00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:53.086
Escaping man-eating crocodiles
is not my speciality.


741
00:44:53.121 --> 00:44:56.089
We just need to kill
the bloody thing.


742
00:44:56.124 --> 00:45:00.027
So let's find a big gun
and shoot the bastard.


743
00:45:00.062 --> 00:45:04.394
And where do you propose
we get a gun from?


744
00:45:04.429 --> 00:45:08.134
There was a pair of
shotguns on the farm.


745
00:45:08.169 --> 00:45:10.169
Great.

746
00:45:10.204 --> 00:45:12.633
I'll just teleport to your
parents' farm then and get one,


747
00:45:12.668 --> 00:45:14.041
shall we?

748
00:45:14.076 --> 00:45:17.374
All right, guns are out.

749
00:45:17.409 --> 00:45:19.046
Are we going to kill this thing?

750
00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:20.850
We don't have to kill it.

751
00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:23.017
It's still one of
God's creatures.


752
00:45:23.052 --> 00:45:25.448
And it's clearly upset.

753
00:45:25.483 --> 00:45:27.120
It's upset?

754
00:45:27.155 --> 00:45:29.023
The crocodile is upset?

755
00:45:29.058 --> 00:45:31.520
Oh, that's all right then

756
00:45:31.555 --> 00:45:34.127
that everybody's dying,
because the crocodile


757
00:45:34.162 --> 00:45:36.162
is having a bad day.

758
00:45:36.197 --> 00:45:37.031
I didn't mean-

759
00:45:37.066 --> 00:45:39.198
I am upset, OK?

760
00:45:39.233 --> 00:45:42.564
In case you hadn't noticed,
my wedding day is ruined.


761
00:45:42.599 --> 00:45:45.039
And people we know are dead.

762
00:45:45.074 --> 00:45:47.635
Right.

763
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.275
Just calm down.

764
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.640
Don't tell me to calm down.

765
00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:01.682
At least we aren't
live streaming this.


766
00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:03.354
Can you imagine?

767
00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:06.390
At least then someone
would come to our rescue.


768
00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:17.032
Oh, god, I wish my dad was here.

769
00:46:20.406 --> 00:46:26.113
He'd know what to do, if
he's even still out there.


770
00:46:26.148 --> 00:46:28.016
If anyone knows how to
deal with a crocodile,


771
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:29.281
it's definitely your dad.

772
00:46:33.419 --> 00:46:33.989
Shit.

773
00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:34.891
It's Amy.

774
00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:01.643
Oh, my god.

775
00:47:01.678 --> 00:47:02.380
Fuck.

776
00:47:09.257 --> 00:47:09.992
Oh, shit.

777
00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:10.718
Shit.

778
00:47:10.753 --> 00:47:12.995
Come on, Amy, drive.

779
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.195
It's relentless.

780
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:22.301
Catch it?

781
00:47:22.336 --> 00:47:23.566
What do you mean, catch it?

782
00:47:23.601 --> 00:47:27.537
Exactly that-take it
to a zoo, and tag it.


783
00:47:27.572 --> 00:47:28.771
Really?

784
00:47:28.807 --> 00:47:31.541
So that thing has been rampage
at your daughter's wedding,


785
00:47:31.576 --> 00:47:33.246
killed I don't know
how many people,


786
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:36.084
and you want to catch
it and keep it as a pet?


787
00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:37.052
That's what I do.

788
00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:37.712
I protect animals.

789
00:47:37.747 --> 00:47:39.054
Protect them?

790
00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:41.419
What about the humans
that have died?


791
00:47:41.454 --> 00:47:46.094
So you don't care about humans.

792
00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:47.458
Some of them.

793
00:47:47.493 --> 00:47:49.328
Well, I bet you'd have a
different view if that thing


794
00:47:49.363 --> 00:47:51.693
got your daughter.

795
00:47:51.728 --> 00:47:53.398
She'll be fine.

796
00:47:53.433 --> 00:47:55.433
Not to put a damper on
things, but how do you know?


797
00:47:55.468 --> 00:47:57.336
That thing could have got
her like it got Tabby.


798
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:58.601
Practically bit her in half.

799
00:47:58.636 --> 00:48:00.108
And it got the camera
man and chewed him and...


800
00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:01.571
Because I know, all right.

801
00:48:04.576 --> 00:48:05.342
She'll be fine.

802
00:48:05.377 --> 00:48:07.115
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.


803
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.282
It didn't attack you.

804
00:48:09.317 --> 00:48:11.779
Yes, it did.

805
00:48:11.814 --> 00:48:13.715
Shit.

806
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.618
When did that happen?

807
00:48:15.653 --> 00:48:18.423
Earlier in the barn.

808
00:48:18.458 --> 00:48:19.688
Oh, god, it looks nasty.

809
00:48:19.723 --> 00:48:21.360
Let me take a look.

810
00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:25.331
Shit, there it is.

811
00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.503
Shit, Amy's in trouble.

812
00:48:34.804 --> 00:48:39.642
Heavenly father, we beseech
you to help our friend Amy


813
00:48:39.677 --> 00:48:40.743
in her time of need.

814
00:48:40.778 --> 00:48:44.317
Please forgive her her
sins, whatever they may be.


815
00:48:44.352 --> 00:48:48.585
And deliver her safely to
us, just like your son,


816
00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.127
our savior, Jesus Christ,
delivered us from evil.


817
00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:52.661
Amen.

818
00:48:55.363 --> 00:48:57.792
One question, reverend.

819
00:48:57.827 --> 00:49:00.498
Where was your holy father
when the crocodile started


820
00:49:00.533 --> 00:49:02.434
to kill everyone a minute ago?

821
00:49:05.703 --> 00:49:07.670
Why should he help Amy
what he didn't help them,


822
00:49:07.705 --> 00:49:11.377
or my parents,
wherever they are?


823
00:49:11.412 --> 00:49:13.379
Oh, I don't know.

824
00:49:13.414 --> 00:49:16.877
The Lord moves in
mysterious ways.


825
00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:19.484
Oh, yes, he does.

826
00:49:19.519 --> 00:49:27.519
He put a killer crocodile in
the middle of fucking Hampshire.


827
00:49:28.297 --> 00:49:30.231
It doesn't get much more
mysterious, does it?


828
00:49:30.266 --> 00:49:32.794
Charles, Amy is
in serious danger.


829
00:49:37.438 --> 00:49:39.570
This is where all that
yoga training pays off.


830
00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.783
You're safe now.

831
00:51:00.818 --> 00:51:03.225
Thank god.

832
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.986
No, thank my dad.

833
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:08.197
Did you see him?

834
00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:10.298
No, I just know that was him.

835
00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:11.365
Oh.

836
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.531
The crocodile is
still out there.


837
00:51:12.566 --> 00:51:16.799
So what are we going to do?

838
00:51:16.834 --> 00:51:17.503
We wait.

839
00:51:23.973 --> 00:51:27.579
Well, I guess we know what
happened to Georgie then.


840
00:51:30.683 --> 00:51:33.816
I just wish she'd told someone
before she wandered off


841
00:51:33.851 --> 00:51:35.257
on her own.

842
00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:36.984
That doesn't seem like her.

843
00:51:39.989 --> 00:51:41.527
That will be my dad.

844
00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:53.242
Oh.

845
00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:53.935
Oh, my god.

846
00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:54.804
You're all right.

847
00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:55.904
Did he get you?

848
00:51:55.939 --> 00:51:57.675
I'm fine.

849
00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.744
Oh, god, we need to find my dad.

850
00:52:19.028 --> 00:52:21.699
We need to get you
some proper first aid.


851
00:52:21.734 --> 00:52:22.767
OK.

852
00:52:22.802 --> 00:52:25.406
There might be a first
aid kit in the pool house.


853
00:52:25.441 --> 00:52:26.737
OK, let's go.

854
00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:27.540
Come on.

855
00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:45.987
I've got this.

856
00:53:22.927 --> 00:53:23.893
It's not pretty.

857
00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:27.798
I'm sorry.

858
00:53:27.833 --> 00:53:31.131
I can't deal with her being
in the pool like that.


859
00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:32.572
We'll move her in a minute.

860
00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:37.104
Right.

861
00:53:37.139 --> 00:53:39.073
Let's see what we can do.

862
00:53:39.108 --> 00:53:43.451
You know, I've never seen
this side to you before.


863
00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:47.015
I thought you were just this
womanizing playboy guy who


864
00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:50.623
told women he saved
leopards for a living.


865
00:53:50.658 --> 00:53:53.890
But I don't think
that's the real you.


866
00:53:53.925 --> 00:53:57.597
After my wife died,
I was the real me.


867
00:54:00.063 --> 00:54:02.767
It is the real me.

868
00:54:02.802 --> 00:54:04.340
Maybe you're living in the past.

869
00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:07.871
Maybe.

870
00:54:10.612 --> 00:54:12.007
There, try that.

871
00:54:14.682 --> 00:54:17.144
You know, for someone
without a proper job,


872
00:54:17.179 --> 00:54:18.079
you're pretty useful.

873
00:54:23.691 --> 00:54:26.593
Maybe we need to work
on your flirting a bit.


874
00:54:34.867 --> 00:54:36.999
It's Lisa.

875
00:54:37.034 --> 00:54:38.198
Where?

876
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:40.200
She's trying to send a message.

877
00:54:40.235 --> 00:54:40.904
Top window.

878
00:54:56.053 --> 00:54:57.756
Is that Morse code?

879
00:54:57.791 --> 00:55:00.088
Yeah, she remembers.

880
00:55:00.123 --> 00:55:01.628
Wow.

881
00:55:01.663 --> 00:55:03.597
What's she saying?

882
00:55:03.632 --> 00:55:05.533
Charlie's wounded.

883
00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:07.700
Are you OK?

884
00:55:07.735 --> 00:55:09.064
Thank god for text speak.

885
00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.234
Question for you, reverend.

886
00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:15.543
Yes.

887
00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:16.874
Being a man of the
cloth, why do you


888
00:55:16.909 --> 00:55:19.547
think God has done
something like this?


889
00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:23.045
If I say, he moves
in mysterious ways...


890
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.585
Wouldn't cut it.

891
00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.148
Well, then I don't
know, I'm afraid.


892
00:55:27.183 --> 00:55:28.556
I'm stumped.

893
00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.657
You don't think it's
because we're all evil,


894
00:55:30.692 --> 00:55:32.186
we deserve to die?

895
00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:32.857
No.

896
00:55:32.892 --> 00:55:33.187
No.

897
00:55:33.222 --> 00:55:33.858
No.

898
00:55:33.893 --> 00:55:34.659
No.

899
00:55:34.694 --> 00:55:36.223
There's lots of
good people here.


900
00:55:36.258 --> 00:55:36.927
There were.

901
00:55:43.705 --> 00:55:47.201
You know, I do wonder.

902
00:55:47.236 --> 00:55:49.203
All these natural disasters...

903
00:55:49.238 --> 00:55:55.011
Hurricanes, floods, fires...
People that survive,


904
00:55:55.046 --> 00:55:57.915
they often thank
God to be alive.


905
00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.687
But it's the ones that
die I think about.


906
00:56:00.722 --> 00:56:01.919
What did they do?

907
00:56:01.954 --> 00:56:04.152
If God sent the
hurricane and the floods,


908
00:56:04.187 --> 00:56:08.662
why did he let some people die
and some survive, you know?


909
00:56:08.697 --> 00:56:11.764
So what do you think
your purpose is here?


910
00:56:11.799 --> 00:56:13.667
Is this some kind of test?

911
00:56:13.702 --> 00:56:15.570
Or is it just a coincidence?

912
00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:18.705
I don't believe in
such thing as coincidences.


913
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.609
You do think it
happened for a reason.


914
00:56:21.644 --> 00:56:23.204
Whatever reasons they may be.

915
00:56:23.239 --> 00:56:24.777
Who knows?

916
00:56:24.812 --> 00:56:27.879
Maybe this is your moment,
your martyr moment.


917
00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:34.655
Maybe you're the
one that's going


918
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:37.251
to save us and deliver us.

919
00:56:37.286 --> 00:56:37.955
Maybe.

920
00:56:41.158 --> 00:56:42.124
Right.

921
00:56:42.159 --> 00:56:45.633
My dad is in the pool
house with Amy and V.


922
00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:47.294
The croc is doing
laps of this house.


923
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:51.639
So we just need to time it right
so we can get them over here.


924
00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.135
Where do you want me?

925
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.136
You stay here.

926
00:56:54.171 --> 00:56:56.809
You call to me as soon
as you see it coming.


927
00:56:56.844 --> 00:56:58.811
I'll signal to
them from upstairs.


928
00:56:58.846 --> 00:57:02.111
And then we just need
somebody by the back door.


929
00:57:02.146 --> 00:57:02.848
Allow me.

930
00:57:06.117 --> 00:57:06.753
OK.

931
00:57:16.897 --> 00:57:18.094
I'm not seeing it.

932
00:57:18.129 --> 00:57:19.766
It's going for the pool house.

933
00:57:29.778 --> 00:57:30.843
Wait.

934
00:57:30.878 --> 00:57:33.109
You don't think it's...

935
00:57:33.144 --> 00:57:35.342
Humans don't knock like that.

936
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.183
I've never seen a croc
use the door handle yet.


937
00:57:43.154 --> 00:57:43.922
Shit.

938
00:57:43.957 --> 00:57:45.022
We need to distract it.

939
00:57:45.057 --> 00:57:46.562
We need to get it
away from there.


940
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:51.325
Wait.

941
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.196
Oh, my god.

942
00:57:54.231 --> 00:57:54.867
Hey!

943
00:57:54.902 --> 00:57:56.297
Hey, crocodile!

944
00:57:56.332 --> 00:57:57.705
Come and get me!

945
00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.333
The reverend is using
himself as a decoy.


946
00:57:59.368 --> 00:58:02.138
You tell me as soon
as the coast is clear.


947
00:58:02.173 --> 00:58:04.404
Over here!

948
00:58:04.439 --> 00:58:06.340
OK, get ready.

949
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:28.329
Go.

950
00:58:28.364 --> 00:58:30.331
Come on.

951
00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:48.756
Hey.

952
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.757
Hey.

953
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.709
God does work in
mysterious ways.


954
00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:15.475
Easy.

955
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:16.949
Easy.

956
00:59:16.984 --> 00:59:18.786
What's wrong?

957
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:20.755
Just a bit of collateral damage.

958
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.790
I'll be fine.

959
00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:25.485
Hey.

960
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.763
So is this all of us?

961
00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.358
What are your thoughts?

962
00:59:30.393 --> 00:59:32.833
Why is this thing here?

963
00:59:32.868 --> 00:59:34.362
Did someone put it here?

964
00:59:34.397 --> 00:59:35.968
No.

965
00:59:36.003 --> 00:59:41.276
I found its nest, and
half a tent, and this.


966
00:59:45.012 --> 00:59:46.440
I don't know why it's here.

967
00:59:46.475 --> 00:59:48.277
I don't know how it survived.

968
00:59:48.312 --> 00:59:49.982
But that's why I
need to capture it.


969
00:59:50.017 --> 00:59:52.182
Capture it?

970
00:59:52.217 --> 00:59:52.919
Whoa.

971
00:59:52.954 --> 00:59:54.987
Like take it alive?

972
00:59:55.022 --> 00:59:57.154
Mate, I know you're all
for saving the wildlife.


973
00:59:57.189 --> 01:00:00.454
But that thing has killed dozens
of people, including my family.


974
01:00:00.489 --> 01:00:01.895
And it's trying to get us.

975
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:04.733
Now, if it's easier to
kill it, I say, kill it.


976
01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.801
I agree.

977
01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:11.839
Dad, I know you want to save
it, but that thing is dangerous.


978
01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:12.840
You're already injured.

979
01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.204
Can we please just be sensible?

980
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:22.542
If we can capture it, if it's
at all possible, let's do that.


981
01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:23.851
So now what?

982
01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.050
We stay put.

983
01:00:25.085 --> 01:00:27.415
We batten down the
hatches, keep it out.


984
01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:28.449
We've got food.

985
01:00:28.485 --> 01:00:30.891
We can survive until
someone comes to help us,


986
01:00:30.926 --> 01:00:33.861
or we can find some
opportunity to escape.


987
01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:37.898
In the meantime, we
shut and bolt the doors.


988
01:00:37.933 --> 01:00:38.899
We shut the windows.

989
01:00:38.934 --> 01:00:39.966
We double check them.

990
01:00:40.001 --> 01:00:41.462
And we make weapons...

991
01:00:41.497 --> 01:00:45.532
Knives, sticks, boiling water,
whatever we can... to hurt it,


992
01:00:45.567 --> 01:00:47.567
to slow it down, to trap it.

993
01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.470
We make this place a fortress.

994
01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.850
I don't see the point in this.

995
01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.082
It's a hotel.

996
01:00:57.117 --> 01:00:58.512
It's not like we're
going to find heavy duty


997
01:00:58.547 --> 01:01:01.988
rope or a tranquilizer gun.

998
01:01:02.023 --> 01:01:08.324
If you do find a tranquilizer
gun, use it on me.


999
01:01:08.359 --> 01:01:10.359
It's starting to sting a little.

1000
01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:34.955
Nothing up there but a
load of old bed sheets.


1001
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:36.990
I only found a couple
of kitchen knives.


1002
01:01:37.025 --> 01:01:40.488
I don't think anyone expected
this place to be under siege.


1003
01:01:40.523 --> 01:01:42.798
I found a fire poker
and croquet mallets.


1004
01:01:49.136 --> 01:01:51.103
What are these?

1005
01:01:51.138 --> 01:01:52.368
They're clothes.

1006
01:01:52.403 --> 01:01:55.503
They're your
clothes, aren't they?


1007
01:01:55.538 --> 01:01:56.944
Uh...

1008
01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.638
You were wearing
them last night.


1009
01:01:58.673 --> 01:01:59.848
I remember.

1010
01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.312
There are photos of us together.

1011
01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:05.183
So what were they doing
stashed downstairs?


1012
01:02:05.218 --> 01:02:09.121
I went on a walk last night
after everyone had gone to bed.


1013
01:02:09.156 --> 01:02:12.289
And I was a little drunk.

1014
01:02:12.324 --> 01:02:14.060
I couldn't see
where I was going.


1015
01:02:14.095 --> 01:02:17.591
And I walked face
first into the pond.


1016
01:02:17.626 --> 01:02:20.165
When I got back, I
threw them down there,


1017
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.497
because I didn't want anyone
to see me soaking wet.


1018
01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:30.604
I cut myself when
I was in the pond.


1019
01:02:30.639 --> 01:02:34.443
They've got to have a sign,
or a fence, or something.


1020
01:02:34.478 --> 01:02:35.015
It's insane.

1021
01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:37.017
Bullshit.

1022
01:02:37.052 --> 01:02:38.645
You were Georgie, weren't you?

1023
01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.086
No.

1024
01:02:40.121 --> 01:02:41.923
Don't lie to me.

1025
01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:42.957
I know you were with her.

1026
01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:44.288
Just tell me the truth.

1027
01:02:44.323 --> 01:02:47.995
I know you've always
had a thing for her.


1028
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.162
OK, we went on
the walk together.


1029
01:02:50.197 --> 01:02:52.428
But that's all that happened.

1030
01:02:52.463 --> 01:02:53.429
I swear.

1031
01:02:53.464 --> 01:02:58.599
The crocodile attacked
her, and I freaked out.


1032
01:02:58.634 --> 01:03:01.701
You fucking liar.

1033
01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:03.340
Do you know how I know?

1034
01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:06.574
Because I've told
plenty of lies.


1035
01:03:06.609 --> 01:03:09.643
I should drag you out there,
feed you to the fucking crocs.


1036
01:03:09.678 --> 01:03:12.019
Dad, stop, please.

1037
01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.350
Tell me why I shouldn't.

1038
01:03:13.385 --> 01:03:16.925
Punishment usually
needs to fit the crime.


1039
01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.684
Oh, it does.

1040
01:03:17.719 --> 01:03:20.126
Stop.

1041
01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:21.963
Enough people have died today.

1042
01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.459
We don't need to
go there, no matter


1043
01:03:23.494 --> 01:03:27.232
how much you think.

1044
01:03:27.267 --> 01:03:28.101
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:03:28.136 --> 01:03:30.532
It meant nothing.

1046
01:03:30.567 --> 01:03:33.535
God, what an excuse.

1047
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:38.144
So when you proposed to
me, did that mean nothing?


1048
01:03:38.179 --> 01:03:40.080
Or our wedding vows,
if we had got that far,


1049
01:03:40.115 --> 01:03:42.610
would they have meant nothing?

1050
01:03:42.645 --> 01:03:46.548
I'm so done with you.

1051
01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:47.252
Asshole.

1052
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:57.163
I'll be right back.

1053
01:03:57.198 --> 01:04:01.068
You, don't say a word.

1054
01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:04.401
And you, give me that.

1055
01:04:14.149 --> 01:04:19.086
My life is a mess, Amy.

1056
01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.417
God, it's a disaster.

1057
01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:26.291
I have a pointless
job that serves


1058
01:04:26.326 --> 01:04:30.064
no real purpose, something
my dad likes to remind me


1059
01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:33.430
of every time he sees me.

1060
01:04:33.465 --> 01:04:37.599
My wedding day has gone
from shit to worse.


1061
01:04:37.634 --> 01:04:39.667
And I just found
out that my fiancee


1062
01:04:39.702 --> 01:04:45.277
has been shagging one of
my friends, my friend who


1063
01:04:45.312 --> 01:04:46.377
is now dead.

1064
01:04:49.646 --> 01:04:53.483
And to top it off, we
are still being hunted


1065
01:04:53.518 --> 01:04:55.716
by the crocodile from hell.

1066
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:59.753
I'm not going to lie...

1067
01:04:59.788 --> 01:05:04.032
You're not living your
best life right now.


1068
01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.496
But your job isn't pointless.

1069
01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:09.697
Millions of people
appreciate what you do.


1070
01:05:09.732 --> 01:05:13.569
And as for Charlie, it's a
good job you found out now.


1071
01:05:13.604 --> 01:05:15.472
Imagine if you'd married him.

1072
01:05:15.507 --> 01:05:18.244
Once a cheat, always a cheat.

1073
01:05:18.279 --> 01:05:20.378
True.

1074
01:05:20.413 --> 01:05:22.182
We're going to avenge
your friend's death


1075
01:05:22.217 --> 01:05:24.646
and kill that damn crocodile.

1076
01:05:24.681 --> 01:05:26.054
Yeah.

1077
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.319
Good.

1078
01:05:27.354 --> 01:05:29.255
Is there anything else
I can help you with?


1079
01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:32.390
Yeah, make me a sandwich.

1080
01:05:32.425 --> 01:05:33.688
I'm fucking starving.

1081
01:06:07.526 --> 01:06:11.825
So what, we just wait
until someone finds us?


1082
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.300
I guess so.

1083
01:06:14.335 --> 01:06:17.204
It could take ages.

1084
01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:18.535
I know.

1085
01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:20.735
And we don't even have
the Wi-Fi to entertain us.


1086
01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:27.775
Oh, guess I'll make a..

1087
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:29.282
Good idea.

1088
01:06:29.317 --> 01:06:30.745
I'll see if anyone
else wants one.


1089
01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.573
It's in the house!

1090
01:06:56.608 --> 01:06:58.509
The crocodile's in the house!

1091
01:07:01.745 --> 01:07:03.448
It's inside.

1092
01:07:03.483 --> 01:07:04.251
It's down there.

1093
01:07:06.453 --> 01:07:08.453
It can't climb stairs, can it?

1094
01:07:08.488 --> 01:07:09.949
It'll figure them out.

1095
01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:11.720
We need to block the stairs.

1096
01:07:41.488 --> 01:07:43.917
Oh, fuck sake.

1097
01:07:45.624 --> 01:07:45.952
OK.

1098
01:07:46.955 --> 01:07:47.591
Well...

1099
01:07:47.626 --> 01:07:47.954
OK.

1100
01:07:50.761 --> 01:07:54.367
...That should stop it for now.

1101
01:07:54.402 --> 01:07:56.270
Lisa, are you OK?

1102
01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:58.734
Yeah, we're all right.

1103
01:07:58.769 --> 01:08:01.209
I'm not sure I trust
this door, though.


1104
01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:01.935
Stay there.

1105
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:03.376
I'll figure it out.

1106
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.315
You guys OK?

1107
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.811
Yeah.

1108
01:08:09.846 --> 01:08:10.512
What now?

1109
01:08:10.547 --> 01:08:13.419
I have a revolver in the car.

1110
01:08:13.454 --> 01:08:15.949
You've had a gun
this whole time?


1111
01:08:15.984 --> 01:08:17.951
I keep it for emergencies.

1112
01:08:17.986 --> 01:08:21.922
And it's only just now
become an emergency?


1113
01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:23.693
Yeah, there's one problem.

1114
01:08:23.728 --> 01:08:25.728
The keys are on the
stand next to my coat.


1115
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:45.044
That's the end of it.

1116
01:08:45.079 --> 01:08:45.748
Yeah.

1117
01:08:54.429 --> 01:08:55.593
Come on then.

1118
01:09:00.699 --> 01:09:02.061
Where the fuck's the croc?

1119
01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:03.271
I don't know.

1120
01:09:09.037 --> 01:09:13.710
We got them!

1121
01:09:16.748 --> 01:09:17.978
I'm going out the window.

1122
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:25.524
Good luck.

1123
01:10:31.955 --> 01:10:33.526
Cock it.

1124
01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:34.120
Undo safety.

1125
01:11:50.737 --> 01:11:54.134
Dylan, kill this thing now!

1126
01:12:00.076 --> 01:12:03.682
Dad, what was that?

1127
01:12:06.214 --> 01:12:11.558
That.

1128
01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:15.793
Now, listen, it's
up to you to now.


1129
01:12:15.828 --> 01:12:18.631
You're going to have to
work out how to kill it.


1130
01:12:18.666 --> 01:12:22.228
Remember everything
I've taught you.


1131
01:12:22.263 --> 01:12:24.263
Use your initiative.

1132
01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:26.573
I know you can do it.

1133
01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:27.101
OK.

1134
01:12:37.113 --> 01:12:38.585
All right, think.

1135
01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.245
Think.

1136
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.048
What do we have?

1137
01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:43.491
What can we use?

1138
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.790
You lure it in.

1139
01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:49.497
I'll cave it's
head in with this.


1140
01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:51.026
You're on your own there.

1141
01:12:51.061 --> 01:12:51.960
No.

1142
01:12:51.996 --> 01:12:54.194
No, I think we need
less direct methods.


1143
01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.239
Glass will slow it down.

1144
01:13:06.274 --> 01:13:09.077
Yeah, but then what?

1145
01:13:16.823 --> 01:13:19.318
We set fire to it.

1146
01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.925
I like the way you think.

1147
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.928
And we have flares.

1148
01:13:24.963 --> 01:13:29.867
So we take the flares, and we
guide it to an outbuilding,


1149
01:13:29.902 --> 01:13:32.804
and shut the door,
and set fire to it.


1150
01:13:32.839 --> 01:13:34.740
We could use the pool house.

1151
01:13:34.775 --> 01:13:36.940
We could drop it in the pool.

1152
01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:37.507
No.

1153
01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:39.140
No, it'd just climb out.

1154
01:13:39.175 --> 01:13:40.174
Well, can we drain it?

1155
01:13:45.984 --> 01:13:47.115
Maybe we don't have to.

1156
01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.325
What's that?

1157
01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.834
It's venison from Neil's farm.

1158
01:14:02.869 --> 01:14:05.903
It's supposed to be for dinner.

1159
01:14:05.938 --> 01:14:08.301
Well, don't fuck this up.

1160
01:14:08.336 --> 01:14:10.875
I mean, shame to waste it.

1161
01:14:25.155 --> 01:14:26.154
Make her proud.

1162
01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:13.162
Come on.

1163
01:16:13.197 --> 01:16:13.866
Come on.

1164
01:16:23.141 --> 01:16:24.338
Guide it in the pool.

1165
01:16:31.314 --> 01:16:33.754
Over here!

1166
01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.256
Come on!

1167
01:16:50.036 --> 01:16:52.168
I'm in the.

1168
01:16:58.539 --> 01:16:59.505
Go.

1169
01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.506
Go.

1170
01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:01.210
Go.

1171
01:17:05.183 --> 01:17:06.479
Go!

1172
01:17:06.514 --> 01:17:07.183
Go!

1173
01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.523
It's.

1174
01:17:59.534 --> 01:18:00.940
You're late.

1175
01:18:00.975 --> 01:18:02.205
What can I say?

1176
01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.569
You two make a great team.

1177
01:18:07.047 --> 01:18:08.442
Thank fuck for that.

1178
01:18:17.387 --> 01:18:19.024
We need to get
you to a hospital.


1179
01:18:19.059 --> 01:18:21.224
A hospital?

1180
01:18:21.259 --> 01:18:22.458
Yes.

1181
01:18:22.494 --> 01:18:25.866
Your leg's about to drop off,
and I want you in one piece.


1182
01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:27.934
You want me in one piece?

1183
01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:29.298
Please may I have?

1184
01:18:40.146 --> 01:18:42.641
You all right?

1185
01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:43.345
Don't even.

1186
01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:48.922
I'm sorry, darling.

1187
01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.286
Look at it this way...
