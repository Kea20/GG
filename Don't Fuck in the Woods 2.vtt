22
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.931
Gil.

23
00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:25.108
[Walter] Hey there.

24
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.298
Hey Walter.

25
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.050
[Walter] How ya
hanging in there?

26
00:07:28.932 --> 00:07:30.498
Well just walking the grounds.

27
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.331
Jesus Christ, Walter,

28
00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:33.918
how'd you keep this
place open for so long?

29
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.068
I'm seeing like six or
seven code violations.

30
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.538
The damn cabins
are falling apart.

31
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.908
[Walter] Well friend,
that's why we have you there.

32
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.988
I need that campsite up
and running within a week.

33
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.888
And given your
current situation,

34
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.798
I didn't figure some hard
work and fresh air would hurt.

35
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.208
That wasn't me
complaining, Walter.

36
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.760
[Walter] I know, Gil, I know.

37
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.128
Walter, this nurse and
these kids, they know about...

38
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.042
[Walter] They know
that you're a handyman

39
00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.438
and that's all
they need to know.

40
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.608
Walter...

41
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.048
[Walter] They don't
need to know anything else

42
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.473
other than you and Miss
Hemsgrove are in charge.

43
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.598
So they're showing up today?

44
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.448
[Walter] They should be
there within the next few hours,

45
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.348
Gil, just do me a favor.

46
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.338
What?

47
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.158
[Walter] They're barely
old enough to drink,

48
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.373
so be patient with 'em.

49
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.868
- Great.
- You'll be fine.

50
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.628
Listen, I'm gonna jump off here,

51
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.238
I just wanted to check
in and make sure

52
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.768
everything was
going okay for ya.

53
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.601
Thanks Walter.

54
00:08:26.603 --> 00:08:27.434
[Walter] Don't mention it.

55
00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:28.838
I'll call you
tomorrow to check in.

56
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.671
Have a good one.

57
00:08:29.673 --> 00:08:30.937
You too.

58
00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:34.356
(gentle, dramatic music)

59
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.853
Shit.

60
00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:47.012
(insects singing)
(gentle, dramatic music)

61
00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:53.123

(gravel crackling)
(gentle, dramatic music)

63
00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:11.993
(hammer thumping)
(gravel crackling)

64
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.030
[Woman] Excuse
me, we're a little lost.

65
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.128
Uh... (women giggle)

66
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.938
Yeah, where you tryin' to find?

67
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.593
Uh, Brook Haven Metro Park?

68
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.271
Uh, (chuckles) it's
um, five miles that way.

69
00:09:27.273 --> 00:09:29.038
(women giggle)

70
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.990
- Thank you.
- Oh.

71
00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:34.882
(gentle, dramatic music)

72
00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:44.666
(hammer thumping)

73
00:09:46.271 --> 00:09:50.271
(upbeat, energetic, rock music)

74
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:59.678
(hammer thumping)
(energetic, rock music)

75
00:10:07.886 --> 00:10:10.553
(doors clatter)

76
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.778
My friends, we have arrived.

77
00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.088
(woman talking
quietly) (door clatters)

78
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.178
[Charlie] Perfect setting
for several days of food,

79
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.483
booze and debauchery.

80
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.168
We can talk about
the first two, but,

81
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.248
let's take it easy
on the latter.

82
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.208
Well hello Mr. Tall
Drink of Water.

83
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.043
Who is you?

84
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.838
I believe that
would be Mr. Gil.

85
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.698
He's in charge of the
construction program.

86
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.271
[Tasha] Is that a
first or a last name?

87
00:10:38.273 --> 00:10:39.104
Why don't you
guys get settled in?

88
00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:40.433
I'm gonna go talk with him.

89
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.738
Um, and just to be clear,

90
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.115
there is plenty of
room in my bunk

91
00:10:49.117 --> 00:10:50.653
for you two fine-ass women.

92
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.078
Her loss, I guess that just
leaves you, Hannah Montana.

93
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.980
Yeah, I'd rather sleep on
salty, glass-covered pavement.

94
00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:02.759
(gravel crackling)

95
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.500
[Vanessa] Hello.

96
00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:09.768
[Gil] Hey.

97
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.768
[Vanessa] Vanessa
Hemsgrove, I'll be your acting...

98
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.091
Nurse, yeah, Walter told me.

99
00:11:14.093 --> 00:11:16.518
And you must be Gillum Ross?

100
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.708
Just Gil.

101
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.078
Well Walter's had
nothing but great things

102
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.568
to say about you, Gil.

103
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.420
[Gil] Likewise.

104
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.048
Um, just thought I'd
come introduce myself

105
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.850
since we're gonna be working
together the next few days.

106
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.463
Well, I don't wanna disturb you.

107
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.188
Uh, just be careful
out there, all right?

108
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.045
What do you mean?

109
00:11:37.047 --> 00:11:39.138
Oh, I haven't walked
the rest of the grounds yet,

110
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.228
so I've already found some
hazards, so there'll be others.

111
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.538
Just be careful, and if you
find a hazard, come to me.

112
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.712
Understood.

113
00:11:46.714 --> 00:11:47.545
And, it would be kind of bad

114
00:11:47.547 --> 00:11:49.398
if something happened
to our site nurse, right?

115
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.371
No, we wouldn't want
that now, would we?

116
00:11:51.373 --> 00:11:54.178
Someone's liable to get
a band aid on an ankle, so.

117
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.053
Duly noted.

118
00:11:57.574 --> 00:12:00.157
(door rattles)

119
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.153
Welcome to the
Pine Hilton, boys.

120
00:12:05.194 --> 00:12:06.494
[Charlie] (chuckles) No.

121
00:12:09.155 --> 00:12:12.374
Did you get a side of
tetanus shot with this cabin?

122
00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:15.209
(insects singing)

123
00:12:16.288 --> 00:12:18.871
(door squeaks)

124
00:12:20.386 --> 00:12:23.686
(switch clicks)

125
00:12:23.688 --> 00:12:26.271
(door squeaks)

126
00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:31.213
(bags rustling)

127
00:12:33.735 --> 00:12:35.624
(zipper buzzes)
(door clatters)

128
00:12:35.626 --> 00:12:36.457
(chuckles) Daddy's home.

129
00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:38.863
Ew, dude, get
the fuck outta here.

130
00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:40.308
What, you know you want me in.

131
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.143
Bye Charlie.

132
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.638
So, what are you
ladies up to today?

133
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.458
Uh, we're probably
gonna lay out.

134
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.628
[Courtney] Yep.

135
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.578
I think I'm gonna go
see what Mason's up to.

136
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.958
Obvious much?

137
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.793
What?

138
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.604
Mason is a hunter.

139
00:12:56.606 --> 00:12:57.918
(laughs) Mason doesn't hunt.

140
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.598
Jesus fucking Christ,

141
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.398
guys like Mason
like the unobtainable.

142
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.713
They like the
thrill of the chase.

143
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.878
Okay.

144
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.880
Okay, so he's a lion, and
you're a fucking elephant.

145
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.068
I'm not fat.

146
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.648
For fuck sake, Mason
takes one look at you

147
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.238
and he knows he can have you

148
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.128
because, like an
elephant, you're just there,

149
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.148
and fucking obvious.

150
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:28.150
Mason wants a gazelle that he
can chase down and tear apart.

151
00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:33.073
(sighs) Well,

152
00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:36.678
(claps hands) I'm gonna
go get some work done.

153
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.230
You girls have a good day.

154
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.249
(door rattles)

155
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:45.501
(quiet, ominous music)

156
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:17.191
(engine humming)
(quiet, ominous music)

157
00:14:21.702 --> 00:14:23.550
(keys clink) (rattle)

158
00:14:23.552 --> 00:14:25.478
[Driver] Well, this
could just have to do.

159
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.300
Well, right to life, right?

160
00:14:27.302 --> 00:14:28.635
[Driver] Yeah.

161
00:14:31.032 --> 00:14:34.198
(doors clatter)

162
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.910
(woman sighs)

163
00:14:35.912 --> 00:14:37.908
(leaves crackling)

164
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.988
Well I'm sure we'll
find some great spots

165
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.625
to take some photo shots.

166
00:14:41.627 --> 00:14:43.345
Yes, I think so.

167
00:14:43.347 --> 00:14:48.347
(leaves crackling)
(quiet, ominous music)

168
00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:02.176
(upbeat, rock music)
(hammer thunking)

169
00:15:02.178 --> 00:15:04.178
(Courtney chuckles)
- That was really rude.

170
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.668
That's not what I meant,
she took it the wrong way.

171
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.670
(hammer thunking)
(upbeat, rock music)

172
00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:37.446
What are you
looking at my girls for?

173
00:15:37.448 --> 00:15:39.951
(upbeat, rock music)

174
00:15:39.953 --> 00:15:42.242
(hand smacks ass)

175
00:15:42.244 --> 00:15:47.244
(men horse playing)
(upbeat, rock music)

176
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.713
(insects singing)

177
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.403
[Woman] Harper.

178
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.543
I'm gonna find you.

179
00:16:09.793 --> 00:16:14.793
(insects singing)
(quiet, dramatic music)

180
00:16:49.061 --> 00:16:53.147
Oh, I see what game
we're playing now, huh.

181
00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:58.149
(ominous, rhythmic
music) (insects singing)

182
00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:12.158
[Blond] You found me.

183
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.410
[Nicole] What do I win?

184
00:17:14.322 --> 00:17:16.322
You might just win me.

185
00:17:17.172 --> 00:17:20.553
(giggles) I like that.

186
00:17:20.555 --> 00:17:22.055
Oh, I like that.

187
00:17:26.906 --> 00:17:31.106
Oh. (Giggles)

188
00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:34.944
(blond sighs)

189
00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:37.368
(blond giggles)

190
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.787
(rhythmic, upbeat music)

191
00:17:49.904 --> 00:17:52.487
(Nicole moans)

192
00:17:53.563 --> 00:17:56.148
[Miley] It says here
that 65% of all people

193
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.638
have sex while they're camping.

194
00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.185
You get service out here?

195
00:17:59.187 --> 00:18:00.018
Yeah.

196
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.338
Bullshit, there's no way.

197
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.171
Why?

198
00:18:03.173 --> 00:18:04.508
Because it's a proven fact

199
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.808
that once people get away
from the fuss of civilization,

200
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.548
they let their primal
side come out.

201
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.958
This number's gotta be higher.

202
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.088
How much higher?

203
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.071
95%, at least.

204
00:18:14.073 --> 00:18:15.338
Eh, I highly doubt it.

205
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.678
Why, I mean, think about it,

206
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.338
campfire, peace and quiet,

207
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.660
nobody around for miles,
primal instincts kick in, baby.

208
00:18:22.662 --> 00:18:23.493
(men chuckle)
- Well,

209
00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:26.151
you obviously don't
understand how pussy works.

210
00:18:26.153 --> 00:18:31.153
(rhythmic, upbeat music)
(Nicole moaning quietly)

211
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.028
Yeah, not to mention it'd
be, like, super uncomfortable.

212
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.148
I mean, scraped knees, elbows,

213
00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.838
branches and
rocks under you, eh.

214
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.951
You need to shut that shit down.

215
00:18:51.953 --> 00:18:53.728
It just means you're not
doing it right, Courtney.

216
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.728
Always be on top.

217
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.561
- That's right.
- Good point.

218
00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:58.122
That's right, always be on top.

219
00:18:58.124 --> 00:19:01.241
And by the way, they make
stereotypes about this thing

220
00:19:01.243 --> 00:19:02.610
in horror movies and stuff,

221
00:19:02.612 --> 00:19:04.250
and there's gotta be a
reason for that, right?

222
00:19:04.252 --> 00:19:05.083
Yeah. (Courtney laughs)

223
00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:06.678
Yeah, and girls just love it

224
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.888
when you stick it up their
ass, just like in porn, too.

225
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.390
- No.
- Really?

226
00:19:10.392 --> 00:19:11.238
- No.
- Really.

227
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.528
No, I was being fascist.

228
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.980
Facetious.

229
00:19:14.982 --> 00:19:16.231
(chuckles) Whatever.

230
00:19:16.233 --> 00:19:20.369
(upbeat, rhythmic music)
(accelerated breathing)

231
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:22.039
(Nicole gasps)

232
00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:24.541
(sighs) Hey Charlie,
grab me that bottle of SPF.

233
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.413
Today, preferably.

234
00:19:27.415 --> 00:19:28.915
Whoa, hey tiger.

235
00:19:30.026 --> 00:19:32.088
(men mutter)

236
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.403
Don't miss my shoulders.

237
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.098
I mean, don't get
me wrong, though,

238
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.478
if I was walking
through the woods

239
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.608
and that Gil guy showed up...

240
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.808
That guy?

241
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.678
He's like 40!

242
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.441
Not to mention, he's as bald
as Tasha's stabbing cabin.

243
00:19:46.443 --> 00:19:49.758
(laughs) Okay, I really
like bald guys and he's older,

244
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.518
which means he doesn't
have to be trained as much.

245
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.761
Amen to that. (Grunts)

246
00:19:53.763 --> 00:19:56.048
Just right in there, bro',
just right, (pops tongue)

247
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.563
Yeah bro', get in there.

248
00:19:58.742 --> 00:20:00.615
(Nicole gasping)
(upbeat, rhythmic music)

249
00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.124
You like that, baby?

250
00:20:02.126 --> 00:20:04.215
(Nicole gasping)
Nicole, Nicole!

251
00:20:04.217 --> 00:20:08.701
(foot thunks)
(Nicole gasping)

252
00:20:08.703 --> 00:20:11.020
(laughs) Charlie's got mahogany.

253
00:20:11.022 --> 00:20:12.701
(men laughing)
- What?

254
00:20:12.703 --> 00:20:15.468
(laughs) Dude, it
was like 10 seconds.

255
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.632
It's human nature, it's primal.

256
00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:21.010
(group laughing)

257
00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.381
[Tasha] You underwhelm me.

258
00:20:22.383 --> 00:20:26.566
Oh. (Laughs)

259
00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:31.861
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with this?

260
00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.478
[Tasha] Prove to us you're
not a two-pump chump.

261
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.930
[Charlie] Come the fuck on.

262
00:20:38.392 --> 00:20:40.450
How about you and I
take a walk over there?

263
00:20:40.452 --> 00:20:41.832
Mm, walk huh?

264
00:20:41.834 --> 00:20:44.008
- Mm hmm.
- Mmm, is that all?

265
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.592
Oh no, I'm pretty sure we
can figure other things to do.

266
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:50.221
- Mm, oh yeah?
- Oh yeah.

267
00:20:50.223 --> 00:20:53.056
(insects singing)

268
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.408
What's happening, hot stuff?

269
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.538
I thought you guys went
to lay out or something?

270
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.228
We were, but
Charlie got religion

271
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.233
while putting sunscreen on me.

272
00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:11.084
What?

273
00:21:11.086 --> 00:21:12.268
I can't reach my back.

274
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.103
Uh huh.

275
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.548
It's not what you think.

276
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.168
Oh sure.

277
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.718
You know what, I don't
think you're as immune

278
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.533
to the rigors of careless
sex after all, Nurse Betty.

279
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.558
Contrary to popular belief,

280
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.115
there are more important
things to talk about than just sex.

281
00:21:29.117 --> 00:21:30.117
Really, like what?

282
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.008
Like fixing this cabin.

283
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.368
And Mr. Gil is doing a great
job adhering to all the rules

284
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.835
and I think we should
follow his example.

285
00:21:39.837 --> 00:21:44.837
(engine humming)
(hammer thumping)

286
00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:54.646
(birds chirping)
(insects singing)

287
00:21:55.627 --> 00:21:56.705
(door clatters)

288
00:21:56.707 --> 00:21:57.540
Well,

289
00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:02.778
looks pretty nice.

290
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:05.893
I like it out here.

291
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.373
This is nice,

292
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.533
real nice.

293
00:22:12.474 --> 00:22:14.391
Help you with something?

294
00:22:14.393 --> 00:22:18.459
[Officer] Got a nice
setup out here, huh?

295
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:19.340
It's all right.

296
00:22:19.342 --> 00:22:21.038
(chuckles) All right?

297
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.688
Yeah, I'll say it's all right.

298
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:27.643
Jesus, wide, open space,
freedom to go about your day,

299
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.220
I bet you get a nice workout
out here too, don't ya?

300
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.098
[Gil] Sure.

301
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.933
Sure.

302
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.178
Yeah, it's really nice.

303
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.148
Oh, and the poon
walking around here,

304
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.863
holy Mary mother of fuck.

305
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.153
Bet you're just in Heaven
out here, aren't you?

306
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.788
Come on, Gil, you can't tell me

307
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.908
the thought hasn't
crossed your mind.

308
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.738
After five years, I would've
thought you would have

309
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.215
worn one of these fur burgers
as a flesh condom by now.

310
00:22:57.217 --> 00:22:58.228
Are you kidding?

311
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.028
Look at him, he would
wanna bitch any one of us

312
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.398
if given the opportunity.

313
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.231
You can see it in his eyes.

314
00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:05.611
I seriously doubt that.

315
00:23:05.613 --> 00:23:07.640
Well, we'll see about that.

316
00:23:07.642 --> 00:23:11.088
(chuckles) Gil is
way too old for you.

317
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.968
So was my therapist.

318
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:13.801
God.

319
00:23:13.803 --> 00:23:15.848
Uh, five oh is here.

320
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.458
Did somebody order bacon?

321
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.883
[Vanessa] I have no idea.

322
00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:26.313
Ah, there he is.

323
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.383
What's wrong, push your button?

324
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.308
No sir.

325
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.578
No sir?

326
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.530
That's really good.

327
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.368
See, it'd a been a
shame if you timed out

328
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.483
to go right back in,
assaulting an officer of the law.

329
00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:42.581
Know what I mean?

330
00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:44.035
Is there something I
can help you with, officer?

331
00:23:44.037 --> 00:23:45.318
And you are?

332
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.928
[Vanessa] Vanessa Hemsgrove,
the nurse here at the camp.

333
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.651
Mrs. Hemsgrove.

334
00:23:49.653 --> 00:23:50.484
Miss.

335
00:23:50.486 --> 00:23:52.878
Ah Miss, well, no
need to be alarmed,

336
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.938
just taking up my
friend, Gil here,

337
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.928
standard procedure to
keep tabs on ex-cons.

338
00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.703
Wait, so this guy's an ex-con?

339
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.718
They can't be around
girls and such, right?

340
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.288
Depends on what
they were locked up for.

341
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.011
Mr. Gil's doing a find job.

342
00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:10.443
(laughs) Mr. Gil.

343
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.298
That's cute.

344
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.248
You're interrupting
Mr. Gil's job,

345
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.428
so if there was something,

346
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.040
someone you'd
like to speak with...

347
00:24:18.042 --> 00:24:20.792
No no no, that's not necessary.

348
00:24:31.512 --> 00:24:34.179
(door clatters)

349
00:24:35.842 --> 00:24:37.868
You behave yourself, Gil,

350
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.028
I don't wanna get
any phone calls

351
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.058
from any of these fine ladies,

352
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.268
saying that you've misbehaved.

353
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.103
We clear?

354
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.923
Crystal.

355
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.960
Well that's good.

356
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.233
All righty, you folks
have a great day.

357
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.573
We'll see you soon, Mr. Gil.

358
00:24:58.218 --> 00:25:00.123
[Vanessa] Don't you
got something to do?

359
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.921
Tsk tsk tsk, naughty boy.

360
00:25:03.923 --> 00:25:05.980
[Vanessa] Go.

361
00:25:05.982 --> 00:25:08.617
(mutters) We got stuff to, do.

362
00:25:17.763 --> 00:25:21.471
(knife patters)
(liquid burbles)

363
00:25:21.473 --> 00:25:26.473
(quiet, ominous
music) (insects singing)

364
00:25:28.313 --> 00:25:31.841
(lighter clicking)

365
00:25:31.843 --> 00:25:34.760
(flames crackling)

366
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

367
00:25:39.748 --> 00:25:40.579
(chair rattles)

368
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:42.228
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

369
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.718
There she is.

370
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.018
[Vanessa] Yeah yeah,
so what's the skinny?

371
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.968
The skinny, people
still say shit like that?

372
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.358
Yes, just 'cause
I'm a little older

373
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.179
doesn't mean I don't
still know the hip lingo.

374
00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:55.615
(group giggles)
- Yeah, the hip lingo, okay.

375
00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.528
No uh,

376
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.628
we were actually just
discussing our ex-con handyman.

377
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.108
Listen, I get you guys

378
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:07.298
may be a little confused
or on edge, but trust me,

379
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.168
you literally have
nothing to worry about.

380
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.573
Why, just 'cause the
boss-man said it's cool?

381
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.118
Yeah, that makes me
feel so much better.

382
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.008
Things like this is normal.

383
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.478
Sometimes when
people's been in the system,

384
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.867
they need a little
assistance on a job and Mr.,

385
00:26:22.734 --> 00:26:24.318
I mean, he's been
staying to himself.

386
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.008
Just leave him alone.

387
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.998
All I know is people like that

388
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.138
have a lot of pent up
aggression and shit.

389
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.653
Oh yeah, and how many
ex-con men do you know?

390
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.078
That's what I thought.

391
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.178
And you too, weren't
you just saying

392
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.368
you were into his
sexy, working man vibe,

393
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.318
literally a few hours ago?

394
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.071
(clears throat)
Yeah, you were.

395
00:26:43.073 --> 00:26:45.598
That was before they knew
he got locked up, though.

396
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.300
I think it just makes it sexier.

397
00:26:49.581 --> 00:26:53.691
Always a sucker for
the bad boys, huh Tasha?

398
00:26:53.693 --> 00:26:57.308
Lay off Gil already,
he's keeping to himself,

399
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.498
we don't need you all
making it a little bit awkward.

400
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.698
I still wanna know
what he was locked up for.

401
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.088
My bet's drugs.

402
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.418
I think he got caught running.

403
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.990
Nah, he looks like a
breaking and entering guy.

404
00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:07.918
(Gil whistles)
(dramatic music)

405
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.968
Jesus Christ, creep much?

406
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.801
Miley.

407
00:27:11.803 --> 00:27:12.636
What?

408
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.373
I just came to
check out the fire.

409
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.973
(quiet, dramatic music)

410
00:27:25.004 --> 00:27:26.698
So come on, Gil, what'd
you get locked up for?

411
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.388
[Vanessa] That's
none of your business.

412
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.808
Well, about five years ago,

413
00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.783
friend of mine,
came, asked for help,

414
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.663
he got in with some bad
people, owed a lot of money.

415
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:40.723
What's a lot?

416
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:44.208
About 500.

417
00:27:45.044 --> 00:27:47.613
(chuckles) $500,
that's not a lot.

418
00:27:48.897 --> 00:27:50.459
$500,000.

419
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:51.628
- Fuck.
- Damn.

420
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.058
So what happened?

421
00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.208
Well, he came to me, had
a plan about scrapping cars

422
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.508
to make money
to pay the debt off.

423
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.758
Doesn't sound like you'd
make that much money.

424
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.588
I mean, not $500,000.

425
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.048
Well it wouldn't, but if you
can make cars disappear,

426
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.318
it would.

427
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.363
Cars that belong
to very bad people.

428
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.370
And so that's what we did,
we made cars disappear.

429
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.598
Wait a second, you're
telling me you ran a chop shop?

430
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.433
We did.

431
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.518
And the money
flowed in like a flood.

432
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.120
He was able to pay off his debt.

433
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.038
Should a stopped though.

434
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:33.873
We didn't.

435
00:28:34.904 --> 00:28:36.428
We got greedy.

436
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:37.730
So how'd you get caught?

437
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.048
Eh, it seems we weren't
as close as I thought we were.

438
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.423
Cops got wind of the
operation, brought him in,

439
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.838
basically offered him a deal

440
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.488
which would pin the
whole thing on me.

441
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.540
So he sold you out.

442
00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.658
Damn dude, that is cold blooded.

443
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.488
Yeah, he uh,
basically got probation

444
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.798
and I got 10 years,
sentenced to state prison,

445
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.143
Lebanon State Prison,

446
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.700
served five, got out
on good behavior.

447
00:29:06.944 --> 00:29:08.594
(chuckles non-humorously) Fuck.

448
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.508
To Gil.

449
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.870
The unluckiest car-killer alive.

450
00:29:16.872 --> 00:29:19.789
(glasses clinking)

451
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:23.958
Hey, where are you
two headed off to,

452
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.571
the party's just
getting started.

453
00:29:25.573 --> 00:29:27.298
Eh, we're gonna
take a little stroll

454
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.708
and make a little
party of our own.

455
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.419
Now guys, stay
close, take a flashlight.

456
00:29:32.421 --> 00:29:36.898
But if we're too close,
you'll hear us. (Giggles)

457
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.558
Try to keep some
reservations about yourselves.

458
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.318
Yeah, and uh, watch out
for snakes and Poison Ivy,

459
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.262
and um, herpes.

460
00:29:45.264 --> 00:29:46.958
(groups laughs)
- Fuck you, douche schnakal.

461
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.328
Hey, if that's an offer, I
am down for a love sandwich.

462
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.016
Courtney, you can
be the roast beef.

463
00:29:51.018 --> 00:29:52.405
Oh. (Laughs)

464
00:29:52.407 --> 00:29:54.585
(group laughing)

465
00:29:54.587 --> 00:29:55.504
Fuck off.

466
00:29:56.999 --> 00:29:58.168
Roast beef? (Laughs)

467
00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:59.920
I know you love
roast beef, dude.

468
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.558
Listen, roast beef,
(laughs) wait here,

469
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.138
count to 10, and then follow
the trail and come find me.

470
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.229
Why?

471
00:30:12.231 --> 00:30:13.368
'Cause I have
a surprise for you.

472
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.498
What kind of surprise?

473
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.683
It's gonna be a big surprise,
it's gonna blow your mind.

474
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.863
Okay. (Laughs)

475
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.173
So you're in to bad boys?

476
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:30.423
I could be a bad boy.

477
00:30:31.522 --> 00:30:36.522
(insects singing)
(fire crackling)

478
00:30:44.841 --> 00:30:46.578
Where you headed off to?

479
00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.499
Anywhere you're
not. (Hands slap legs)

480
00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:54.501
(fire crackling)
(insects singing)

481
00:31:03.768 --> 00:31:05.003
Tah dah!

482
00:31:05.005 --> 00:31:05.836
[Courtney] (giggles) What?

483
00:31:05.838 --> 00:31:06.708
Yeah?

484
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.718
You wanna get in the tent
or you wanna mull it over?

485
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.809
[Courtney] Oh
my God. (Laughs)

486
00:31:10.811 --> 00:31:12.967
Get in. (Zipper buzzing)

487
00:31:12.969 --> 00:31:14.993
(mutters) (grunts)
Yeah see, look.

488
00:31:16.127 --> 00:31:17.448
I brought a bag of toys.
- Oh.

489
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.143
And bug-free.

490
00:31:19.989 --> 00:31:23.685
All right, so I
admit, I like the tent,

491
00:31:23.687 --> 00:31:26.376
but explain this.
- What?

492
00:31:26.378 --> 00:31:27.209
Oh this.
- Yeah.

493
00:31:27.211 --> 00:31:29.818
Oh, you know how
cosplay is my kink.

494
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.651
- Uh huh.
- Yeah,

495
00:31:30.653 --> 00:31:31.847
you remember the
thing with the fairies?

496
00:31:31.849 --> 00:31:32.680
- Mm hmm.
- Shh,

497
00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:34.008
let's not talk about that,
it was a dark time for us.

498
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.848
But this, like look,
we're out in the woods,

499
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.648
it's like an 80's movie
with the hockey masks

500
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.198
and the stabbings
and things like that,

501
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.468
and I'm like the unruly
camper and you're like

502
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.199
the hot, sexy, camp counselor
that I'm just tryin' to fuck.

503
00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:47.032
Yeah.

504
00:31:47.034 --> 00:31:48.588
(chuckles) Don't they
usually die in those movies?

505
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.298
Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.

506
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.398
(laughs) That's when they die.

507
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.808
Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.

508
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:53.648
[Courtney] Oh my God.

509
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.593
Oh, or, I could
be a bounty hunter.

510
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.178
[Courtney] Okay,
now we're talkin'.

511
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.280
You're under arrest.

512
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.358
You have the right
to remain naked,

513
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.170
you take that off
and I'll take this off,

514
00:32:07.172 --> 00:32:08.418
'cause I have that right too.

515
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.668
It's equal rights around here.

516
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.668
You have the right,
give me this, goddamn it.

517
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.527
Just take that off, fuckin',

518
00:32:15.399 --> 00:32:16.558
(clothing clatters) (laughs)

519
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.293
Anything you say can and
will be held against my body.

520
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.488
Your dick smuggling
days are over!

521
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.780
You will take these off and
you are going downtown,

522
00:32:25.782 --> 00:32:27.430
gimme, gimme 'em.

523
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.168
You know, if you
ask me, that's just rude.

524
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.948
I mean, we're all here,
having a good time, right,

525
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.598
having fun, and they
just get up and walk off.

526
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.603
Come on!

527
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:10.331
(door rattles)
(Mason whistles)

528
00:33:10.333 --> 00:33:12.648
I didn't think you got the hint.

529
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:13.900
Oh, I got it.

530
00:33:15.221 --> 00:33:16.709
You got it, huh?

531
00:33:16.711 --> 00:33:18.168
Yeah.

532
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:23.170
Wanna see it?
(rhythmic, sassy music)

533
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.961
[Mason] Oh fuck.

534
00:33:37.963 --> 00:33:41.296
(rhythmic, sassy music)

535
00:33:42.483 --> 00:33:46.121
Well uh, I guess it's just
you and me, kitten whiskers.

536
00:33:46.123 --> 00:33:48.338
(Miley chuckles quietly)

537
00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.703
No Charlie.

538
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:52.400
It's just you, boo.

539
00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:55.733
I'm crashing.

540
00:33:59.214 --> 00:34:01.998
(fire crackling)

541
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.953
I think I'm in love.

542
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.099
[Will] Playing hard
to get, that's fine.

543
00:34:05.101 --> 00:34:06.028
[Courtney] Yeah.

544
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.380
Get over here, criminals.

545
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.628
All right, so, woop, you
like these underwear,

546
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.380
you criminal,
that's right, you do.

547
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.663
Get out of here.

548
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.088
Here.

549
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.048
Here we are.
- Oh.

550
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.193
There we go.

551
00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:27.238
(Courtney breathing heavy)
(quiet, dramatic music)

552
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.073
There you go.

553
00:34:28.912 --> 00:34:29.830
Gotta like that,

554
00:34:29.832 --> 00:34:32.458
you're the best camp
counselor I've ever had.

555
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.840
Too bad I had to arrest you.

556
00:34:34.842 --> 00:34:37.939
(grunting) Ye haw, come on!

557
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:40.200
Oh now, mm mm, we
did cowboys last time.

558
00:34:40.202 --> 00:34:41.968
Okay, sorry sorry sorry.

559
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:45.053
(upbeat, rock music)

560
00:34:51.762 --> 00:34:56.762
(Tasha groaning)
(upbeat, rock music)

561
00:35:45.662 --> 00:35:47.391
(door clatters)

562
00:35:47.393 --> 00:35:50.476
(upbeat, rock music)

563
00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:00.628
So uh, I'm like super
tired, I mean it's like,

564
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.910
what time, like 2:00?

565
00:36:03.447 --> 00:36:04.280
10:30.

566
00:36:05.353 --> 00:36:06.633
(exhales) Really?

567
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:08.563
Shit.

568
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.033
Tell you what, man, in the
shed, underneath the mattress.

569
00:36:15.117 --> 00:36:15.950
Okay.

570
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.008
So, what are you doing here?

571
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.610
You know my story, what's yours?

572
00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.573
Not much of a story to tell.

573
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.678
Oh, I don't believe
that for a second.

574
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.993
What makes you say that?

575
00:36:35.277 --> 00:36:38.618
Well because Walter
told me a little bit about you.

576
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:43.620
Graduated St. Johns in a
DSNC with para-anesthesiology.

577
00:36:45.748 --> 00:36:46.831
Impressive.

578
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:48.948
Just because I'm a simple guy

579
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.078
doesn't mean I'm a stupid
one, Miss Hemsgrove.

580
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.327
Ah, I knew you'd
like this mullet ride.

581
00:36:55.329 --> 00:36:58.198
(Courtney mutters)
- Ah, I know,

582
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.068
that's what mullets do,
they're magical. (Grunts)

583
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.704
(Courtney giggles)
(Will grunting)

584
00:37:03.706 --> 00:37:05.344
All right, okay.

585
00:37:05.346 --> 00:37:08.508
All right, you criminal,
'bout ready to take you in.

586
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.918
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah.

587
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.370
Okay. (Grunts)

588
00:37:12.372 --> 00:37:15.493
Okay, oh okay. (Grunts)

589
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.333
(laughs) Oh, that's
mullet magic, baby.

590
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.253
Oh. (Exhaling)

591
00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:27.059
[Courtney] Shit.

592
00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:29.150
Did you like that?

593
00:37:29.152 --> 00:37:31.608
[Courtney] Yeah. (Mutters)

594
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.430
You gotta pee?

595
00:37:33.432 --> 00:37:34.598
Well don't do it here.

596
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.648
(Courtney laughs) (mutters)

597
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.178
Do you think I could
grow a mullet on my pubes?

598
00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:45.110
(zipper buzzes)
(quiet, dramatic music)

599
00:37:45.112 --> 00:37:50.112
(creature squishing)
(quiet, dramatic music)

600
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.157
(magazines clap)
(Charlie exhales)

601
00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:06.576
God fuckin' bless you, Gil.

602
00:38:08.218 --> 00:38:09.593
(laughs) Girl.

603
00:38:14.638 --> 00:38:16.547
(door clatters)

604
00:38:16.549 --> 00:38:21.549
(upbeat, rock music)
(Tasha groaning)

605
00:38:34.703 --> 00:38:38.618
(quiet, dramatic music)

606
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.620
(creature squishes)
(quiet, dramatic music)

607
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.568
So, why after all of that,

608
00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:57.023
would you be wasting
your skills as a nurse here?

609
00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.153
Seems like, to me, you're
running from something.

610
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:04.603
Or someone.

611
00:39:06.202 --> 00:39:09.285
(upbeat, rock music)

612
00:39:10.444 --> 00:39:12.202
(stool screeches)

613
00:39:12.204 --> 00:39:17.204
(upbeat, rock music)
(Tasha grunting)

614
00:39:17.499 --> 00:39:18.330
Let's just say,

615
00:39:18.332 --> 00:39:20.973
when you're in a
relationship with your boss,

616
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:26.568
it casts a dark shadow over
someone with a career like mine

617
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:31.570
and when said boss fails to
let you know that he's married,

618
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.013
yeah.

619
00:39:36.305 --> 00:39:38.488
Then you just move locations,

620
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.138
you don't take the
cheapest paying job,

621
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.016
watching a bunch of kids.

622
00:39:42.018 --> 00:39:44.744
(dramatic, suspenseful music)

623
00:39:44.746 --> 00:39:48.888
What the fuck
is that? (Shrieking)

624
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.728
Yeah, they seem a little
rough around the edges at times,

625
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.083
but they're really good kids.

626
00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:59.940
Well, to us, society's misfits.

627
00:39:59.942 --> 00:40:04.942
(bottles clink)
(Vanessa chuckles)

628
00:40:05.064 --> 00:40:08.231
(gentle, quiet music)

629
00:40:10.814 --> 00:40:15.814
(birds chirping)
(gentle, quiet music)

630
00:41:22.738 --> 00:41:25.821
(clomping footsteps)

631
00:41:28.042 --> 00:41:28.873
(door clatters)

632
00:41:28.875 --> 00:41:31.228
[Mason] Good
morning, sweet cheeks.

633
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.580
Now you're just teasing me.

634
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.148
Rough night?

635
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.053
Oh, I was just
being a lion tamer.

636
00:41:45.259 --> 00:41:48.103
(chair clatters)

637
00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:49.772
What's up her ass?

638
00:41:53.434 --> 00:41:55.362
Miss Hemsgrove.

639
00:41:55.364 --> 00:41:56.364
[Vanessa] Mr. Gil.

640
00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.750
Missing somebody?

641
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.748
You know, I've not seen
Will or Court this morning.

642
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.768
That's funny, I didn't hear
'em come in last night either.

643
00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:07.786
You apparently wouldn't
have heard shit after all this...

644
00:42:07.788 --> 00:42:08.688
(Charlie slams table)

645
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.878
Anyways, he didn't sneak
into your guy's bunk last night,

646
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.713
did he?

647
00:42:15.505 --> 00:42:18.058
(sighs) I told
them to stay close.

648
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.248
I'm sure they're fine.

649
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.318
I'll go look for
them in a minute.

650
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.653
I'm sure they just uh,
passed out after their walk.

651
00:42:24.949 --> 00:42:25.780
Anyone of you know how much

652
00:42:25.782 --> 00:42:27.323
a fully grown brown bear weighs?

653
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.953
About 500 pounds. (Sighs)

654
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.978
[Vanessa] Please
tell me you're joking.

655
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.488
Nope.

656
00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:39.858
But do I think
something happened?

657
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.968
Not really.

658
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.528
But it's something that needs
to be on all of your minds

659
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.880
if you decide to trek
out into the woods alone.

660
00:42:46.921 --> 00:42:49.288
Well uh, I'll make
sure to keep that in mind,

661
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.868
but do we, by chance have, like,

662
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:54.283
a rifle on site, or
something, just in case?

663
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.898
Forgot, ex-con.

664
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.628
Tell you what, Chuck,

665
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.488
why don't you use
your winning personality

666
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.718
if you run into wildlife?

667
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.270
It should be a solid deterrent.

668
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.159
By the way, you
smell like Mason's dick.

669
00:43:11.161 --> 00:43:14.245
Oh, better than smelling
like loneliness and depression.

670
00:43:14.247 --> 00:43:16.914
(women chuckle)

671
00:43:18.267 --> 00:43:22.892
(Vanessa mutters)
(door clatters)

672
00:43:22.894 --> 00:43:27.894
(woman screaming)
(chairs clatter)

673
00:43:29.304 --> 00:43:33.144
[Woman] Help me,
help me! (Screaming)

674
00:43:33.146 --> 00:43:34.071
Help me!

675
00:43:34.073 --> 00:43:36.028
- Hey, hey, whoa whoa whoa!
- Let go of me!

676
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.922
Easy, easy. (Woman screaming)

677
00:43:38.924 --> 00:43:42.424
(dramatic, ominous music)

678
00:43:44.604 --> 00:43:45.437
Yes!

679
00:43:46.672 --> 00:43:49.778
- Let me go!
- Chill! (Grunts)

680
00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.923
You don't understand,
it's out there!

681
00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:56.048
My friends, they're all...

682
00:43:58.113 --> 00:43:59.063
(Gil groaning)
- Jesus Gil,

683
00:43:59.065 --> 00:44:00.417
are you okay?

684
00:44:00.419 --> 00:44:02.053
- God.
- Come help me.

685
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.246
Get him up.

686
00:44:05.248 --> 00:44:07.831
(Gil grunting)

687
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.046
Somebody get her up and
let's get her to the med-bed.

688
00:44:12.048 --> 00:44:14.223
(groaning) Who
the fuck is this bitch?

689
00:44:14.225 --> 00:44:16.685
[Mason] You're taking
grandpa, I'll carry her.

690
00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:21.687
(gentle, dramatic
music) (birds chirping)

691
00:44:24.116 --> 00:44:26.664
(men grunt)

692
00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:31.316
[Gil] Jesus. (Grunts)

693
00:44:31.318 --> 00:44:34.651
(gentle, ominous music)

694
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:44.605
(lighter clicks) (gentle,
ominous music)

695
00:44:44.607 --> 00:44:45.440
Will!

696
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.553
Will, where are you?

697
00:45:00.479 --> 00:45:03.062
(Mason grunts)

698
00:45:06.249 --> 00:45:11.249
(labored breathing)
(quiet, ominous music)

699
00:45:13.107 --> 00:45:15.358
She's so bloody.

700
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.113
Laceration on her forehead,

701
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.733
laceration on left thigh.

702
00:45:21.934 --> 00:45:23.338
(Vanessa sighs)

703
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.628
You okay?

704
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.327
[Vanessa] Yeah, just
a little unexpected is all.

705
00:45:31.425 --> 00:45:33.188
Are you okay?

706
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:34.340
[Miley] I'll be fine.

707
00:45:35.604 --> 00:45:38.272
What the hell happened to her?

708
00:45:38.274 --> 00:45:41.607
(gentle, ominous music)

709
00:45:45.907 --> 00:45:46.824
Courtney!

710
00:45:48.464 --> 00:45:49.297
Will!

711
00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:55.063
Was that roast beef
an all-night buffet?

712
00:45:56.643 --> 00:46:00.608
(gentle, ominous music)

713
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:02.108
She's stable for now.

714
00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.708
Let's check back
on her in a few hours.

715
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.774
A few hours?

716
00:46:06.776 --> 00:46:07.718
What the fuck did
you hit her with?

717
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.903
[Vanessa] A sedative.

718
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.063
Okay, so what do we do now?

719
00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:16.518
[Gil] I think it's
time to make that call.

720
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.818
[Miley] Agreed.

721
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.920
Tash, can you go
and get the sat. Phone?

722
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.538
You two, I want everyone
back at this camp before sunset,

723
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.818
no more wandering around.

724
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.948
Go get Charlie, look
for Will and Courtney,

725
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:31.100
bring 'em back here
to the nurse's station.

726
00:46:33.376 --> 00:46:35.864
(Vanessa sighs)

727
00:46:35.866 --> 00:46:39.199
(gentle, ominous music)

728
00:46:46.096 --> 00:46:47.562
What the fuck?

729
00:46:47.564 --> 00:46:52.564
(rustling leaves)
(gentle, ominous music)

730
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.273
Jesus fucking Christ.

731
00:46:57.494 --> 00:47:00.875
(leaves rustling)

732
00:47:00.877 --> 00:47:03.544
(zipper buzzes)

733
00:47:06.117 --> 00:47:06.948
Oh shit.

734
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.550
I guess we're doing this.

735
00:47:11.916 --> 00:47:13.249
You all right?

736
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:18.073
I don't know, just
something's not right.

737
00:47:18.991 --> 00:47:21.648
Other than the obvious?

738
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.048
Maybe I'm being paranoid,
but (chuckles non-humorously)

739
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:27.008
She comes running
out of nowhere,

740
00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.728
damn near ferrel,

741
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:32.223
talking about something
being out in the woods. (Sighs)

742
00:47:34.302 --> 00:47:36.668
We're about 50 miles away
from the nearest civilization,

743
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.028
it's not really painting a...

744
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.553
Gil, you might wanna
come look at this.

745
00:47:42.382 --> 00:47:43.299
What now?

746
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.873
Clean up, you look like shit.

747
00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.021
I'll figure out what's going on.

748
00:47:51.023 --> 00:47:54.523
(quiet, foreboding music)

749
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.713
Oh shit. (quiet,
foreboding music)

750
00:48:08.444 --> 00:48:12.004
What the fuck?
(dramatic, menacing music)

751
00:48:12.006 --> 00:48:15.006
(Charlie screaming)

752
00:48:18.806 --> 00:48:23.806
(quiet, eerie music)
(insects singing)

753
00:48:33.984 --> 00:48:34.901
You okay?

754
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.843
Yeah, my ankle
still hurts a bit.

755
00:48:39.873 --> 00:48:41.062
Let me see.

756
00:48:41.064 --> 00:48:44.321
(gentle, quiet music)

757
00:48:44.323 --> 00:48:47.369
Oh yeah, definitely a sprain.

758
00:48:47.371 --> 00:48:50.068
(Miley grunts)

759
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:50.903
Sorry.

760
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.660
Um, you're fine.

761
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.188
You think you could get
my shoulders instead?

762
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:57.956
I just feel so tense.

763
00:48:57.958 --> 00:48:59.436
Yeah, sure.

764
00:48:59.438 --> 00:49:02.605
(gentle, quiet music)

765
00:49:06.998 --> 00:49:09.265
(Miley groans)

766
00:49:09.267 --> 00:49:11.434
You don't feel that tense.

767
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:14.958
Let me ask you something.

768
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.793
Go for it.

769
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.983
Why Tasha?

770
00:49:20.366 --> 00:49:21.197
What?

771
00:49:21.199 --> 00:49:23.513
You and Tasha, I don't get it.

772
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.808
Miles, it's not like we're...

773
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:30.198
There's nothing
special about her

774
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.633
and there's nothing that
she can do that I can't.

775
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.156
Or better.

776
00:49:35.158 --> 00:49:38.325
(gentle, quiet music)

777
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:46.010
Miles look, there's just
nothing here between you and I.

778
00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.718
I mean...

779
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.570
There could be.

780
00:49:50.707 --> 00:49:53.874
(gentle, quiet music)

781
00:49:54.735 --> 00:49:56.188
[Mason] (sighs) No, Miley,

782
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.618
we are in two different leagues.

783
00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:02.028
You need a good guy
and I am not a good guy.

784
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:03.973
Maybe I don't want a good guy.

785
00:50:03.975 --> 00:50:05.525
[Mason] And I don't want you.

786
00:50:06.805 --> 00:50:07.853
I'm sorry.

787
00:50:07.855 --> 00:50:10.643
Fine, have fun with your
cum guzzling gutter slut!

788
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.050
What did you do now?

789
00:50:17.485 --> 00:50:21.068
(gentle, foreboding music)

790
00:50:23.034 --> 00:50:28.034
(door clatters) (gentle,
foreboding music)

791
00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:35.066
(door rattles) (gentle,
foreboding music)

792
00:50:35.068 --> 00:50:40.068
(grass rustling) (gentle,
foreboding music)

793
00:50:47.923 --> 00:50:50.262
(shrieks) Where the fuck am I?

794
00:50:50.264 --> 00:50:51.858
- Stay down.
- Who the fuck are you?

795
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.801
[Vanessa] I'm Nurse
Vanessa Hemsgrove.

796
00:50:54.803 --> 00:50:57.440
You're at Pine Hills Camp.

797
00:50:57.442 --> 00:50:58.798
(fist thumps)
- Ow! (Grunts)

798
00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.928
Gil, give her some space.

799
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.300
[Gil] Bitch, would
you stop hitting me?

800
00:51:03.598 --> 00:51:04.429
[Woman] What
did you hit me with?

801
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:05.738
A sedative.

802
00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.668
The effects have
not worn off yet.

803
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:10.068
I promise, no one's
gonna hurt you.

804
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.948
[Mason] What happened?

805
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:14.278
[Gil] Bitch just went
in with a hair trigger.

806
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.908
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

807
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:18.008
[Vanessa] Can you
tell me your name?

808
00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:18.918
Jane.

809
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.751
[Gil] Oh, I swear to God,

810
00:51:19.753 --> 00:51:21.798
if you say your
last name is Doe...

811
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.408
Fuck off.

812
00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:25.263
[Vanessa] What are
you doing out here, Jane?

813
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.063
We were on vacation.

814
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.633
My friends and I were camping.

815
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:33.853
Something,

816
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.008
something attacked us.

817
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.275
There's something in the woods.

818
00:51:38.277 --> 00:51:39.377
Whoa whoa whoa, sit.

819
00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.473
What kind of something?

820
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:47.686
I don't know, some
animal, a monster.

821
00:51:47.688 --> 00:51:50.048
What the hell are you
talking about, what monster?

822
00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.998
It hunted us down.

823
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.833
It killed my friends.

824
00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:56.973
It killed,

825
00:52:00.077 --> 00:52:01.265
Alex.

826
00:52:01.267 --> 00:52:03.838
[Vanessa] I need to know
exactly what happened,

827
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.568
are there others out there?

828
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:08.268
They're dead, they're all dead.

829
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:11.758
[Vanessa] Gil, we've
gotta call somebody.

830
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.123
Where's the sat. Phone?

831
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.213
Smashed.

832
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.071
I don't know how...
- What?

833
00:52:18.073 --> 00:52:18.906
It's a no go.

834
00:52:19.865 --> 00:52:22.423
[Vanessa] Oh my God,
Will, Courtney, Charlie?

835
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.810
Nobody's come back yet.

836
00:52:27.317 --> 00:52:29.317
God, what is going on?

837
00:52:31.005 --> 00:52:32.922
[Gil] Hell if I know.

838
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.093
There are people missing.

839
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.888
She shows up, talking
about her friends

840
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.563
are being killed
by some monster?

841
00:52:42.546 --> 00:52:44.115
[Gil] I really don't think
she's the most reliable source

842
00:52:44.117 --> 00:52:45.817
of information
right now, Vanessa.

843
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.208
[Vanessa] Even so, I have
three counselors missing

844
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.808
and after what I've
seen the past few hours...

845
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.368
[Gil] What are you
talking about now?

846
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.387
Come look at this.

847
00:52:57.389 --> 00:53:00.889
(quiet, foreboding music)

848
00:53:06.769 --> 00:53:07.958
The fuck is that?

849
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.260
I don't know, but it
came out of Jane's leg.

850
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.113
She's sick, contagious?

851
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:15.283
I don't know.

852
00:53:17.429 --> 00:53:19.128
(Gil snaps fingers)

853
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.598
No bullshit, what
is that all over you?

854
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.723
Pick a friend.

855
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:26.023
Let's hear about
this monster of yours.

856
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:29.320
(Miley crying)

857
00:53:29.322 --> 00:53:30.648
(distant popping)

858
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:31.483
Tasha?

859
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:35.263
Just go away, okay?

860
00:53:37.676 --> 00:53:39.715
You were right, (crying)

861
00:53:39.717 --> 00:53:44.603
I'm not a gazelle, I'm just
a fucking elephant. (Crying)

862
00:53:47.269 --> 00:53:51.436
(ominous, foreboding
music) Tasha?

863
00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:01.580
(Miley screaming)
(dramatic, menacing music)

864
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:05.148
That's the last
thing I remember.

865
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.968
I woke up, heard some
not-too-friendly shit in the woods,

866
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.234
stumbled up on you
people, and here we are.

867
00:54:12.236 --> 00:54:16.103
(chuckles) No, I call
bullshit, it's gotta be bullshit.

868
00:54:17.316 --> 00:54:20.098
But you said you killed
the thing, though, right?

869
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.678
[Jane] As far as I know.

870
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.830
There wasn't much left.

871
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:24.933
Gil?

872
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:27.751
I'll start the car.

873
00:54:27.753 --> 00:54:30.093
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, what?

874
00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.998
You don't actually believe
this horseshit, do you?

875
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.888
Listen, Abercrombie, you
wanna hang around here,

876
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:35.778
be my guest.

877
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.611
What about the others,

878
00:54:36.613 --> 00:54:38.408
we're just gonna fuckin'
take off and leave 'em?

879
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:41.838
Mason's right, Gil, I'm not
leaving those kids out there.

880
00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.028
We gotta go find them.

881
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.438
So we go out there
and risk something

882
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.208
happening to all of us?

883
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.083
I am with Gil, I say we
hightail it the fuck outta here.

884
00:54:51.105 --> 00:54:52.338
And what if it was you?

885
00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.758
If I was stupid enough
to go out there alone,

886
00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.618
I'd expect you to spill
one for your homey

887
00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.083
and get the fuck outta dodge.

888
00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.901
Bitch.

889
00:54:59.903 --> 00:55:01.898
Hey, don't sit
there and act like

890
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:05.498
you'd be all heroic for me
if I was the one out there.

891
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.683
You can't go out there.

892
00:55:07.685 --> 00:55:10.608
If there are more of those
out there, believe me,

893
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:13.098
your friends are
more than likely dead.

894
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.325
Well, (sighs) I'm
not gonna sit here

895
00:55:15.327 --> 00:55:17.674
and listen to this
horseshit anymore.

896
00:55:17.676 --> 00:55:20.108
There are no goddamn
monsters out here

897
00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.128
and I'm not gonna bolt all
because some crack whore

898
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:23.938
decided she was
gonna run into camp

899
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.498
and tell us all
about her friends

900
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.725
that got killed by some Gil-man.

901
00:55:27.727 --> 00:55:29.458
(door clatters)

902
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.813
Actually, they
were ripped apart.

903
00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.013
Vanessa.

904
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.733
Gil, please.

905
00:55:39.894 --> 00:55:41.394
Goddamn it, all right, fine,

906
00:55:42.436 --> 00:55:44.078
Vanessa and I will
go look for the others,

907
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.278
you guys stay here in
case they come back.

908
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:49.358
Nice try, handsome,
but I'm not staying here.

909
00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.383
Didn't you just say it was
smarter not to go out there?

910
00:55:52.385 --> 00:55:54.028
(chuckles, unamused)
And I still stand by that.

911
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.678
However, I'd be more
comfortable with you out there

912
00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.673
than stuck here.

913
00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.888
[Vanessa] Where's Miley?

914
00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.118
Last I saw her, she was
headed towards the bathhouse.

915
00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.878
Can you please go get her?

916
00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.480
The last thing we need is
to be separated right now.

917
00:56:10.095 --> 00:56:11.628
I'm gonna go get
some more supplies

918
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:13.968
in case anybody else gets hurt.

919
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.528
I don't think a
bandaid's gonna cure

920
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:17.580
what's more than
likely happened to them.

921
00:56:18.735 --> 00:56:20.958
Our thoughts stay
positive, please.

922
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.793
Stay with her.

923
00:56:23.647 --> 00:56:26.647
I guess I'm gonna
get flashlights.

924
00:56:30.175 --> 00:56:32.842
(door clatters)

925
00:56:34.955 --> 00:56:37.538
(chair creaks)

926
00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:41.210
Sorry about the
whole crack whore jab.

927
00:56:53.078 --> 00:56:55.661
(door rattles)

928
00:56:57.698 --> 00:57:01.198
(quiet, foreboding music)

929
00:57:04.108 --> 00:57:07.426
(towel dispenser rumbling)

930
00:57:07.428 --> 00:57:12.428
(water hissing) (quiet,
foreboding music)

931
00:57:34.768 --> 00:57:39.768
(Jane crying) (quiet,
foreboding music)

932
00:57:58.365 --> 00:58:00.753
(zipper buzzes)

933
00:58:00.755 --> 00:58:03.422
(items rusting)

934
00:58:07.147 --> 00:58:11.773
(gasps) Jesus, Will, where
the hell have you guys been?

935
00:58:11.775 --> 00:58:15.124
(quiet, foreboding music)

936
00:58:15.126 --> 00:58:15.959
Will?

937
00:58:18.806 --> 00:58:19.639
Oh my God.

938
00:58:20.754 --> 00:58:24.337
(dramatic, menacing music)

939
00:58:27.463 --> 00:58:32.463
(Vanessa screaming)
(dramatic, menacing music)

940
00:58:35.783 --> 00:58:40.571
Oh no, please, no!
(dramatic, menacing music)

941
00:58:40.573 --> 00:58:45.573
(will growls)
(Vanessa screaming)

942
00:58:48.712 --> 00:58:51.276
Oh my God, oh my God.

943
00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:55.866
(Vanessa screams)
(Will grunting)

944
00:58:55.868 --> 00:58:59.451
(dramatic, menacing music)

945
00:59:00.415 --> 00:59:05.415
(Vanessa yells)
(dramatic, menacing music)

946
00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:11.476
(Vanessa screams)
(dramatic, menacing music)

947
00:59:12.236 --> 00:59:17.236
(men grunting) (dramatic,
menacing music)

948
00:59:20.241 --> 00:59:22.649
(gasps) Oh my God.

949
00:59:22.651 --> 00:59:25.568
(gasps) Holy shit.

950
00:59:26.642 --> 00:59:31.642
Oh my God, what is
happening? (Crying)

951
00:59:32.194 --> 00:59:36.971
Miley. (Door clatters)

952
00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:37.804
Miley?

953
00:59:37.806 --> 00:59:39.324
What the fuck!?

954
00:59:39.326 --> 00:59:40.793
Vanessa!

955
00:59:40.795 --> 00:59:44.372
(eerie, distorted music)

956
00:59:44.374 --> 00:59:45.205
(door clatters)

957
00:59:45.207 --> 00:59:47.558
Jesus fucking
Christ. (Grunts)

958
00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.608
[Gil] Yeah, he's dead.

959
00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:50.768
Oh no shit, I couldn't
tell from the scissors

960
00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:53.728
sticking out of his
fucking head. (Sighs)

961
00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:55.267
[Vanessa] Whatever
happened to Will

962
00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.188
has happened to
the others out there.

963
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.328
And what, exactly, is that?

964
01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.888
Eh, yeah we're
still working on it.

965
01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:07.890
It attaches itself to the host
and causes severe mutation.

966
01:00:08.011 --> 01:00:09.508
(sighs) Fuck.

967
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:13.023
However, without
the host being active,

968
01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:16.468
the parasite can't thrive.

969
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:18.028
And there's no
way to save the host?

970
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.748
With this severe of a
mutation, I don't think so.

971
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.790
So what happens to the parasite?

972
01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:27.792
(dramatic, menacing
music) (parasite screeching)

973
01:00:28.856 --> 01:00:32.750
(Tasha exhales)
(parasite squishing)

974
01:00:32.752 --> 01:00:33.820
(distant hissing)

975
01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:38.822
Whoa, they did not like that.

976
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.150
[Mason] Oh my God!

977
01:00:41.152 --> 01:00:44.569
(eerie, distorted music)

978
01:00:47.719 --> 01:00:49.136
Get the window!

979
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.790
Hey!

980
01:00:51.792 --> 01:00:53.849
(Mason grunts)
(hyperventilating)

981
01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.230
What the fuck's wrong with them?

982
01:00:55.232 --> 01:00:56.088
What was that?

983
01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:59.408
I don't know, and at
this point, I don't care.

984
01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:00.463
Just help me.

985
01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.073
[Vanessa] Gil,

986
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:08.389
this isn't normal.

987
01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:11.428
[Gil] I don't think that
constitutes as normal, tonight.

988
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:12.263
Look at this.

989
01:01:14.246 --> 01:01:15.738
[Gil] What am I looking for?

990
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.338
His heart, he
was still changing.

991
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.908
It's filled with puncture
wounds and holes.

992
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:24.188
Whatever that thing was

993
01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.563
was filling him full of
hormones and adrenaline.

994
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:30.054
That's what the fuck
that as throwing me around

995
01:01:30.056 --> 01:01:31.848
like a rag doll.

996
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:33.543
Yeah, but there's
more to it than that.

997
01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:36.068
What do you mean?

998
01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:38.297
Well think about
it for a second,

999
01:01:39.388 --> 01:01:40.858
(sighs) what's the heart do?

1000
01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.743
Pumps blood.

1001
01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.938
It was feeding oxygen
and blood into his body.

1002
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.123
- Okay.
- Well,

1003
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.198
what was that
thing gunning toward

1004
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.700
when it come out of his mouth?

1005
01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:54.893
[Gil] Tasha?

1006
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.403
What about me?

1007
01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:02.643
It also feeds blood into
certain areas of the body.

1008
01:02:03.977 --> 01:02:05.598
Oh.

1009
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.431
Okay.

1010
01:02:06.433 --> 01:02:08.653
Yeah, which is how it spreads,

1011
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:12.168
it takes over the entire
reproductive system,

1012
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:13.828
pumps an excessive
amount of adrenaline,

1013
01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.808
hormones into the body,

1014
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:16.710
overpowers it's prey
and infects them.

1015
01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:18.541
Ew.

1016
01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.118
So what you're saying
is this thing has a source,

1017
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.140
like a patient zero?

1018
01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:26.266
I don't know.

1019
01:02:26.268 --> 01:02:28.064
That's about all
I got at this point.

1020
01:02:28.066 --> 01:02:29.514
Shh.

1021
01:02:29.516 --> 01:02:30.349
Listen.

1022
01:02:32.668 --> 01:02:37.668
(engine humming)
(quiet, ominous music)

1023
01:02:51.677 --> 01:02:53.187
(door clatters)

1024
01:02:53.189 --> 01:02:58.189
(quiet, ominous
music) (insects singing)

1025
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:16.668
Bowman!

1026
01:03:17.686 --> 01:03:19.703
Fuck, I gotta go
get him. (Slaps wall)

1027
01:03:19.705 --> 01:03:21.564
You can't go out there.

1028
01:03:21.566 --> 01:03:23.463
Not gonna let him fuckin' die.

1029
01:03:23.465 --> 01:03:26.715
(quiet, ominous music)

1030
01:03:52.466 --> 01:03:55.464
(bag rustles)

1031
01:03:55.466 --> 01:03:57.363
(officer chuckles)

1032
01:03:57.365 --> 01:04:01.243
This outta put you
away for a couple years.

1033
01:04:01.245 --> 01:04:03.704
[Vanessa] Eh, just be safe.

1034
01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.704
Yeah, there's (mutters)

1035
01:04:05.706 --> 01:04:10.706
(door clattering)
(quiet, ominous music)

1036
01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:18.158
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1037
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.548
Get your hands up, Gil.

1038
01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:20.558
Bowman, calm down.

1039
01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.108
Get your hands up,
you fucking convict.

1040
01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.248
Bowman, you gotta
listen to me, man,

1041
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:28.318
calm down, there's some
fucked up shit happening tonight...

1042
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.423
I don't wanna hear it.

1043
01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:31.765
What the fuck are you doing?

1044
01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:32.858
You're fucking
planting evidence?

1045
01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.948
I don't wanna fucking hear it.

1046
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:36.205
I figure some asshole
like you got it coming,

1047
01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:37.195
you never fucking learn.

1048
01:04:37.197 --> 01:04:39.108
Now get your
fuckin' ass over here,

1049
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.508
put your hands on the table now.

1050
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:41.678
Don't have time for this...

1051
01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.218
[Officer] Put your goddamn
hands on the table, Gil!

1052
01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.998
- Shit has went down...
- Put your goddamn,

1053
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.746
fucking hands on the fucking
table, you son of a bitch.

1054
01:04:47.748 --> 01:04:50.213
(men arguing) (fist thumps)

1055
01:04:50.215 --> 01:04:51.671
(Gil grunts) Fuck huh?

1056
01:04:51.673 --> 01:04:53.578
Your fucking mouth, goddamn it.

1057
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.358
I've had enough
of your shit, Gil.

1058
01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.844
You're making a
fucking mistake, man...

1059
01:04:56.846 --> 01:04:57.748
Keep walking to

(officer muttering)

1065
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:13.938
Oh no, why is he taking him?

1066
01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.077
Uh, we have to go explain.

1067
01:05:19.077 --> 01:05:21.011
[Officer] How do you

You're going to jail, creep.

1082
01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:52.831
[Officer] What's

What are they doing?

1104
01:07:42.085 --> 01:07:42.916
Why did they stop?

1105
01:07:42.918 --> 01:07:44.264
I don't know.

1106
01:07:44.266 --> 01:07:45.099
Shit.

They were everywhere.

1109
01:07:53.225 --> 01:07:54.866
Five years in the pen,

1110
01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:57.198
the closest thing to
getting laid I'm gonna get

1111

1112
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.168
Hey, my offer still stands,

1113
01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:02.628
but if you get us
out of here alive,

1114

Come on.

1134
01:09:36.892 --> 01:09:38.059
[Jane] Fuck.

Yeah.

1138
01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:51.235
I think I, I told you something
was way fuckin' bad, still.

1139
01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.463
Duly noted. (Grunting)

(quiet, dramatic
music) (insects singing)

1141
01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.208
It's after Tash, we've
gotta go after it. (Grunts)

1142
01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:08.254
How do you even
know she's still alive?

1143

(distant screaming)

1144
01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:15.345
Call it a hunch. (Grunts)

1145
01:10:15.347 --> 01:10:18.347
Is there anything
useful in there?

1146

Yeah.

1149
01:10:30.587 --> 01:10:32.395
Vacation's over.

1150
01:10:32.397 --> 01:10:34.486
Time to get to work.

1151
01:10:34.488 --> 01:10:37.738
(quiet, ominous music)

1152
01:10:49.355 --> 01:10:53.633
Hey whoa whoa whoa.
(quiet, ominous music)

1153
01:10:53.635 --> 01:10:55.635

1164
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.120
Is anal still worth it?

1165
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:44.423
[Gil] Yeah.

1166
01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:46.433

[Jane] That's dynamite.

1173
01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:34.042

What's wrong with her?

1183
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:40.341
Who is that?

1184
01:13:40.343 --> 01:13:42.472
What's with the
bitch on the wall?

1185
01:13:42.474 --> 01:13:43.557
That's Meg.

1186
01:13:45.874 --> 01:13:50.761
And this is Alex. (Crying)

1187
01:13:50.763 --> 01:13:52.248

1238
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:10.838

slam into the door

1239
01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.489

(group laughing)

1241
01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:17.268

01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.668
[Man] Yeah, don't
run with scissors.

1243
01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:22.231

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.161
Who is that?

1251
01:22:41.163 --> 01:22:42.506
[Man] Is your dick out of place?

1252
01:22:42.508 --> 01:22:46.005

That was my line. (Laughs)

1255
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.823

and handy as you are,

1256
01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:56.538
I'm sure you know exactly
what to do with those hands.

1268
01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.721

1269
01:23:27.723 --> 01:23:31.682
[Mason] (laughs) Dude,

1270
01:23:31.684 --> 01:23:34.861

it, it's human nature.

1271
01:23:34.863 --> 01:23:39.863
(people muttering) (laughing)

1272
01:23:41.292 --> 01:23:42.329
I couldn't get it.

1273
01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:46.420
(group laughing) I'm trying.

1274
01:23:46.422 --> 01:23:50.790
(door thumps)
- Let me in!

1275
01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:53.375
(men laughing)

1276
01:23:55.611 --> 01:23:59.605
It flew right in
my eye. (Laughs)

1277
01:23:59.607 --> 01:24:02.418
Now Charlie, don't
be a sore loser, Charlie.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.253
Sorry Charlie.

1279
01:24:04.763 --> 01:24:05.596

1284
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:11.320
(birds chirping)

1285
01:26:25.557 --> 01:26:30.206
(door rattles) (squeaks)

1286
01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:32.958
(birds chirping)

1287
01:26:55.299 --> 01:26:58.799
(dramatic, booming music)

1288
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:02.513
