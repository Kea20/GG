00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.870
Hello.

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.150
Please look at this camera.

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.580
Okay.

9
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.230
Hello.

10
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.320
Hello.

11
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.580
Shall we start the interview?

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.980
Yes.

13
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.230
How do you feel

14
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.920
after being voted as the No. 1 Hottest Guy

15
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.120
in our magazine?

16
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.940
Thank you.

17
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.530
Actually, I don't usually

18
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.430
follow this kind of news,

19
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.060
but

20
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.830
I'm thankful.

21
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.440
Normally, our No. 1 title holders

22
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.280
are always bachelors.

23
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.510
You are the first exception, Dr. Anirut.

24
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.520
Oh! Then,

25
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.540
you probably need to make sure that they

26
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.650
didn't vote for the wrong man.

27
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.060
How could it be possible?

28
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.400
You're such a perfect man.

29
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.670
You're the one.

30
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.990
You are married.

31
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.290
And you also have a perfect family.

32
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.310
I have to give my wife credit for that.

33
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.470
She makes my life

34
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.300
so perfect like this.

35
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.840
How does she do that?

36
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.260
If I tell you, you might think

37
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.910
that I'm bragging about my wife.

38
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.680
But,

39
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.280
it's true.

40
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.370
My wife, she is

41
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.990
so perfect.

42
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.690
She is beautiful,

43
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.680
and smart,

44
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.390
and she is such a nice person.

45
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.940
So, my married life turned out to be

46
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.000
so much better than I expected.

47
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.140
You cherish your wife so much.

48
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.170
After hearing that, many girls,

49
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
must feel envious of her.

50
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.440
I've been looking for you.

51
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.820
Oh my!

52
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800
I was thinking
where all the maids were.

53
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.240
So, you are trying to act like a madam.

54
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.030
That's not true.

55
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.270
How could that be not true?

56
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.290
I saw you're just rolling on the bed.

57
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.940
I just...
I came here to clean the bedroom.

58
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.050
Do you think I'm dumb?

59
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.130
I am wondering

60
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090
if Anirut finds out about this,

61
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.790
what is he going to say?

62
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.360
You should start looking for a new job.

63
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.720
What about you?

64
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.750
What are you doing
in my master's bedroom?

65
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.190
What a guest!

66
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.280
Entering the house owner's bedroom
without permission. Huh?

67
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.300
Who knows?

68
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.800
Maybe the house owner would want me

69
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
to be another owner of this house.

70
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.590
Just get used to paying respect to me now.

71
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.960
So that when I really become
the owner of this house,

72
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.730
you might not get fired.

73
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.870
Well,

74
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.780
I really want Madam

75
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.770
to hear what you just said.

76
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.620
To see your true colors.

77
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.810
Then she'll know

78
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.190
that you want to snatch her husband.

79
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.400
And if my master also sees it,

80
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.810
that would be great.

81
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.920
What do you think,

82
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.360
Ma'am?

83
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.780
Ha!

84
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.530
You should mind your own business.

85
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.030
Because a maid like you

86
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.140
is brainless

87
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.150
to forget that you're just a maid,

88
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.100
and look down on me.

89
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.140
It should be you to get kicked out.

90
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.770
No one believes a maid like you.

91
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.880
Oh yeah?

92
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.270
What a fine lady!

93
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.860
Let's see,

94
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.780
if my evidence

95
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.940
is not enough to expose a witch like you.

96
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.660
Give it to me.

97
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.380
Why?

98
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.950
Huh?

99
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.250
Boo! Serves you right!

100
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.470
Ah!

101
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.510
You witch!

102
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.480
You witch!

103
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.920
Why?

104
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.450
Madam must know this.

105
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.740
Ah! Let me go!

106
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.120
Ah! Let me go!

107
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.990
Ah! Let me go!

108
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.050
Let you go?

109
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.190
Argh! Ouch!

110
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.450
Where are you going?

111
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.240
Give me back my phone!

112
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.750
Give it to me!

113
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.730
Ouch!

114
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.280
Where are you going?

115
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.830
Ouch!

116
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.550
Argh! Ouch! Let me go!

117
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.130
You should know your place.

118
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.540
You're just a servant!

119
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.330
Argh!

120
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.150
Give me back my phone!

121
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.740
You witch!

122
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.350
Hi, Vi.

123
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.340
You came back early today.

124
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.350
And you, Orn?
What are you doing here?

125
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.760
Rut hasn't come back home yet.

126
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.660
I missed you, Vi.

127
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.670
We haven't had a meal together for a while.

128
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.690
I came here because
I want to have a meal with you.

129
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.420
I'll ask Nuan

130
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.770
to tell the cook
to prepare everything

131
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.250
because we have a guest today.

132
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.000
Vi.

133
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.430
May I ask you something?

134
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.090
What is it?

135
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.650
About Nuan, your maid.

136
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.670
What about her?

137
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.210
I saw she sneakily put on your clothes,

138
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.830
lied on your bed,

139
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.850
and acted like she was you.

140
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.540
When I arrived here,

141
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.510
I kept calling her to open the door for me.

142
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.040
But she didn't come to open the door.

143
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.570
I had to walk in by myself.

144
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.010
As soon as I walked in,

145
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.040
I saw what she was doing.

146
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.650
I tried to remind her politely
not to do this.

147
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.510
But she said I'm just an outsider.

148
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.300
Vi.

149
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.480
She is

150
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.820
with no manners

151
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.470
and so discourteous.

152
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.320
It will be a problem
if you keep hiring her.

153
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.650
Is that so?

154
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.790
I was so angry.

155
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.710
Seeing what she did,

156
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.400
I can't imagine
what she does behind your back.

157
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.370
A person who acts nicely in front of you,

158
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.870
but does bad things behind your back.

159
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.030
We've seen many people like that.

160
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.280
Some may come to you as a maid.

161
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.590
Some may come as noble people.

162
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.320
Saying all sweet things
but meaning evil deeds.

163
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.370
I don't want to take those silly things
to my heart, Orn.

164
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.130
Vi.

165
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.080
Are you not in a good mood today?

166
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.840
You must have had a bad day at work.

167
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.670
How about this?

168
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.270
If you don't want to be bothered by this problem,

169
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.530
I'll help find a new maid for you.

170
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.580
How about that?

171
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.920
Thank you so much.

172
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.440
But this is all about my house.

173
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.050
If I want to change,

174
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.170
I don't have to bother anyone else.

175
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.130
Who's anyone, Vi?

176
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.720
I've been close to both Anirut and you.

177
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.610
Your house is like my own house.

178
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.250
If there's anything I can help with,

179
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.400
I would love to do it.

180
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.000
Thank you so much.

181
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.640
But everything about my house

182
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.890
is the responsibility of the wife like me.

183
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.690
That's what I need to do.

184
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.410
You don't have to be so worried.

185
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.850
If you say so.

186
00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.470
Vi.

187
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.310
If you have anything
you want me to help with,

188
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.600
you can always tell me.

189
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.620
I'd love to help.

190
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:12.930
Vi.

191
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.770
Rut.

192
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.790
You've finally come back, Rut.

193
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.530
I've been waiting for you.

194
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.730
Oh. Did I do something offending to you, Vi?

195
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.920
Just don't take it personally.

196
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.950
It became my habit since I'd been abroad.

197
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.660
That's alright.

198
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.960
I understand

199
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.260
that different kinds of manners

200
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.280
have been taught to us.

201
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.550
That's not a big deal, Orn.

202
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.110
Vi doesn't worry about minor things.

203
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.250
You're always nice, Vi.

204
00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.950
I have no doubts about why

205
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.680
Rut loves you so much.

206
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.980
Rut.

207
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.440
May I join the dinner with you today?

208
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.170
I already asked Vi, and she's okay with it.

209
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.610
That would be nice.

210
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.630
The house looks lively when you're here.

211
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.990
Enjoy your time, then.

212
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.570
I want to take some rest.

213
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.710
Oh!

214
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.820
Aren't you going to hang around with us?

215
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.010
Take your time.

216
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.210
Rut.

217
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.870
I have something to talk with you.

218
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600
It's about Nuan, your maid.

219
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.290
(Men always think that)

220
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.690
(when a woman holds the status of)

221
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.340
(a wife,)

222
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.700
(she needs to accept everything)

223
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.490
(that her husband does.)

224
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.700
(That's not true.)

225
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.940
Argh!

226
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.750
Where are you going?

227
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.860
Where are you going?

228
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.890
Give me back my phone.

229
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.830
Give it back!

230
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.910
(A woman like Dr. Vikanda)

231
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.620
(who endures it)

232
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.730
(might not be for love.)

233
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.760
(Still, she waits for the day
to walk away with her worth.)

234
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.170
(And she'll leave a valuable lesson for her husband,)

235
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.380
(who deserves her dignity as)

236
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.520
(the wife.)

237
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:56.940
=The Wife=

238
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.030
Rut.

239
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.690
Vi.

240
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.610
This is Nuan.

241
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.440
Our new maid.

242
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.280
Hello, sir.

243
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.640
My name is Nuan.

244
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.530
I would like to hire a maid

245
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.480
from a cleaning company.

246
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.670
What do you think?

247
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.070
What for?

248
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.900
We already have our maids.

249
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.960
And,

250
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.180
we have Nuan.

251
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.670
But she just works in the place
of the former maid.

252
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.020
It's temporary.

253
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.450
We didn't mean to hire her permanently.

254
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.810
But I think we can count on her.

255
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.500
She works neatly.

256
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.780
Why do you need to hire
someone from the company?

257
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.310
I've seen many people have problems with that.

258
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.680
Also,

259
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.800
I don't like to have strangers

260
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.400
walking in and out of our house.

261
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.090
So, you like someone you're familiar with.

262
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.340
I want a divorce, Mom.

263
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.530
You've just got married for a few months.

264
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.350
I can't live with a man
who sleeps around with any girls.

265
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.690
I can't.

266
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.150
From a waitress to a maid,

267
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.170
I don't know who else it's going to be.

268
00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.690
I can't stand it anymore.

269
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.400
I want to divorce him, Mom.

270
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.690
Vi, Vi.

271
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.130
Calm down, dear.

272
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.250
Calm down.

273
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.530
Listen to me.

274
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.250
About the divorce,

275
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.860
for other people, it's easy.

276
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.250
But for you,

277
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.240
it's not easy, you know?

278
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.960
How would it be difficult?

279
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.470
Just sign the paper.

280
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.180
I don't see it as difficult at all.

281
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.200
What about your reputation?

282
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.920
You are Dr. Vikanda.

283
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.270
A daughter of Dr. Phakphoom

284
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.290
and Dr. Supansa.

285
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.970
Your father

286
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.880
is the owner of a famous university.

287
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.130
And you are the assistant director
of the ministry where millions of people

288
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.960
took the exam for this position.

289
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.820
More importantly,

290
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.590
you are the woman that Rut

291
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.080
praises and lets everyone know

292
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.100
that you're his wife.

293
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.170
But he keeps cheating on me all the time, Mom.

294
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.050
No matter what you saw or heard,

295
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.870
you have to stand tall on the top of the mountain.

296
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.420
And you shall make Rut see

297
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.070
that his wife

298
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:17.020
is far superior and more graceful
than any other women.

299
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.780
If he realizes that, he'll stop.

300
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.690
(If he realizes that, he'll stop.)

301
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.210
What are you doing?

302
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.400
Figuring out the ways to handle

303
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.420
people who cause trouble in our house, I guess.

304
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.790
Oh, sweetheart.

305
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.770
Orn is just a lonely girl.

306
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.790
Don't take it too personally.

307
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.830
What if I feel lonely,

308
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.150
and keep asking to have dinner
with all the people around?

309
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.040
You would be okay with that, right?

310
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.800
But she didn't do anything bad.

311
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.830
Also,

312
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.620
she is nice to you too, isn't she?

313
00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.520
Ha!

314
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.800
Many people are nice to me.

315
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.870
But not all of them

316
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.530
are nice from their heart.

317
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.720
Some act nicely
because they want something else.

318
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.740
My love.

319
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.910
I think

320
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.090
you're overthinking.

321
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.740
Whenever I overthink,

322
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.840
it actually happens, doesn't it?

323
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.790
I always see you do what I think.

324
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.380
It truly happens every time.

325
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.270
What is this all about?

326
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.340
These days,

327
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.620
do we have to fight

328
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.730
over what hasn't happened yet?

329
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.230
Do you dare to promise me

330
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.840
that it won't happen?

331
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.150
Huh!

332
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.760
I guess our married life

333
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.220
is way too peaceful, right?

334
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.110
That's why you keep picking on me like this, huh?

335
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.640
Do you think I want to be like this?

336
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.660
I want to stop it too.

337
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.680
I just want to be happy.

338
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.510
Vi.

339
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.610
How are you not happy?

340
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.930
You see

341
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.790
that I

342
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.750
respect you so much.

343
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.880
Not any other women get what you have right now.

344
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.960
I married you

345
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.150
because I want to be the only woman of yours.

346
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.450
You're the only one in my eyes.

347
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.240
I've never praised any women like you.

348
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.700
I've been too tired.

349
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.790
I want to be alone.

350
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.630
I think

351
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.300
you should relax and let go.

352
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.610
Any minor things
aren't worth your attention.

353
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.820
You just don't take it to your heart.

354
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.550
And your life

355
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.530
will get happier.

356
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.350
Come down and have dinner together, okay?

357
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.890
I don't want anybody to see us
as disrespectful people.

358
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.790
(Orn-in: I'm so happy.)

359
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.940
Madam. Madam.

360
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.060
What's wrong?

361
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.410
Tell me.

362
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.090
Please don't kick me out.

363
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.110
I don't have anywhere to go.

364
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.920
Please.

365
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.380
Why do you care about it?

366
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.410
What you've done to me

367
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.430
is much more than what you just did.

368
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.520
Madam,

369
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.450
please don't kick me out.

370
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.380
Please, Madam.

371
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.590
You can't fight with that woman

372
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.020
all alone by yourself.

373
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.540
It's true that I've done bad things to you.

374
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.250
But I've never ever

375
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.450
had any thoughts to hurt you.

376
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.070
But that chick is different.

377
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.550
She'll do everything

378
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.580
to take your place.

379
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.480
You need to have me to help you fight with her.

380
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.090
Please.

381
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.110
Madam.

382
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.270
Rut said this is your favorite.

383
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.160
Eat up.

384
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.940
Rut.

385
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.540
Drink this hot soup so you'll feel more relaxed.

386
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.510
Thank you.

387
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.570
Um, should we try changing the mood

388
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.410
by eating out and listening to music sometimes?

389
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.630
I think that's a nice idea.

390
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.640
What do you think, Vi?

391
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.680
I know a nice place.

392
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.390
Let's go together, Vi.

393
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.340
Well,

394
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.580
Vi doesn't like eating out.

395
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.670
She always says that she's tired from work.

396
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.600
She'd rather take a rest.

397
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.440
Oh, dear!

398
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.020
Just try changing the mood.

399
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.240
Locking yourself in the house

400
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.450
is too boring.

401
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.820
Anyway,

402
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.780
if you don't want to go,

403
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.930
may I ask Rut to go with me?

404
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.210
I think...

405
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.100
You can do as you please.

406
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.950
Lately, you've walked in and out
without asking me anyway.

407
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.300
Why do you have to be bothered to ask now?

408
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.760
Then, that's great.

409
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.360
From now on,

410
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.210
I think I don't have to ask you.

411
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.600
