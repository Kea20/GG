1
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:04,961
Let the tale seduce you,

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,398
just as I was seduced.

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:08,747
Ah!

4
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,271
You like to watch?

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,231
Of course.

6
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:15,406
We were equals.

7
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,408
And then, Claudia.

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:18,801
No! Don't!

9
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,455
Aah!

10
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,674
Embrace what you are!

11
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,154
You are a killer, Louis!

12
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:58,074
They don't like it
when her shot is late.

13
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,815
No, I understand.

14
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,338
But because I'm new

15
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,254
and taking over for Dr. Stevens,

16
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:07,605
it's just hard to believe
this is my patient.

17
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,346
I mean, the file is so thick,
I assumed she was elderly.

18
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,305
She's 47.

19
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:12,654
she is your patient,

20
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:15,918
and she needs
her Thorazine shot now.

21
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:25,188
Before I give her her shot,

22
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,973
I really should review her file.

23
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,164
Where did he go,

24
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:29,600
the... the man

25
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,341
that was just talking to her?

26
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:33,691
What man?

27
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,872
I need a moment alone
with my patient...

28
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,222
please.

29
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,677
What happened to you?

30
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,031
I can taste
those martinis from here.

31
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:55,295
I'm trying a new gin from Japan.

32
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,731
Oh.

33
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,953
I was telling
the Uber man about you.

34
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,607
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,436
And he said,
if she's such a fancy doctor,

36
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,917
why does she live on a boat
like a dropout?

37
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,920
Did you tell him,
so I can travel the globe,

38
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,574
searching for home?

39
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:15,967
I'm your home.

40
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,142
I know.

41
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,405
Hi.

42
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:21,103
Happy adoption day,
my sweet girl.

43
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,979
So, Joey,
you're gonna go to sleep.

44
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,199
When you wake up, you'll
already be feeling better.

45
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:35,378
Is it really bad, what I have?

46
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,380
All the grown-ups
are freaking out.

47
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,427
I'm a grown-up

48
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:41,950
and a doctor and your surgeon.

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,430
Am I freaking out?

50
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,605
Is Maya freaking out?

51
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,607
I'm definitely not freaking out.

52
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,217
You know why?

53
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,610
Dr. Fielding's made me
believe in magic.

54
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,046
She's that good.

55
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,049
I have very good instincts.

56
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,007
And right now,
my instincts are telling me

57
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:57,487
that you're gonna be just fine.

58
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,064
I'm taking this one.

59
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,413
You'll assist.

60
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,328
What? He's my patient.

61
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,069
That's why you're assisting.

62
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,854
The board decided to sit in
on a procedure today.

63
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,769
They're interested in pediatrics

64
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,206
and, of course, seeing their
chief of surgery in action.

65
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:24,253
OK, except that
I'm worried that position

66
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,776
will worsen his bleed.

67
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,430
I suspect his AVM
is above the ventricle.

68
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,997
You suspect?

69
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,781
I know you don't know.

70
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,435
His bleed was so sudden, we
didn't have time to image him.

71
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,263
Dr. Keck, I'm just remembering

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,221
that AVM of yours last month,

73
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:40,051
how you put the patient prone,
used a far lateral approach.

74
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,357
That was smart.
- Is this really the time

75
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,663
to be arguing, Dr. Fielding?

76
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,708
I feel strongly
that this is the wrong way in.

77
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,754
I'm concerned
if we don't flip him

78
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:47,929
that he could have another...

79
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,452
- Oh, shit.
He's got another bleed.

80
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,062
- OK.
- Get him on his side now.

81
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,891
Towards you. 1. 2. 3.

82
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:54,892
Oh, my God.

83
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,546
I told you Keck was a menace.

84
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,200
If you hadn't been there...
- Shh!

85
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,942
Keep your voice down.

86
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:04,902
I was there, and that boy's
gonna be OK, so...

87
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,296
So he operates on adults
all day, not children.

88
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,776
So he should have been
following your lead

89
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,952
instead of making you
tiptoe around him,

90
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,867
trying not to puncture
his precious ego.

91
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,391
If I'd openly made him
look like an ass,

92
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,175
it would have been much worse.

93
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:18,916
And that's a win?

94
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,179
How can you be so calm
every time he does this to you?

95
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,835
Because getting angry
won't help my patients.

96
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,402
Yeah, but it might help you.

97
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,708
Yeah, or get me fired.

98
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,624
No way. If you go, I go.

99
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,756
- Listen.
Someday I'll have Keck's job.

100
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,323
And when I do
and you have my job,

101
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,151
you will never have to do
what I just did.

102
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,719
You'll be able to say
what you need to say

103
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,070
and be who you are,
and it'll be a new day.

104
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,420
And remember,

105
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,162
the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

106
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,598
- Wait.
What does that even mean?

107
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,427
I don't know.

108
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:54,082
Some guy said it to me in a bar.

109
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,524
Mom.

110
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:04,179
Hi. What are you doing here?

111
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:08,357
I was downstairs for my scan.

112
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,621
And?

113
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:16,974
It's back.

114
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,500
No.

115
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:28,420
Yes.

116
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:33,600
I checked on our patient,
and, um,

117
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,036
his vitals are steady,

118
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,821
and he's already asking
to play "Minecraft."

119
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,997
I hope you told him
no video games.

120
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,217
That's a great idea.

121
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,784
I-I... I'll...
I'll remind him of that.

122
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,484
It occurred to me
that Daniel Lemle

123
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,573
was in the gallery today,
observing us.

124
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,053
Right.

125
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,795
I've been keeping tabs
on his company Revenia

126
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:57,624
and the stem cell work
that they're doing,

127
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,756
their trials
with cancer patients.

128
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,584
- Good for you.
Now, I really do need...

129
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:04,152
Dr. Keck, I-I... um, I have...

130
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,546
I have to ask you for a favor.

131
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,728
My mother has relapsed,

132
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:17,382
and I just saw her scan,
and it's not good.

133
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,950
But Revenia is looking
for a research associate.

134
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:22,605
It's part-time, and it wouldn't
affect my schedule here.

135
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:25,434
So I'd like to apply
for the job.

136
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,828
I-I mean, the, um...

137
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:32,876
The stem cell trial
is currently full, but...

138
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,704
maybe we could
squeeze my mother in

139
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,619
if I was already there working.

140
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,668
So you know Daniel Lemle.

141
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:45,585
I thought maybe you could
put in a good word for me.

142
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,371
What word would you have me use?

143
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:54,724
"Hardworking,"

144
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:57,292
"impressive," maybe,
whatever you think.

145
00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:00,077
I think Daniel Lemle is one
of our most important donors.

146
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:04,081
And I'm not sure
I could recommend

147
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,822
a doctor who would be
applying for his position

148
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,781
for personal reasons.

149
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,522
I would never let
the situation with my mom

150
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,698
get in the way of my work.

151
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,221
I think you know me well enough

152
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,571
to know that I'm
a consummate professional.

153
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:17,704
Oh, well, let me
ask you something.

154
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,140
When that boy wanted
to play "Minecraft,"

155
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,751
you told him right then,
no video games?

156
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,799
I... may have mentioned.

157
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,497
And yet just now, you made it
seem like you hadn't,

158
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,500
like it was my idea.

159
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,981
I'm gonna be honest with you.

160
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,332
You really can't hide your...
What would you call it...

161
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,248
Arrogance, sense of superiority?

162
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:41,902
You do try.

163
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,339
You make a good show
of being deferential.

164
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:47,559
But underneath, you're always
very sure that you're right,

165
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,692
like today
in the operating theater.

166
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,476
- I was right.
- You were lucky.

167
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,957
You're not ready
to take the reins.

168
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,480
I know that's hard to hear,

169
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,308
but I say that
for a number of reasons.

170
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,920
You have to be able
to lead everybody,

171
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,053
not just your female surgeons
and mentees.

172
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,539
Ow.

173
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,498
What? What's the matter?

174
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:14,586
Oh!

175
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:16,676
Dr. Keck!

176
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,849
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

177
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,374
Mm, I took the Lord's name
in vain four times...

178
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,116
Well... A lot of times.

179
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,857
I gave Sister Sarah the finger

180
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,468
when her back was turned...
Again.

181
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,774
What about the man?

182
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,473
I hardly ever see him anymore.

183
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,214
Deirdre...

184
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,216
lying is also a sin.

185
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,828
I guess he has
always been around,

186
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,655
even since before
my mother died,

187
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,570
which makes him like family,

188
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,007
only way better,

189
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,965
because you know how crazy
my aunts are.

190
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,535
So... I'm grateful to him.

191
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,841
Even when I was little,

192
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,973
he always knew
what I was feeling.

193
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,150
He actually cared about me.

194
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,762
But now that I'm older,
I don't need him anymore.

195
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,155
I hope that's true.

196
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,940
Ten Our Fathers,
three Hail Marys,

197
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,898
one Act of Contrition...

198
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,291
Not that you'll do any of them.

199
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,339
Stop it.

200
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,428
Stop it now.

201
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,518
Girls, to steal flowers
off the altar

202
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,998
is a cardinal sin.

203
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:03,391
We didn't steal them.

204
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,828
They just blew into our arms.

205
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,699
Girls, stop it.

206
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,099
I was just talking about you
to Father Duffy.

207
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,798
Don't believe a word
he says about me.

208
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,626
Deirdre!

209
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,895
They're all in your hair.

210
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,810
Deirdre!

211
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,522
Oh, she doesn't listen.
She doesn't.

212
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,002
You never listen.

213
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,787
How many times have I told you

214
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,268
not to encourage him?

215
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:58,359
Thousands, and yet
you refuse to obey me.

216
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,404
I didn't ask him to come.

217
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:04,495
Why can't you see that I am
trying to protect you?

218
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,325
Just go to your room

219
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,850
and think
about what you've done.

220
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,993
We'll go there someday.

221
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,473
You've been saying that
since I was ten years old,

222
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:26,909
and here I am.

223
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,259
Mm.

224
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,608
She locked you up because of me,

225
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,262
and now you're angry.

226
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,611
She treats me like a child...

227
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,700
That's no surprise...
But so do you.

228
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,354
Because you are a child.

229
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:38,965
No, I'm not.

230
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,532
You're behaving like one,

231
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,578
pouting in your room,

232
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,710
throwing a temper tantrum.

233
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:48,583
Because I don't want
to play your games anymore.

234
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:52,369
You know how I feel about you...

235
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,154
and you know what I want
from you.

236
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:58,158
We both know it's impossible.

237
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,905
When your mother was your age,

238
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,820
on a night like this,

239
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,170
she'd pull out the dress
she had hidden

240
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,868
in the back of the closet,

241
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:16,002
disappear down the trellis
to a party.

242
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,747
There's always a party
at your uncle Cortland's.

243
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,014
But that makes no sense.

244
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,537
I know it doesn't make sense,

245
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,931
but suddenly...

246
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:36,109
I was picturing Keck's brain,

247
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,548
like, I mean, his actual artery

248
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:41,810
pumping blood.

249
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,291
And... and then he collapsed.

250
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:51,689
I'm sorry that Dr. Keck
is in the hospital,

251
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,257
but I don't see what that
has to do with you.

252
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,259
Because you're not
listening to me.

253
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,697
What, the sci-fi part
of the story?

254
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,091
You didn't see inside his brain

255
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:05,138
or shoot rays from your head
into his head.

256
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,617
I didn't say rays.

257
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,098
Mom, please, listen, Mom.

258
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,234
Remember Lucy Stone
from second grade?

259
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,801
They said
that she'd had a seizure.

260
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:21,371
But what I remember
is seeing inside her head,

261
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,199
and then she collapsed.

262
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,290
Are you serious?

263
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,902
If I read his medical report
and it says that he ruptured

264
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,470
his left internal
carotid artery,

265
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,603
which is what I saw when I was...

266
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,779
I saw... but...

267
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,694
maybe I didn't see it.

268
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:43,872
Maybe it was just some
neurological event,

269
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,962
or it's some genetic condition.

270
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,618
But, then, I'd need to know
my genetics to diagnose that.

271
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:52,185
And I don't know my genetics.
- Please.

272
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,534
- Do I?
- Please, not this.

273
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:54,709
But if I knew
who my parents were,

274
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:55,840
then I would know
what I came from,

275
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,842
and I would know who I am.

276
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:00,497
And then maybe I would
understand what happened.

277
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:04,110
You know how hard I have tried

278
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,330
to find your birth parents.

279
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:11,421
There is nothing we can do
about a closed adoption.

280
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:14,990
The agency will not
open the records.

281
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,210
I-I'm sorry.

282
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,428
I'm here to comfort you.

283
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,083
Huh.

284
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,303
You're doing a wonderful job.

285
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,090
You know what I would like
right now?

286
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,135
Hmm.

287
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,267
Is a strawberry milkshake

288
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,356
from In-N-Out out on Jefferson.

289
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,184
And I've got some money
in my purse.

290
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:37,969
I have a job, Mom.

291
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,493
I can get you a milkshake.

292
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,584
Can you hand me my purse anyway?

293
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:44,976
Yeah.

294
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,112
Thanks.

295
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,767
Thank you
for being with me today.

296
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,900
I'll be back.

297
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,356
This is the New Orleans office.

298
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,620
I need to speak to the person

299
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,362
who is assigned
to my daughter's file.

300
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,799
I'm sorry.
I don't have his name.

301
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:25,974
Who's calling?

302
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,367
Elena Fielding.

303
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:28,716
My daughter is Rowan.

304
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:31,110
Fielding, OK.

305
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,503
Let me check if there's an agent

306
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,983
assigned to your file.

307
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,941
Hold for a moment.

308
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,663
There is an agent,

309
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:03,838
but he's not here right now.

310
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,188
I can get him a message.

311
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,236
Please tell him
that my daughter...

312
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,456
That she thinks that she has
harmed someone with her mind.

313
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,632
Did she harm someone
with her mind?

314
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,330
I think she might have.

315
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,071
So what I need is for this agent

316
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:24,032
to go and see
if something is different...

317
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,642
In New Orleans, I mean.

318
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:29,211
I need to know
if something has changed.

319
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:39,830
Hey.

320
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,225
Sapporo? Shot of Tito's?

321
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,705
Both.

322
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,707
Bad day?

323
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,230
Hard to describe.

324
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,450
When's your shift over?

325
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,755
Sorry, Ro, not tonight.

326
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,801
I've got a date.

327
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,194
Yeah, with me.

328
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:58,109
No.

329
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,199
With someone who won't
kick me out before breakfast.

330
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,332
I'm not a breakfast person.

331

00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:17,303

For you, on me.

338
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,017
The kindness of strangers.

339
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,975
Can I get you anything?

340
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:39,499
Yeah, you can
get me out of here.

341
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:42,632
OK.

342
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,548

that clown back there.

348
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,752
Why, Ro?

349
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,801
For months, I've been watching
you from behind the bar,

350
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,543
this revolving door of guys.

351
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,501
It's got to be so lonely.

352
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:28,330
Why are you watching me?

353
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,072
We're friends.

354
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,468
I like you.

355
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,515
Well, for one,
I bring guys like that home

356
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:42,257
because they don't
lie next to me

357
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,433
and hound me with questions.

358
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:49,612
Is it an only-child thing?

359
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,092
Why don't we try
head-shrinking you

360
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,355
for a minute?

361
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:56,140
What exactly is it
you're looking for,

362
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,272
your one true love?

363
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:58,186
Fuck you.

364
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,971
No, I-I think it's sweet.

365
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,625
I actually... when I was a kid,
I remember

366
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,366
feeling something like that.

367
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:06,629
I had this...

368
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,286
weird idea that my shadow
was this...

369
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,985
being that was somehow...

370
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,335
part of me.

371
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:21,165
And he... uh, it seemed like a he.

372
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:26,649
He was someone who knew
what I was thinking,

373
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,174
and he knew
my most secret secrets.

374
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:32,612
And...

375
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:35,223
he loved me, and he always had.

376
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,230
So you do know
what I'm talking about.

377
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,843
I'm sorry I can't
be more to you, Max.

378
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,236
But you know what?

379
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,631
I am here now, so...

380
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,852
What?

381
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,639
Hey.

382
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,772
Hey, you canceled
your date for this.

383
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,082
I hope you find him.

384
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,743
Oh, my goodness.

385
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,138
No, no, no,
not the pinkie, not yet.

386
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:25,491
Oh, we don't want
to rush things along, Thomas.

387
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:28,276
After all,
the evening is so young.

388
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,671
Mm.

389
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:32,715
Ooh!

390
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,674
Don't... don't hog the beauty.

391
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,632
Come on.

392
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:38,460
Mr. Cortland.

393
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,898
So beautiful.

394
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,596
- Mr. Cortland.
- Mm.

395
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,380
Sir, the young gentlemen
have arrived.

396
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,817
Ah, good.

397
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:57,479
Well done.
- Thanks.

398
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:10,100
Well, now,
I think we have a winner.

399
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:13,103
Young man...

400
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,628
I have a job for you.

401
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,195
Nice to see you too.

402
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:20,023
Hey, there he is.

403
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:29,468
Is that really you?

404
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:30,904
You escaped?

405
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,340
Yes.

406
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,083
Deidre, what a happy surprise.

407
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:40,174
You look just like your mother.

408
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:41,436
All grown up.

409
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:44,308
- Thank you.
- Mm.

410
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,310
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

411
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:48,965
Oh, not for you, cher.

412
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,793
Uncle Cortland.

413
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,668
No, for you, only the best.

414
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,321
You can't imagine
the number of times

415
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:58,975
I've driven by your house
and thought

416
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,238
I should stop and throw stones
at your window,

417
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,501
try to get you out of there.

418
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,546
I wish you had.

419
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:07,244
Well, I'm sure it would
only make more trouble

420
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,117
between you and my sisters.

421
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:14,948
So here's to you,

422
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,906
here at last

423
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:19,082
and such a delightful surprise.

424
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:26,960
Hmm, I am so glad
you're wearing this.

425
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,485
You know, this belonged
to your mother.

426
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:34,097
The aunts never talk
to me about my mother.

427
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,058
Aw, well, now, they are wicked.

428
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,974
The worst kind of wicked.

429
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:42,715
Well, here's what I remember.

430
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:46,283
Your mother was full of life...
and mischief.

431
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,069
When she'd laugh, it was like

432
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,593
fireworks lighting up the sky.

433
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:54,248
And she was funny

434
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:57,251
and so beautiful.

435
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:01,429
Course, she paid
for her high spirits.

436
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:06,129
I don't believe
she jumped from the balcony.

437
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,394
You might be right.

438
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:13,180
And I want you to promise me

439
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,703
you'll be careful.

440
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,359
Hi.

441
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,274
I'm Patrick.

442
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:21,797
My friend from the other room

443
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,233
dared me
to ask you to dance, so...

444
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,629
- Sure, go ahead.
Dance. Have fun.

445
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,196
That's what we're here for,
isn't it?

446
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:30,719
Go on.

447
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,425
Don't forget to leave
a glass slipper, cher.

448
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,062
Patrick?

449
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,901
Miss Mayfair, your aunt is here.

450
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,381
She's insisting you come
downstairs right away.

451
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:01,843
Hello?

452
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:03,932
This is Ciprien Grieve.

453
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,934
I'm the agent in charge
of your daughter's file.

454
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,632
Oh.

455
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:11,331
Thank you so much
for calling me back.

456
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,942
- I...
- I'm at the house now,

457
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,378
the house on First Street
in New Orleans?

458
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,424
I see.

459
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,121
Uh...

460
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:22,646
I guess I was just
wondering if...

461
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,997
anything has...

462
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:29,001
been disturbed or... or different.

463
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,525
Well, if you're
asking if the man is here,

464
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,875
I don't see him, but...

465
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,095
I can feel him.

466
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,748
He's very near.

467
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:42,971
So this is... This is good news.

468
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:44,755
He's here.
Your daughter's there.

469
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:45,669
2.000 miles between them.

470
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,671
So...

471
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,673
you can breathe
a little easier, right?

472
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,762
For now,

473
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,635
but time is running out for me.

474
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,376
I need to know

475
00:30:56,506 --> 00:31:00,467
what's gonna happen
the next time you call me

476
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,599
and no one answers.

477
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,474
I need to know who is going
to keep my daughter safe,

478
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,867
Mr. Grieve.

479
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,478
I will.

480
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,921
I'm the one that will
keep your daughter safe.

481
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:22,576
Let's take a deep breath.

482
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:25,318
Feel the air in our lungs.

483
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:27,842
Celebrate, for a moment,

484
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,539
the great gift of life, huh?

485
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,063
Come on.

486
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:36,764
Ah, felt good, didn't it?

487
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,509
I don't know about you, but...

488
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:46,600
I'd like to keep doing that
for another, oh, I don't know,

489
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,515
twenty, thirty...

490
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,430
thousand years.

491
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:56,871
I'm Daniel Lemle,
CEO of Revenia Research.

492
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,004
And here at Revenia,

493
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,397
we believe death is encoded.

494
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,531
If there is a code,

495
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,706
we can crack it.

496
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,751
And if we can crack it,

497
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:08,665
then we can hack it.

498
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,019
Before I go,

499
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:16,630
take a moment
and look at each other.

500
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,112
See, you...

501
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:24,333
are the first generation
of human beings

502
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:26,553
that just might live forever.

503
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,648
Did you like my speech?

504
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,128
Hi. I did.

505
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:38,260
I just... I hadn't put together
that the position

506
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:41,263
I applied for is part
of longevity research.

507
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,570
Oh, you could see
the overlap, of course.

508
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,615
I mean, cure cellular
malfunctions in humans,

509
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:49,271
and you've eliminated almost
all the reasons we croak.

510
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,404
I did wonder, though,

511
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:53,101
why does a hotshot neurosurgeon

512
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:55,060
who studied microscopy
and gene sequencing

513
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,672
end up looking
for a research gig here?

514
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:01,283
Then I learned
about your mother.

515
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:04,417
I make calls for all
prospective hires.

516
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,071
It's OK.

517
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:07,072
Of course you want your mother
in one of our trials.

518
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:08,290
I get it.

519
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,510
When I first got to Revenia,

520
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,513
I put my wife on the board,
and all hell broke loose,

521
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:16,168
the other board members
screeching about nepotism.

522
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:17,647
She wasn't qualified,
no added value...

523
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,301
I mean, on and on.

524
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,477
What did I say back to them?

525
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:23,436
Fuck off.

526
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:29,616
Well, I-I do want my mother
in the trial.

527
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:31,661
I think she's
a suitable candidate,

528
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,446
and... and I don't think
that there's anything wrong

529
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,318
with being personally motivated
to... to want a job.

530
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:38,973
And I think... I think
it'll make me work harder.

531
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:42,368
My point exactly,

532
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,674
which means
my hunch about you was right.

533
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:47,155
Now, come downstairs,

534
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,070
and I can show you
where you'll be working.

535
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:52,769
Wait. I... so I-I got the job?

536
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,249
Come on.

537
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:58,427
The hours will be long,
and I need to know now

538
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:00,081
how that's gonna fly
with the husband,

539
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:01,996
boyfriend, kids.

540
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,084
None of the above.

541
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:04,520
All right. Check it out.

542
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,218
It's a Rodin.

543
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,307
I got a great deal
at a private auction.

544
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,093
Do you like modern art?

545
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,271
You know, Judy Chicago has
some kind of performance piece

546
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,186
at the de Young tonight.

547
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:21,102
My wife's busy,
and I have an extra ticket.

548
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:26,151
I can't tonight, but I, um...

549
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:29,154
I'll get in touch with HR
to get my paperwork started.

550
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:31,112
And I have all
my mom's records with me.

551
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,810
The... the tough thing
with the trial is,

552
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:36,378
we only have so much room,
of course.

553
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:38,815
I'll have to rejigger things
to get your mom in,

554
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,340
which I'm happy to do.

555
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,347
I do have a reputation
for being tough.

556
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,610
If you work here,
you got to run with the boys...

557
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,481
And the girls.

558
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:55,180
You got to think like a killer,
yeah?

559
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,444
Metaphorically, of course.

560
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,967
I know a lot of doctors
who are killers

561
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,143
and not just metaphorically.

562
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:06,278
So...

563
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:08,236
pick a name.

564
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,064
Let's get your mom
in this thing.

565
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:12,414
- Pick a name?
- There's 30 slots.

566
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,503
We already have 30 patients.

567
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:17,376
It doesn't matter to me which
patient your mom replaces.

568
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:22,076
I'm sure you can just
add my mom to the list

569
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:24,513
and... and make it 31.

570
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:25,993
I'm sure you haven't dealt
with the FDA before.

571
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,082
They're Nazis about this stuff.

572
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,954
30's the number, so...

573
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,913
go on, pick a name.

574
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:39,049
Please don't do this.

575
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,181
This is my mother's life,

576
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:41,748
and she's... she's all
that I have.

577
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,402
But I can't just pick a name.
- Dr. Fielding.

578
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:45,752
Those are just names in a trial.

579
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:47,319
Cross one out.

580
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:49,103
Don't get tangled
in the minutia, huh?

581
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:50,583
You mean patients.

582
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,062
Look.

583
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,631
You got a job to do.

584
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:58,156
I got a company to run.

585
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,418
Pick a name.

586
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:07,208
If my mother saw me pick a name,

587
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,123
she would drop dead on the spot

588
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,820
way before the cancer
could kill her.

589
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:16,304
I can't pick a name.

590
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,437
Don't tell me my hunch
about you was wrong.

591
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,310
I hate being wrong.

592
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:25,008
Because someone like you is
never really wrong, are they?

593
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,706
After all, you're so powerful.

594
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:27,968
You're so special.

595
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,970
All right.

596
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,494
Maybe, uh...

597
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,714
Yeah, maybe you don't get
what we're doing here.

598
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:36,542
I know what I'm doing here.

599
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:39,719
I'm pretending
that I find you interesting,

600
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:42,330
pretending that I think
you're smarter than me,

601
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:45,377
pretending that I admire you,
but I don't admire you.

602
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:49,076
In fact, I see through you
to the small, needy man-child

603
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,513
with the raging ego,

604
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,733
the dupe who overpays
for a fake Rodin,

605
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:56,039
the bully who can only
feel good about himself

606
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,564
if everybody else is minutia.

607
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,479
You think that you
should live forever. Why?

608
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,655
So that you can piss
in front of more women

609
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:04,483
or play God
with cancer patients' lives?

610
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:06,398
Or maybe you think
that you should never die

611
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:08,835
simply because you're such
a dazzling gift to the world,

612
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:10,489
so busy changing it.

613
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,049
What is it?

614
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,529
What happened?

615
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:54,359
Mom, it happened again,

616
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,926
just like it did
with Keck and Lucy Stone.

617
00:37:57,057 --> 00:38:01,017
Ex-except this time, I lost
my temper and I made it happen.

618
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,672
Rowan, I cannot hear this.

619
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,674
I have to face it.

620
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,589
I have to face what's happening.

621
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,635
There's something
really wrong with me.

622
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,943
I have some... some kind of...

623
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:16,294
Of monstrous power.

624
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:17,382
Rowan.

625
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:20,123
Rowan, I am tired.

626
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:25,172
I cannot hear this nonsense.

627
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,132
You do not have a power.

628
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,181
Listen to me.

629
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:40,666
You have got to get
ahold of yourself.

630
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:43,756
You cannot give in
to this twisted thinking.

631
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,323
It is dangerous.

632
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:51,459
And I will not
spend my last days worrying

633
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,463
that you are gonna get sucked
into some sick delusion.

634
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:02,035
Rowan...

635
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,733
just be with me.

636
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:08,171
That's all I'm asking.

637
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:09,999
That's all I want.

638
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:14,830
OK.

639
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,585
Deirdre, it's Father Duffy.

640
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:36,678
You need to open the door
right this minute.

641
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:00,006
So this boy...

642
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:01,486
Patrick.

643
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:04,402
He hasn't called or visited you?

644
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:06,882
He can't visit
because he's dead.

645
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:11,409
The body that they carried out,

646
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,019
it was him.

647
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:14,412
You don't know that.

648
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,152
I know what I know.

649
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:19,112
Aunt Carlotta, she killed him

650
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:21,680
because he made me happy.

651
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,856
She was there when they
took his body away.

652
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,466
Deirdre...

653
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:28,817
how can I help you
when you tell tales like this,

654
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:31,603
a crazy story about your family
killing a boy?

655
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:34,432
I'm not lying,
and you know I'm not.

656
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:41,700
You know the awful things
that happen in this family...

657
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,528
in this house.

658
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,705
Weren't you the one they called

659
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:48,881
when my mother
was pushed from the balcony?

660
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:51,927
She jumped...

661
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:54,190
because she was
in such pain and turmoil,

662
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:56,628
God rest her soul.

663
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:59,413
And now I'm worried
for your soul,

664
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,328
for the soul of your child.

665
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:07,116
I can't help but think
there was no boy at that party,

666
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:10,511
that this has happened
because of the man.

667
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,038
He didn't do this.

668
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,390
I haven't seen him
since that night.

669
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,789
Father, please,

670
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,184
I have to get out of here...

671
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:34,100
before something
even worse happens.

672
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,582
Please... help me.

673
00:41:39,105 --> 00:41:43,588
The surest and truest
help I know comes from God.

674
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,590
Will you at least pray with me?

675
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:50,203
You're scared of them...

676
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,773
Like everyone else.

677
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,516
Just go.

678
00:41:58,646 --> 00:41:59,560
Go!

679
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:21,207
Darling...

680
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,600
No.

681
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:28,780
Lasher.

682
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,303
You know where to find me.

683
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:42,184
Dear God, the darkness is here.

684
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,362
The darkness is in her,

685
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:49,322
that sweet, beautiful girl.

686
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:52,891
It's growing in her.

687
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:58,418
I fear for her
and for her unborn child.

688
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,813
Oh, dear God, I fear for us all.

689
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:07,079
I fear what we may have to do.

690
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:26,446
Give me one good reason to live.

691
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,375
That baby is coming.

692
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:45,639
She will change everything.

693
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,380
She will change
your life forever.

694
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:54,692
She won't.

695
00:44:56,737 --> 00:45:00,872
She will be stuck with them,
just like I am.

696
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:03,875
And you can't take us
away from here.

697
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:06,051
Yes, I can.

698
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,925
I'm yours already.

699
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:15,147
The necklace you wear,
it binds us together,

700
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:21,588
Ah,

701
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,982
but only because your mother
made that choice for you.

702
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:28,595
Now you're old enough to make
that choice for yourself...

703
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:32,381
To bind with me
of your own free will.

704
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:36,559
So take it off.

705
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,091
And I will show you.

706
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,791
I will show you who I really am.

707
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:56,449
And if you're strong enough
to face this...

708
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,713
I will be yours entirely,

709
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,584
yours to command.

710
00:46:05,414 --> 00:46:07,373
Do you want to see
who I truly am?

711
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,031
I do.

712
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,688
I am everyone.

713
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,257
I am no one.

714
00:46:24,433 --> 00:46:26,044
I'm a saint.

715
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:28,176
I'm a demon.

716
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:34,966
Will you take me, Deirdre?

717
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:37,838
Will you take me
to be yours forever?

718
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,380
You are my witch now.

719
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,749
May the Lord

this baby can never,

Any woman that makes a deal
with the devil gets burned!

799
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:51,706
When they come for us,
we have to stand together.

800
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,753
You have real power.

801
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:57,103

need to behave like a Mayfair.

This episode is called
"The Witching Hour,"

806
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:29,962
and it's named
"The Witching Hour"

807
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:32,094
because that is the title of the
first book

808
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:33,835
in Anne Rice's Mayfair trilogy.

809
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:36,751
Michelle Ashford and I,
who created the show together,

810
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:39,885
really wanted to signal that we
were embarking on,

811
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:43,715
in this first season, telling
the story of this first book.

812
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:48,807
Where did he go, the man
who was just talking to her?

813
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:51,244
What man?

814
00:54:54,029 --> 00:54:58,120
Rowan is this extraordinarily
independent spirit.

815
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:01,472
I love this character who's,
like, out in the open ocean,

816
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:04,126
on a boat, in the elements,
on her own,

817
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:05,911
but part of the mystery of Rowan

818
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:08,435
is that she's searching for
who she is,

819
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:11,482
she's searching for an
understanding of where home is.

820
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:14,136
I was telling
the Uber man about you.

821
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:16,225
Yeah? Yeah, and he said,

822
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:17,792
"If she's such a fancy doctor,

823
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:20,534
why does she live on a boat
like a dropout?"

824
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:24,146
Did you tell him,
"so I can travel the globe

825
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:26,323
searching for home"?

826
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:27,802
I'm your home.

827
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:31,589
Is Ellie her true home, or is
there some other, larger

828
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,591
home and family out there?

829
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:35,941
The hours will be long,

830
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:38,378
and I need to know how that's
gonna fly with the husband,

831
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:40,424
boyfriend, kids?

832
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:41,729
None of the above.

833
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,165
It felt really important

834
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:46,255
that we see Lemle as someone
who's stopping her

835
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:49,824
from being able to achieve what
she wants to achieve,

836
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:53,393
which is a real natural desire
to save her mother's life.

837
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:56,875
Pick a name, let's get your mom
in this thing.

838
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,006
Pick a name?

839
00:55:58,137 --> 00:55:59,399
There's 30 slots.

840
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,227
We already have 30 patients,

841
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,491
doesn't matter to me which
patient your mom replaces.

842
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:07,712
What he's saying to her is,

843
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:10,062
I have an instinct
that you are a killer.

844
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:14,240
If my mother saw me pick a name,

845
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,850
she would drop dead on the spot

846
00:56:15,981 --> 00:56:17,896
way before the cancer
could kill her.

847
00:56:18,026 --> 00:56:21,639
And in arguing with him that she
is not a killer,

848
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:24,555
that he is wrong about her,
she kills him.

849
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,648
And so, in fact, he was right

850
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:33,520
in his instinct about her
in some way.

851
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:36,218
This is a question that's gonna
plague Rowan

852
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:38,220
through the entire first season,

853
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:40,005
"Am I a destroyer or not?"

854
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:45,053
What about the man?

855
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:47,142
I hardly ever see him anymore.

856
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:48,927
Deirdre...

857
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:50,755
Lying is also a sin.

858
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:54,759
Deirdre has been locked up in
the First Street House

859
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:57,892
and not allowed to go anywhere
except to school

860
00:56:58,023 --> 00:57:01,896
and to confession, because her
aunts are so terrified

861
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:03,681
of the power of Lasher,

862
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:06,248
who is this being who's
connected to her.

863
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:09,556
Stop it! Stop it now!

864
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:12,907
This is one of the scenes that
comes out of the book,

865
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:15,475
where rose petals are falling,
and young girls

866
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:18,130
outside the church are dancing
in them,

867
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,828
and that idea that,
throughout her childhood,

868
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,918
there's then been this magical
being in her life

869
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,269
who showers her with rose petals
and makes her feel special

870
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,880
and makes her feel divine,

871
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,926
is a part of the seduction
of this figure, Lasher.

872
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:36,757
How many times have I told you
not to encourage him?!

873
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:38,542
I didn't ask him to come.

874
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:43,547
Why can't you see that I am
trying to protect you?!

875
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:46,419
Just go to your room.

876
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,074
And think about
what you've done.

877
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:53,078
She believes Lasher is the only
one who sees or understands her

878
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:57,082
because her aunts have made any
kind of other human interaction

879
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:58,910
impossible for her.

880
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:05,307
Cortland is
such a wonderful character.

881
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:07,614
Don't hog the beauty, come on.

882
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:10,530
Just full of that Mayfair,
kind of,

883
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:13,664
joy and lavishness
and decadence.

884
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:16,318
You can't imagine the number of
times I've driven by your house

885
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:18,973
and thought, I should stop and
throw stones at your window.

886
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:20,497
Try to get you out of there.

887
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:22,020
I wish you had.

888
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:26,024
Well, I'm sure it would only
make more trouble

889
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:28,156
between you and my sisters.

890
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:30,245
So...

891
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:31,551
Here's to you.

892
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:34,119
An he's also a nefarious
character,

893
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:36,861
he's got all kinds of
hidden agendas,

894
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:39,646
the snake seemed to
embody him perfectly.

895
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:44,216
You know I'm worried
for your soul,

896
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:46,653
for the soul of your child.

897
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:50,352
It felt really important that
Rowan's birth,

898
00:58:50,483 --> 00:58:52,572
the origin of this character,

899
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:55,749
be embedded in the story
of the pilot.

900
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,403
We wanted the audience

901
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,232
to be in on the secret of
Rowan's origins,

902
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:02,930
this kind of fairytale story of
this baby

903
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:06,238
who's taken from a family,
moved somewhere else,

904
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:09,241
doesn't know who she is,
doesn't know her name.

905
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:14,899
Anne Rice's book is all about
mothers and the power of women.

906
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:17,336
I wanna see her! She needs to see
the doctor first.

907
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:19,599
No! Carlotta!

908
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:22,907
No! Bring her back! No!

909
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:26,780
So, it felt really important to
have Rowan's birth

910
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:28,782
in this first episode.

911
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:34,875
This baby can never, ever
know who she is.

912
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:37,835
It'd be too dangerous for this
family and for her.

913
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:39,967
Whatever you say, Aunt Carlotta.

914
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:52,284
We wanted to end the episode
with Rowan out in the elements

915
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:56,723
again just as we met her, but
with so much having changed.

916
00:59:56,854 --> 01:00:00,945
She's lost her mother, she is
beginning to think of herself

917
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:05,036
as a kind of monster who has a
power she doesn't understand.

918
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:08,517
And in Deirdre's story,
this necklace comes off

919
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,868
and now Lasher
has been released.

920
01:00:10,998 --> 01:00:15,350
I want to know who
Deirdre Mayfair really is.

921
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:20,834
What will happen now that Lasher
has come into proximity

922
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:22,140
with Rowan?
