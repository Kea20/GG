00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:01.958
Hey! Kid!

2
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:04.833
Get your ass down here!

3
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:07.791
Come on!

4
00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:09.958
Hey! Jump, motherfucker!

5
00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:23.250
All right. Cool.

6
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.541
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

7
00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:27.125
And this is for you guys.

8
00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:28.708
Thank you.

9
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:32.583
Charlie, the kid tipped us, bro.
You owe me 20.

10
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.375
Hey, you're a good guy.
Not too many left in this city.

11
00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:40.500
- Move the fucking truck, sister!
- Damn!

12
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:45.166
Hey, we got to take off.
You can handle that last piece, right?

13
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.458
Yeah, I got it.

14
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.083

Jabari!

62
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.750
- Hey, what's up, Carmen?
- Hey.

63
00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:30.208
How you been?

64
00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:32.041
Good. Good.

65
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:33.375
Hungry?

66
00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:34.500
Hmm?

67
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:40.375
Oh, yeah! Nah. Ky and Jimmy are coming
to break in the new crib.

68
00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:42.791
I figured Chinese was the easiest way
to do that.

69
00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.416
Don't have forks and shit yet.

70
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.791
- You moved?
- Yeah. Today, actually.

71
00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:47.916
Just down the way.

72
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.583
You live in Manhattan?

73
00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.791
I know. Crazy, right?

74
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.458
It is. You're selling that many sneakers
at Flight Club?

75
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.875
Actually, I don't even work there anymore.

76
00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.666
I work at Cosmic Comics now.

77
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.875
Get the fuck out of here! Doing what?

78
00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:06.708
Well, they want me to turn Mr. Rager
into a comic book.

79
00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:08.458
What?

80
00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.666
Jabari, that's big!

81
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.416
I'm so happy for you.

82
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.583
Thank you.

83
00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:18.750
Don't say "thank you" like that,
like it's fucking normal.

84
00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:20.750
Yeah. You're right. It's not.

85
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.541
Carmen. What you want?

86
00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.000
Oh, I gotta go.

87
00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:32.000
But, um, maybe a drink sometime
to celebrate?

88
00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:34.500
Yeah. Yeah. For sure. I'm down.

89
00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:36.333
- That'd be dope.
- Great.

90
00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:37.833
It was really good to see you.

91
00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:39.458
Yeah, you too.

92
00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:02.625
I swear there's a dog whistle that lets
women know as soon as you get lit.

93
00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:06.541
Oh, you got a promotion?
Hey, big head! Every time!

94
00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:10.708
Ky, she ain't hitting me up.
I ran into her on the street.

95
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.250
Coincidence? I think not.

96
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:16.125
Yeah, come on. What the fuck, bro?
That's no coincidence.

97
00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.791
- My man.
- That is fate.

98
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:19.875
Your man.

99
00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:24.083
Wait, just hear me out.
You haven't seen Carmen in how long?

100
00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:26.875
Like, five, six months. Why?

101
00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.083
Six months?

102
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:30.750
Bro, and nothing?

103
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.083
And on the day you move
into this one percent-ass apartment,

104
00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:37.166
she just Beetlejuices back into your life
out of nowhere?

105
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.791
- She's not back in my life, Jimmy!
- "You're not..." Good! Keep it that way.

106
00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:43.958
We don't need Carmen in here trying
to "Carmen up" your whole situation.

107
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:48.166
Bari, I hate to say it, but Jimmy got
a point. You're a bachelor now.

108
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.000
This is a bachelor pad.

109
00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:53.625
You need, like, velvet couches,
soft lighting,

110
00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:56.375
and nice wines and wine glasses and shit.

111
00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.625
Right, you could listen
to Scarface over here,

112
00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:03.291
or do we turn this place
into a grow house?

113
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:05.708
Look at all this natural light!

114
00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:11.166
Yeah, I think I'm just going to hit a CB2.

115
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.083
- Oh, yeah, they got some nice stuff.
- Yeah, the Lenny Kravitz collab is fire.

116
00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:45.333
Stop!

117
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.083
Okay.

118
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.208
Didn't I look so good today, Jabari?

119
00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.875
Go ahead, DM me.

120
00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.416
Oh, fuck it.

121
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:50.958
Okay, okay, okay.

122
00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:55.750
- Sorry.
- All good.

123
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.750
- Hey!
- Hey.

124
00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:07.958
- So, what's up?
- What can I get you guys?

125
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:10.750
- Uh, I'm a...
- He'll have a whiskey and ginger beer.

126
00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:14.208
But if you don't have ginger beer,
ginger ale is fine.

127
00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:18.125
And she'd like to try
your four driest whites.

128
00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:22.541
She's not going to love any of them,
but the process is part of the experience.

129
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:26.208
Ha ha. I'll just take whichever white
you think is best.

130
00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:27.291
Mm-hmm.

131
00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:33.250
Who are you, and what have you done
with the Carmen I know?

132
00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:36.541
I've just figured out that everything
doesn't have to be perfect.

133
00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:40.750
I am Chill Carmen. Carmen 2.0.

134
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.833
Here you go.

135
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:46.541
Thank you.

136
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.458
Mm!

137
00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.666
To Carmen 2.0.

138
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.166
To Carmen 2.0.

139
00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:01.208
We're celebrating you tonight!

140
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.250
Okay, you trying to rage, huh?

141
00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:04.750
Don't see why not.

142
00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:08.291
Yo, can we get two shots of tequila?

143
00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:09.416
Make it six!

144
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.416
What the fuck? Six?

145
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.500
Hell, yeah!

146
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.000
If we're gonna celebrate,
let's fucking celebrate!

147
00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:40.958
This is my favorite one you've ever done!

148
00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:43.500
Oh, I gotta take a picture.

149
00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:46.458
Besides, it's for my Stush profile.

150
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.750
You know, since I'm single.

151
00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:50.708
Oh! You're on Stush?

152
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.250
Just take the picture.

153
00:10:57.041 --> 00:10:58.916
Wait, you got to back up.

154
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:07.708
Keep going.
You got to get the whole vibe.

155
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.125
- Happy?
- Very!

156
00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.583
- All right.
- "Aight"? You just took one!

157
00:11:21.416 --> 00:11:23.291
All right. I got like three!

158
00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:27.458
Take like 15. I need options.
And use a flash.

159
00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:32.500
Oh, my God!

160
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.458
Are you okay?

161
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.791
I probably have rabies now,
but other than that, I'm good.

162
00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:13.750
I know. I know.

163
00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:16.416
Right.

164
00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:18.291
I'm not sure.

165
00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:22.541
Mm-hmm.

166
00:12:24.291 --> 00:12:25.291
He's right here.

167
00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:28.458
- Who is it?
- My mother.

168
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.958
What? Why does she want to talk to <i>me</i>?

169
00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.666
Hey! Mrs. Atkins.

170
00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:40.750
Your niece's christening? Um...

171
00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:42.416
Okay.

172
00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:45.166
Yeah, I have a suit.

173
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.208
Oh, okay.

174
00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.125
Mom, we gotta go.

Yeah, I went for a run. Yeah.

00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:21.011
You don't have to come
to the christening if you don't want.

Uh-huh.

185
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.416
I just told my mom you were here,
and she got really excited to see you.

186
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.708
Are you getting in?

187
00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:31.750

Nah.

192

193
00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:55.666
Okay.

194
00:13:57.041 --> 00:14:01.125
I just think this was a mistake.

195
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.083
Huh.

196
00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:07.250
Could you be more specific?

197
00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:09.833
I don't know.

198
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:13.583
We have a few drinks and I'm already
at a christening with your mom?

199
00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:16.583
- Bari, I told you, you don't have to come.
- I know. I know.

Carmen, I just have

I don't want to be with someone right now.

202
00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:27.416
No, you don't want to be with me.

203
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.916
Honestly, I can't be with anyone.

204
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:32.916
It's really not about you.

205
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I'm sorry.

But inside, it's all about bright, lite,
and white, my bro. You know what I mean?

345
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:19.291
Nah, fam. Look...

346
00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:22.541
...Lin, right?

347
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:23.833
My bro.

348
00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:26.458
I think Cosmic brought me in

349
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:29.583
because they wanted something raw,
you feel me?

350
00:23:29.666 --> 00:23:31.708
Well, maybe. Maybe.

351
00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:34.333
But trust me, there's one thing I learned,

352
00:23:34.416 --> 00:23:36.708
you don't change Cosmic Comics, my bro.

353
00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:38.458
Cosmic Comics changes you.

354
00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:43.458
Oh! Nice!

355
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.208
Hey, are you on Stush, my bro?

356
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.291
Nah, man.

357
00:23:46.375 --> 00:23:51.208
What? You are wilding, my bro.
I am cleaning up on here.

358
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.375
<i>La morenas,</i> ooh, they love the Lin.

359
00:24:06.166 --> 00:24:07.458

360
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:51.541
Ah!

361
00:25:04.708 --> 00:25:05.875

Whoa!

364
00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:10.708
My bro!

365
00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.083
Suck on this, bitch.

366
00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:46.833
Thanks, Mr. Rager.

367
00:26:46.916 --> 00:26:49.125
I, uh... I, uh...

368
00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:52.791
Yo, what the fuck are you wearing?

369
00:26:52.875 --> 00:26:55.458
Oh, this? It's my new look!

370
00:26:55.541 --> 00:26:58.083
Fire, right?
Bright, white, and lite, baby.

371
00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.916

No, but this is a private party.

00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:53.958
Yeah, I get that.
I'm just looking for the host.

Okay. And... and don't worry.
We're winding down.

438
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.791
Nah, it's fine!

439
00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:36.750
Turn the music back up! Party! Turn it up.

440
00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:39.541
I don't want to be a party pooper
or nothing like that.

441
00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:42.083
Okay.

442
00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:45.541

443
00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:46.625

465
00:33:01.458 --> 00:33:05.208
Uh, so I just want to apologize
for last night.

466
00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:08.958
I feel so bad. I did not mean
for things to get so out of control.

467
00:33:09.041 --> 00:33:10.625
It's all good. All good.

468
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.291
I can't be mad at a Friday night turn-up.

469
00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:15.125
But I can be mad at your music.

470
00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:17.333
Uh...

471
00:33:17.416 --> 00:33:18.583
I'm sorry?

472
00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:20.958
Yeah, was that Dru Hill?

473
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:23.708
Okay, pre-"Thong Song" Sisqó was fire.

474
00:33:23.791 --> 00:33:26.625
Yeah, but never forget
post-"Thong Song" Sisqó.

475
00:33:26.708 --> 00:33:27.708
Fair.

476
00:33:28.666 --> 00:33:32.333
Anyway, in trying to ease
my guilty conscience, I...

477
00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:35.083
I just wanted to stop by and see
if I could treat you to lunch.

478
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.125
You know, just to make up
for any lack of sleep.

479
00:33:38.208 --> 00:33:39.916
Cool. That's what's up.

480
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.833
Great!

481
00:33:40.916 --> 00:33:43.750
- Uh, how long do you need?
- Oh, shit.

482
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:45.875
You're trying on now. Uh, all right.

483
00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:48.458
- Uh, give me a minute to get it together.
- Okay.

484
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.791
Are you ready?

485
00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:18.625
- Ready.
- Cool.

486
00:34:18.708 --> 00:34:21.458
Just so you know,
I'm ordering two of everything.

487
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.625
So, you're a photographer?

488
00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:37.791
Yeah, I never leave home without her, so...

489
00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:42.416
- What?
- Uh, it's nothing.

490
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.958
I actually really like that.

491
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:47.875
The whole "men walking curbside" thing
is the one chivalrous thing I'm into.

492
00:34:47.958 --> 00:34:48.833
Why's that?

493
00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:50.500
It shows you're willing to die for me.

494
00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:52.625
Okay. Sure.

495
00:34:54.708 --> 00:34:56.083
- Hey, Corey.
- Hey, girl.

496
00:35:00.333 --> 00:35:02.041
I don't usually bring people here.

497
00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:05.250
Why? Because of the one-star Yelp rating?

498
00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:07.375
Uh, no.

499
00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:09.625
Because this is my secret spot.

500
00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:13.916
I'd take a burger from here
over a fancy dinner any day.

501
00:35:14.458 --> 00:35:19.875
Thank God. I half expected you to take me
to some mung bean vegan situation.

502
00:35:19.958 --> 00:35:22.125
Oh, yeah? I give you that vibe?

503
00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:23.333
Just saying.

504
00:35:24.583 --> 00:35:25.791
You guys ready?

505
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.583
Do you trust me?

506
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:31.041
All right. All right.

507
00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:32.625
We'll have two specials.

508
00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:33.875
Coming right up.

509
00:35:34.708 --> 00:35:37.500
So, when do I get to see
some of your photos?

510
00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:41.958
Well, if you find yourself
at the Studio Museum, they'll be there.

511
00:35:42.041 --> 00:35:44.333
Hold on. Big flex.

512
00:35:44.416 --> 00:35:46.916
Did you say your work's gonna be
in a museum?

513
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.166
Mm-hmm.

514
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.625
That's fucking dope! Congrats!

515
00:35:50.708 --> 00:35:53.291
Thank you. I mean, it's a month from now.

516
00:35:53.375 --> 00:35:56.250
It's a group show.
I... I'm just... I'm really excited.

517
00:35:56.833 --> 00:35:58.708
I mean, I'm terrified,
but I'm really excited.

518
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:00.625
Um...

519
00:36:00.708 --> 00:36:02.208
You never told me what you do.

520
00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:04.208
Oh. Yeah. Um...

521
00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:08.708
I created this character, and I draw him
around the city on buildings and shit.

522
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:11.416
- Wherever, really.
- Like Mr. Rager?

523
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.875
You seen my shit?

524
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.708
Wait, wait, wait. Mr. Rager? That's you?

525
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:18.833
I'm a fan!

526
00:36:18.916 --> 00:36:19.833
Aw.

527
00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:22.208
- Thank you.
- No, really! I'm a fan.

528
00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:27.083
Actually, I just got a deal with Cosmic
to turn Mr. Rager into a comic.

529
00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:30.625
Like a comic book?

530
00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:31.708
Yeah.

531
00:36:32.208 --> 00:36:33.208
Okay.

532
00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:35.041
Cool.

533
00:36:35.416 --> 00:36:37.791
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no. That's dope.

534
00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:41.166
Just don't let them <i>Deadpool</i> up your shit.

535
00:36:43.708 --> 00:36:45.083
Nah, never that.

536
00:36:45.166 --> 00:36:46.875
Special two times.

537
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Thank you.

538
00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:52.000
Dig in. And you're welcome.

539
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:01.708
Oh, my God. This is fucking amazing!

540
00:37:01.791 --> 00:37:04.958
Right? Not bad for a mung bean
vegan situation.

541
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:06.041
Hmm?

542
00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:09.916
The special burger is vegan.

543
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.833
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:37:11.916 --> 00:37:14.166
This spot doesn't even look like
it'd seat a vegan!

Wow.

580
00:40:05.708 --> 00:40:07.041
Thanks for the burger.

581
00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:08.791
Burgers. Plural.

582
00:40:10.166 --> 00:40:12.666
Hey, I told you I was gonna order
two of everything.

583
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Well.

584
00:40:17.958 --> 00:40:18.958
Whoo... Oh...

585
00:40:26.375 --> 00:40:27.375
Meadow!

586
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.625
Today was fun.

587
00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:33.833
Yeah, it was.

588
00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:56.750
Never date a neighbor.

589
00:40:57.291 --> 00:40:59.041
Trust me. I know.

590
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:04.375
<i>One time, I met this white girl
in the laundry room of my building.</i>

591
00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:12.583
<i>Body? Crazy.</i>

592
00:41:13.375 --> 00:41:17.666
<i>Face? Eh. But body? Crazy.</i>

593
00:41:20.916 --> 00:41:23.541
<i>She asked me for, like,
eight fabric softener sheets.</i>

594
00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:28.083
<i>Next thing I know, we're fucking.</i>

595
00:41:29.625 --> 00:41:31.375
both grunting

596
00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.458
<i>I was smacking for two weeks straight.</i>

597
00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:39.916
<i>She never wanted to go home,
I was piping so good.</i>

598
00:41:45.458 --> 00:41:46.750
<i>Shit was amazing!</i>

599
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:53.021
<i>Then one day, I'm making a protein shake...</i>

600
00:41:53.083 --> 00:41:56.458
<i>...and somebody starts beating on my door
like the goddamn police.</i>

601
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:59.333
<i>So I go to see what's up, and it's Ice!</i>

602
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:01.291
Wait, man. Like Ice-T?

603
00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:05.333
<i>Nah, nigga, like I.C.E.,
the immigration niggas.</i>

604
00:42:05.416 --> 00:42:09.375
<i>These niggas were like,
"We're looking Fedogia Katznosov."</i>

605
00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:12.458
<i>I'm like, "Huh?"
Then dude holds up a picture.</i>

606
00:42:12.541 --> 00:42:14.791
<i>I'm like, "You mean Keisha?"</i>

607
00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:18.708
<i>Turns out she was a Russian hacker
squatting in the laundry room.</i>

608
00:42:18.791 --> 00:42:21.750
<i>And they was trying to charge me
for housing this bitch.</i>

609
00:42:21.833 --> 00:42:23.916
Now I can't even do my laundry anymore.

610
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.416
Dick gets hard
every time I smell a Bounce sheet.

611
00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:28.875
I have so many thoughts,

612
00:42:28.958 --> 00:42:33.625
but let's start with the fact that
technically, she wasn't your neighbor.

613
00:42:34.208 --> 00:42:35.875
Damn. I guess you're right.

614
00:42:36.541 --> 00:42:38.125
But still, don't do it.

615
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:40.958
Is that the Beyoncé niggas?

616
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:43.166
Oh!

617
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.375
This party 'bout to be crazy!

618
00:42:50.125 --> 00:42:52.208
So, when's date number two happening?

619
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Uh...

620
00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:55.875
After date number one.

621
00:42:55.958 --> 00:42:59.916
So asking a guy to lunch,
taking him to your favorite restaurant,

622
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.500
going for a romantic stroll in the rain
doesn't constitute as a date?

623
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:07.416
I was on a date, huh?

624
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.166
- You were on a date.
- Karina!

625
00:43:10.833 --> 00:43:12.666
I'm just happy you met someone.

626
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.791
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, pump your brakes,
Charlotte York.

627
00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:17.250
We just had lunch.

628
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.500
Whatever.

629
00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:21.166
Mm-mm. No. Try the other ones.

630
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.850
You just don't want me to wear these
'cause they're your favorite.

631
00:43:23.916 --> 00:43:27.041
Girl, I could care less. Wear 'em all.

632
00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:30.041
I haven't been in anything
but Birkenstocks since month four.

633
00:43:32.583 --> 00:43:35.250
All right, I gotta hurry up.
Reed says he's two minutes away.

634
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:36.958
That man!

635
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:39.375
He looks like Park Avenue Prince Harry,

636
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:42.833
and I'd be down to bow before the crown.

637
00:43:42.916 --> 00:43:44.596
Does your husband know
that you're in heat?

638
00:43:45.166 --> 00:43:47.000
Oh, these.

639
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.123
Wait, wait, wait.

640
00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:50.333
I get not mixing business with pleasure,

641
00:43:50.416 --> 00:43:55.208
but you mean to tell me you've never
been curious about Reed's...

642
00:43:56.875 --> 00:43:57.708
pleasure?

643
00:43:57.791 --> 00:44:00.458
Reed? No.

644
00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:02.416
Besides, all white dudes
look the same to me.

645
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.666
You mean to tell me there's no white man
that could turn your head?

646
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:10.125
Chris Hemsworth? Liam Hemsworth?
Any Hemsworth?

647
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:13.250
- Nope.
- How can you just rule them all out?

648
00:44:14.416 --> 00:44:15.416
Oppression.

649
00:44:22.708 --> 00:44:27.958
"No, we will not sell for Bitcoin."

650
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:29.458
You fucking idiot.

651
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.000
What... Really?

652
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:34.291
What? You know I hate these things.

653
00:44:34.375 --> 00:44:37.458
I do, but it's my job
to take you to these things,

654
00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:40.875
because it's these people who are going
to eventually buy your work.

655
00:44:40.958 --> 00:44:43.750
This is gonna be one of your weird
fucking art parties, isn't it?

656
00:44:48.041 --> 00:44:50.208
You brought me to a vagina party?

657
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:51.291
Too weird?

658
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.375
You shouldn't be scared.
You have one, right?

659
00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:55.458
Reed!

660
00:44:55.541 --> 00:44:57.166
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

661
00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.541
The host, Sydnie Ardmore,
also my ex-girlfriend.

662
00:45:00.708 --> 00:45:02.083
Oh.

663
00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:04.166
- This is gonna be fun.
- Sydnie!

664
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.458
Reed!

665
00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:08.833
I'm so glad you could make it.

666
00:45:08.916 --> 00:45:11.875
- I didn't know you were bringing a date.
- Nope. Not his date.

667
00:45:11.958 --> 00:45:14.958
No, no, this is Meadow Watson.

668
00:45:15.041 --> 00:45:18.416
She's the insanely talented photographer
I wanted you to meet.

669
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.375
- And buy.
- What?

670
00:45:20.458 --> 00:45:23.625
Hello, Meadow. I'm sure if this one
is parading you around town,

671
00:45:23.708 --> 00:45:25.041
your work must be dope.

672
00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:26.041
Oh, thank you.

673
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:28.791
Yeah, I am totally looking forward
to seeing it.

674
00:45:28.875 --> 00:45:33.125
I'm so sorry, I do have to steal Reed away
for just a second.

675
00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:35.625
- Oh, yeah. No, go for it.
- I'll be right back.

676
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:52.583
Bro, this shit is even getting
too weird for me.

677
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:56.166
Yeah, but these pusscroons are fantastic,
I will say.

678
00:46:00.666 --> 00:46:01.666
Oh, shit!

679
00:46:03.208 --> 00:46:05.000
Man, the fuck are you doing?

680
00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:06.208
That's my neighbor.

681
00:46:06.291 --> 00:46:09.208
The one I was telling you about.
She's standing at the bar!

682
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.458
Not her over there
with the cirrhosis of the liver?

683
00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:16.375
That's not her, man.

684
00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:20.666
Oh, nah, she bad.

685
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.875
Fuck everything I said about neighbors.
She worth getting deported to Russia for.

686
00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:34.625
Hey!

687
00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:38.458
Holy shit! What are you doing here?

688
00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:40.791
This doesn't really seem like your vibe.

689
00:46:40.875 --> 00:46:42.375
Could say the same for you.

690
00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:48.875
Ah.

691
00:46:49.541 --> 00:46:51.458
Yeah, no.

692
00:46:51.541 --> 00:46:54.041
Didn't think it was in the cards
for me to see you so soon.

693
00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:57.500
You live down the hall.
Sounds like you need new cards.

694
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.583
Right. But right now, I'm pretty happy
with the ones I've got.

695
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.125
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Lady, you crazy!

696
00:47:07.208 --> 00:47:09.666
- No dicks allowed!
- Shit, shit, shit!

697
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.208
Wow. Okay.

698
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:13.250
Yeah. You want to get out of here?

699
00:47:13.791 --> 00:47:14.791
Mm-hmm.

700
00:47:19.916 --> 00:47:21.208
Give you a ride home?

701
00:47:21.291 --> 00:47:22.500
You drove?

702
00:47:27.625 --> 00:47:29.333
You gonna ride that to valet?

703
00:47:29.416 --> 00:47:31.125
Ha ha. Funny.

704
00:47:31.791 --> 00:47:32.666
Nah, get on.

705
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.916
You know, I came here in a Maybach.

706
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.125
Yeah, and you're leaving on a Mongoose.

707
00:47:37.916 --> 00:47:40.875
Unless you don't want to ruin that little
cocktail dress of yours.

708
00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:43.041
What is that anyway? Prada?

709
00:47:43.125 --> 00:47:45.958
It's Valentino. And don't try and play me.

Mm-hmm.

743
00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:45.625
It's round 12.
Your mans is wobblin'! He's weak.

744
00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:49.250
Let's light him up! Jab, jab!
Right hook! Uppercut!

745
00:49:49.333 --> 00:49:50.333
No dick?

746
00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:52.666
No kiss?

747
00:49:53.166 --> 00:49:54.166
No nothing?

748
00:49:55.125 --> 00:50:00.208
Let's go. We need that KO!
Five, four, three, two, one!

749
00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:06.666
Hey, Creed, next time just fuck him.

750
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.750
All right, then what happened?

751
00:50:10.833 --> 00:50:13.416
Then I just took her home.

752
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.791
In an Uber, right?

753
00:50:14.875 --> 00:50:16.750
No, she hopped on the back of my bike.

754
00:50:16.833 --> 00:50:19.666
What? You rode a bitch home on your pegs?

755
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.666
I mean, it's no Italian super scooter.

756
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.375
Hey, bitches love horsepower.

757
00:50:24.458 --> 00:50:26.375
Stop saying "bitches," okay?

758
00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:29.083
And please don't tell me
you'd actually wear that helmet.

759
00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:32.416
Oh, I always wear a helmet.
Safety first, bro.

760
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.416
How do you think I've been able to stay
chlamydia-free since '03.

761
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.583
How old were you in 2003?

762
00:50:37.666 --> 00:50:40.000
Shit. Old enough to feel the burn.

763
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:44.333
Look, we spent all day together, okay?

764
00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:48.458
So when we got home,
we just said good night, and that was it.

765
00:50:48.541 --> 00:50:51.625
- Not even a good-night smooch?
- Dude, she's my neighbor.

766
00:50:51.708 --> 00:50:53.041
I just moved into the building.

767
00:50:53.125 --> 00:50:55.458
I'm not trying to fuck the vibes up,
you know what I mean?

768
00:50:56.583 --> 00:50:57.833
Dude, you all right?

769
00:50:58.333 --> 00:50:59.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

770
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:02.416
I was just blown away
by Bari's bitch-ass-ness.

771
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.416
You know, Rob and I
fucked in the bathroom on our first date.

772
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.750
Wait, what? At the UNICEF masquerade ball?

773
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:11.250
That's just what we decided
to tell people.

774
00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:12.791
Our real first date?

775
00:51:13.666 --> 00:51:15.958
<i>It was a typically fine blind date.</i>

776
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.666
<i>Except for the fact that he wanted
to eat at Ninja New York.</i>

777
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:22.291
<i>Ninja New York?</i>

778
00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:25.666
Rob is weird.
He has a thing for feudal Japan.

779
00:51:26.666 --> 00:51:29.500
<i>I was bored out of my mind.</i>

780
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.625
<i>But my punan felt differently.</i>

781
00:51:33.791 --> 00:51:34.833
<i>Your what?</i>

782
00:51:35.375 --> 00:51:37.000
What? Punan?

783
00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:39.041
Punan, punan, punan.
Girl, just let me finish.

784
00:51:39.708 --> 00:51:43.291
<i>I tried to pay attention,
figured I could push through.</i>

785
00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:45.708
<i>But she was not having it.</i>

786
00:51:46.541 --> 00:51:49.083
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

787
00:51:49.166 --> 00:51:50.458
<i>I had a choice.</i>

788
00:51:50.541 --> 00:51:54.416
<i>I could leave this fine date
with this nice guy,</i>

789
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.875
<i>go home alone and break out my vibrator,</i>

790
00:51:56.958 --> 00:52:00.375
<i>then wait for him to text me,
I don't know, three to five days later</i>

791
00:52:00.458 --> 00:52:04.083
<i>for a second date
at Medieval Times or some shit.</i>

792
00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:05.375
<i>Or...</i>

793
00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.083
<i>we could be legends.</i>

794
00:52:13.583 --> 00:52:14.708
Hey!

795
00:52:14.791 --> 00:52:17.583
<i>Now, it might have
only lasted 35 seconds, but...</i>

796
00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:22.875
<i>oh, legends we were.</i>

797
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:28.458
You trifling. You busted it open
at Ninja New York?

798
00:52:28.541 --> 00:52:31.750
Look, all I'm saying is
there is a time to follow your heart,

799
00:52:31.833 --> 00:52:34.791
a time to follow your punan,
and a time to follow...

800
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:38.958
That guy.
Whatever he's eating, I want that.

801
00:52:39.458 --> 00:52:40.916
<i>My name is Jabari,</i>

802
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.333
and a bad bitch wants to have sex with me,

803
00:52:43.416 --> 00:52:45.625
and I'm too scared of the pussy.

804
00:52:45.708 --> 00:52:47.291
Wah! Wah!

805
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:49.333
Played yourself.

806
00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:51.750
No. Chill, bro. I hear you, Bari.

807
00:52:51.833 --> 00:52:53.625
Like for me, I can't fuck with a chick

808
00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:56.333
unless I'm sure she can hold it down
if I have to...

809
00:52:57.958 --> 00:52:59.041
you know, go away.

810
00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:02.791
Jimmers. Weed is legal.
Where are you going away to?

811
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:06.083
I'm not talking about weed, man.
I'm talking about plastics.

812
00:53:07.666 --> 00:53:09.833
I'm working on some stuff.

813
00:53:09.916 --> 00:53:12.708
Put that pussy down, man.

814
00:53:13.708 --> 00:53:16.000
Be well, Cheeto. Be well.

815
00:53:17.083 --> 00:53:18.250
<i>I don't know, Rina.</i>

816
00:53:18.333 --> 00:53:22.833
I'm standing in that hallway last night,
and literally all I wanted to do was bone.

817
00:53:22.916 --> 00:53:25.958
I mean, right there,
hanging from the incinerator door.

818
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:27.916
Just wild, wet...

819
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.208
Sloppy. Choking.

820
00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:33.333
Oh, like right up to the point
of losing consciousness.

821
00:53:34.333 --> 00:53:35.250
Mm!

822
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:41.875
Oh God, I hate this feeling.

823
00:53:41.958 --> 00:53:44.833
You like him. It's just butterflies.

824
00:53:44.916 --> 00:53:47.208
Oh, no, no, no.
It is not just butterflies.

825
00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:50.791
I know what these tingles are,
and it is more than just sex.

826
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:54.958
Okay, but maybe,
and just playing devil's advocate here,

827
00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:57.916
maybe those tingles are telling you
to look out,

828
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.208
'cause this could be something good.

829
00:54:00.291 --> 00:54:05.166
Meeting someone in the city is a big deal,
so let it be a good big deal.

830
00:54:05.666 --> 00:54:08.666
All I'm saying is be open. Okay?
Just be open.

831
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.541
And by "open," I mean your punan!

832
00:54:13.791 --> 00:54:16.875
Look, man, I just don't want you
to end up in the friend zone,

833
00:54:16.958 --> 00:54:19.291
watering her houseplants
and feeding her cat

834
00:54:19.375 --> 00:54:22.916
while she on a month-long meditation
retreat with some nigga named Villard.

835
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.666
Oh, man.

836
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.750
Bro. Who hurt you?

837
00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:28.625
Remember, be open!

838
00:54:28.708 --> 00:54:31.125
Yeah. Yeah. Love you.

839
00:54:31.208 --> 00:54:33.291
All right, you guys.
I'm gonna get some work done.

840
00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:36.541
What you need to work on
is your fine-ass neighbor.

841
00:54:36.625 --> 00:54:40.958
The heart wants what the heart wants,
but the punan needs what punan needs!

842
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:43.958
- I'm not fucking my neighbor!
- I'm not fucking my neighbor!

843
00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:55.333
Get it together, Meadow.

844
00:54:57.958 --> 00:54:59.666
Okay. All right.

845
00:55:11.833 --> 00:55:12.833
Hey.

846
00:55:13.416 --> 00:55:14.416

I've known her for like ten years.

954

You need to go actually break up
with this girl, man.

962
01:02:04.583 --> 01:02:06.750
She's calling because she doesn't know
she's your ex.

963
01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:09.333
- That's fucked up.
- Like face-to-face?

Ooh! She a wild one, bro.

965
01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.208
I don't want to call the cops
on this girl.

966
01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:15.250
Why were you dating a girl
you'd have to call...

967
01:02:16.291 --> 01:02:18.375
Why date a girl
you'd have to call the police on?

968
01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:22.125
Shit, yo. It ain't true love
unless the police are involved!

969
01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:27.333
Oh!

970
01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:29.291
- Shit.
- Damn.

971
01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.458

972
01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:34.333

973
01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:37.875
- What's up, boys?
- Downtown Pat, what's good, baby?

974
01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:39.166
Hey, bro, need help with that?

975
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Could you hold this for a second?

976
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.291
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

977
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.291
Love is a motherfucker, boys.

978
01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:52.916
I remember I met this girl once at a rave.

979
01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:57.250
I was tripping my balls off on 'shrooms,

980
01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.500
and she saw all the fun that I was having,

981
01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:01.833
and she asked, how much to get like me?

982
01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:05.250
And I says, "How much?
Man, this love is for the community."

983
01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:09.833
So I hit her a couple caps,
and we're dancing the fucking night away.

984
01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.208
But dig this.

985
01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:16.833
I woke up at my crib the next morning,
and all my shit was gone.

986
01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.833
Bitch stole everything.

987
01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:23.500
When I finally tracked her down,

988
01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:27.000
she said she stole my shit
so I would remember her.

989
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.791
All right, this girl sounds crazy.
And I'm out.

990
01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:37.958
I know that sounds crazy right now.

991
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:41.958
But, man, at the time, that shit
was the sexiest thing I ever heard.

992
01:03:42.458 --> 01:03:44.166

01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:36.750
Yeah, I know.

1031
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:40.333
It was a "felt cute, might delete later"
sort of thing.

1032
01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:43.916
Besides, it's not like it's nothing
you haven't seen before.

1033
01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:49.166
I just don't think we should be
sending each other stuff like that.

1034
01:05:50.833 --> 01:05:51.833
Okay.

1035
01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:55.333
You know,
seeing how we're just friends and all.

1036
01:05:56.666 --> 01:05:58.083
Okay, Jabari.

1037
01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:04.291
Also, I was with somebody
when you sent it,

1038
01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.166
and they saw it,
and it's kind of become a thing.

1039
01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:10.333
Oh.

1040
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:13.916
Well, sorry.

1041
01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:16.291
Uh...

1042
01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:21.875
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you,
were you <i>with</i> somebody

1043
01:06:21.958 --> 01:06:23.375
or were you "with" somebody?

1044
01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:25.875
I don't really see the difference.

1045
01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:30.500
Okay, well, the difference is,
how long have you been with this somebody?

1046
01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:32.333
- Because you fucked me a month ago.
- What?

1047
01:06:32.416 --> 01:06:34.536
The last time we hooked up,
I hadn't even met her yet.

1048
01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:36.708
- That's not the point, Jabari!
- You're right.

1049
01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:41.541
The point is, I don't think that
this friendship thing is working out.

1050
01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:45.041
Yeah, well, I agree. I wasn't trying
to be friends in the first place.

1051
01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:49.000
You said you couldn't be with anyone,
but clearly that was a lie.

1052
01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:51.333
Carmen, I didn't come here
to argue with you.

1053
01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:57.500
So, this person you're with,
is she your girlfriend?

1054
01:06:57.583 --> 01:06:58.583
No.

1055
01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:00.625
But...

1056
01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:09.375
I am so stupid.

1057
01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:14.208
You should go.

1058
01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:25.500
You'll be blocked
before you get downstairs.

1059
01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:30.291
Because, you know,

1060
01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:32.750
I-I went to school
right up the street from here.

1061
01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:37.041
Who would have thought I'd be here
a couple years later?

1062
01:07:37.125 --> 01:07:38.416
Hold on a second.

1063
01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:40.041
Yo!

1064
01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:42.625
Hey. What's up, Nadia?

1065
01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:46.541
Ain't shit. Just trying to get
some press in before the show.

1066
01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:49.958
- Wow, your stuff is looking dope.
- Yeah, my bad.

1067
01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:52.458
I know I kind of took over
some of your space.

1068
01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:54.416
You haven't been here
setting up or anything,

1069
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.916
so I just assumed
you weren't doing the show.

1070
01:07:57.625 --> 01:07:58.625
Um...

1071
01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.875
Yeah, uh...

1072
01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:03.458
Oh, I see what you doing.

1073
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:07.250
You trying to hit us with that
Beyoncé drop on opening night!

1074
01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:12.250
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
You know me. Dramatic.

1075
01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:14.541
Yeah, but that's what makes you dope.

1076
01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:15.458
Yeah.

1077
01:08:15.541 --> 01:08:18.791
All right, girl.
Let me get back to this white man.

1078
01:08:18.875 --> 01:08:22.375
I see you later, all right?
Hey! You break it, you bought it, Jerry!

1079
01:08:22.458 --> 01:08:25.875
I'm looking, not touching.
Not my first gallery tour.

1080
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:45.875
Yo.

1081
01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:47.541
Oh.

1082
01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:48.625
Hey.

1083
01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.166
Um...

1084
01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:01.041
Headed back out?

1085
01:09:01.458 --> 01:09:03.875
Yeah, I got a, um... a thing.

1086
01:09:04.833 --> 01:09:09.541
Look. I know this morning's shit
probably seemed very fuckboyish,

1087
01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:12.291
but I just want to say
that I'm not a scumbag.

1088
01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:18.083
My ex just had the wrong idea
about what it means to be friends,

1089
01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:21.666
but I cleared that up now,
so there's no lingering drama.

1090
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:22.833
Fuck yes.

1091
01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:24.708
Oh yeah.

1092
01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:25.708
Um...

1093
01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:29.208
The whole "ex sext" thing
was definitely weird.

1094
01:09:31.708 --> 01:09:33.458
Were you really with her yesterday?

1095
01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:38.958
Yeah. But I didn't...

1096
01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.458
Look, I gotta go, okay?

1097
01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:44.125
Wait. Wait. Wait. Whoa.

1098
01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:45.458
Meadow.

1099
01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:48.125
I know that sounds crazy,
but nothing happened.

1100
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.583
What I'm trying to say is,

1101
01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:54.333
I'm sorry if that hurt you.

1102
01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:58.500
I really like you,
and I want you to know you can trust me.

1103
01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:07.583
Listen, Jabari,
I really like you too, but...

1104
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:12.958
You know, I think all of this is moving
way too fast, and you and I,

1105
01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:15.500
I mean, we both have a lot going on.

1106
01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:20.208
So I think we should just, like,
take a second.

1107
01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:22.791
Med.

1108
01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:27.291
I'm sorry, I just can't do this right now.
I really can't. I gotta go.

1109
01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:36.541
Fuck.

1110
01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:42.208
- I get it. Crypto.
- Hello.

1111
01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:44.791
Hi. I'm supposed to be meeting Reed.

1112
01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:47.166
Hey, superstar. Carol, I got her.

1113
01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:48.875
Hey.

1114
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:50.250
Oh.

1115
01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:52.208
Are you freaking out?

1116
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:54.625
Don't!
You know, you artists are all the same.

1117
01:11:54.708 --> 01:11:57.833
A couple weeks out from a show,
and you guys turn into the walking dead.

1118
01:11:59.708 --> 01:12:03.375
Meadow, relax. You are amazing.

1119
01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:05.458
Your show will be amazing,

1120
01:12:05.541 --> 01:12:09.291
and everyone is going to love your work.
You should be proud.

1121
01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:11.000
Thanks. I, uh...

1122
01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:13.833
- I needed that.
- Yeah, anytime.

1123
01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:15.875
Uh, now, come on. Everyone's waiting.

1124
01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:18.416
What? I thought we were
just grabbing dinner real quick.

1125
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.416
We are.

1126
01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:22.916
Just with a couple friends.

1127
01:12:26.416 --> 01:12:27.958

- Can't wait to see more.
- Great stuff, Jabari.

1154
01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:47.371
Love your work, bro!

1155
01:15:47.416 --> 01:15:48.458
Awesome!

1156
01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:51.541
Ooh, my bro, you killed it!

1157
01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.375
Mark my words,

1158
01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:56.583
Mr. Rager's going to be
the biggest property at Cosmic.

1159
01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.541
Hey, so about the whole bright,
white and lite thing,

1160
01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:02.166
I was just looking out, you know?

1161
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.500
Just passing on some game. <i>Tomó la tu.</i>

1162
01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:06.125
You know, that's for you.

1163
01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:08.875
I didn't expect you to repeat it
in front of the whole board.

1164
01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:10.958
But, uh, hey, whatever, man. You know?

1165
01:16:11.041 --> 01:16:13.125
It's cool, fam. I appreciate it.

1166
01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:14.083
My bro.

1167
01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:18.625
Oh, something is totally bugged
with my Stush app.

1168
01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:21.333
I swear, they keep sending me
the same girls.

1169
01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:23.833
No, Rhonda and I are not
the perfect match!

1170
01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:25.083
Ugh! <i>Dios mio.</i>

1171
01:17:01.041 --> 01:17:02.958
Yeah!

1172
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:04.750
I love that one.

1173
01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:07.583
I think it's my favorite.

1174
01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.458
Yeah?

1175
01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:14.750
So, where's he going?

1176
01:17:14.833 --> 01:17:17.500
Uh, yeah.
I don't know if he's gonna make the cut.

1177
01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:19.166
What?

1178
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:22.666
But he just fits.

1179
01:17:25.166 --> 01:17:26.500
I'm not sure that he does.

1180
01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:30.125
Damn. Well, shit, you know better than me.

1181
01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:42.458
Mmm. Junior's Cheesecake.

1182
01:17:42.541 --> 01:17:44.541
Now this is my kind of Saturday.

1183
01:17:45.166 --> 01:17:49.541
Yeah. Well, I know that's the real reason
you come to visit your little brother.

1184
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.666
I'll come all the way from Queens for you.
But, damn, this is a close second.

1185
01:17:57.541 --> 01:17:58.916
How you holding up?

1186
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.750
I'm good. I'm good.

1187
01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:03.291
Us deciding to pump the brakes
was the right call.

1188
01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:07.375
Neither of us really wanted
nothing serious, so, you know...

1189
01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:09.833
- Really?
- What?

1190
01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:11.666
"Nothing serious"?

1191
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:14.916
Jeez, Jabari, you called me
about that girl.

1192
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
You barely call me on my birthday.

1193
01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:19.333
I don't know, Ellie.

1194
01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:21.958
I'm... I'm fucked up.

1195
01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:25.500
I never felt this way about a girl before.

1196
01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:30.208
Have you talked to her?

1197
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:31.625
No, I'm cool.

1198
01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.250
Ow! What the fuck?

1199
01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:36.708
Bro, don't let your pride make you
miss out on something good.

1200
01:18:36.791 --> 01:18:38.541
You need to tell this girl how you feel.

1201
01:18:38.625 --> 01:18:40.500
- I tried that.
- Then try again.

1202
01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:44.416
Love is the easiest thing in the world
when it happens by accident,

1203
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.625
but it doesn't get real
until you do it on purpose.

1204
01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:16.208
There she is!

1205
01:19:16.291 --> 01:19:17.375
Hey, guys.

1206
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:21.250
I am so fucking proud of you, Meadow.

1207
01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:22.708
- Aw.
- We both are.

1208
01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.875
Thank you, and thank you for coming.

1209
01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:25.958
Oh, shut up.

1210
01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:28.000
We wouldn't miss this for the world.

1211
01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:31.000
And besides, I will take any excuse
to get dressed up.

1212
01:19:31.083 --> 01:19:33.875
And look, I'm back, bitch!

1213
01:19:33.958 --> 01:19:35.041
I see.

1214
01:19:37.916 --> 01:19:40.125
Babe, can you grab me another champagne?

1215
01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:42.833
It's Mama's night out.

1216
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.083
All right, talk to me.

1217
01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:47.875
He's not coming.

1218
01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:50.208
Sweetie, did you ask him to come?

1219
01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:53.250
No. I don't know.

1220
01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:56.625
Somewhere deep down,
I just thought he'd show up.

1221
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I feel kind of dumb, I guess.

1222
01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:03.541
Okay, first off,
this night is not about him.

1223
01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.166
It's about you.

1224
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:08.250
And you shouldn't feel anything
but magic tonight.

1225
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.000
And second,

1226
01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:13.416
it's okay to be disappointed, Meadow.

1227
01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:16.375
Here's the truth.

1228
01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:19.958
Everyone's just out here
looking for their person.

1229
01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:23.791
Maybe Jabari is your person. Maybe not.

1230
01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:26.750
But you've got to be willing
to put yourself out there

1231
01:20:26.833 --> 01:20:29.208
if finding your person is what you want.

1232
01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.166
Karina...

1233
01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:31.833
It sucks. I know.

1234
01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:33.125
And it's scary.

1235
01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.625
But it's on you, Meadow.

1236
01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:38.458
It's on you.

1237
01:20:43.458 --> 01:20:50.208
So, it just gets me tight that people
equate New York with gray and darkness

1238
01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:52.333
when the city's mad colorful.

1239
01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:55.125
Like, even the people are so colorful.

1240
01:20:55.875 --> 01:20:57.875
So in my work, I try to showcase that.

1241
01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:05.916
Yo, Nadia. Shit. I feel you.
Seriously, I feel it in your work.

1242
01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:10.416
Um, anyway, Meadow, tell me about you.
Is that what drew you to photography?

1243
01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:13.166
Oh, thank you.

1244
01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:15.208
Uh...

1245
01:21:17.416 --> 01:21:21.250
I... I guess what I like the most is...

1246
01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:26.166
It's...

1247
01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:31.750
It's the ability to capture a moment.

1248
01:21:33.666 --> 01:21:35.458
It's the ability to stop time.

1249
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:41.625
Because sometimes moments
can get too big for us.

1250
01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:46.166
You know, we get scared, and we... we run.

1251
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:47.250
We fold.

1252
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.708
We do the wrong thing.

1253
01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:54.958
We say the wrong thing,
and then just like that,

1254
01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:57.500
the moment has passed.

1255
01:21:58.958 --> 01:22:03.708
So I guess I just like having the ability
to just pause a moment forever

1256
01:22:03.791 --> 01:22:08.500
in the hopes of the impossibility
of just getting back to it.

1257
01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:10.583
Doing it over.

1258
01:22:15.083 --> 01:22:18.541
Hopefully that answered your question
and that made some sense.

1259
01:22:18.625 --> 01:22:21.125
And if it didn't, I'm just gonna blame it
on the fact

1260
01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:23.583
that I'm, like, super hungry right now.

1261
01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:27.958
Really. I'm just thinking about
what I'm gonna eat after this.

1262
01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:40.166
You were just amazing.

1263
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:42.375
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1264
01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.708
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1265
01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:47.625
- Absolutely brilliant.
- Yes. Thank you so much.

1266
