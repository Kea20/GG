00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.541
Huh?

2
00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:07.958
No!

3
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.208
The alarm has started ringing,

4
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:23.750
and we keep hitting
the ecological snooze bar again and again.


5
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.291
But unfortunately,
there seems to be no escape.


6
00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:27.958
I'm afraid the end is near.

7
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.125
So, the problem's really that bad?

8
00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:33.000
With every passing second,
we get closer to the end.


9
00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.083
NEWS

10
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.875
- Is it really happening that fast?
- Yes! Even faster than you can imagine.


11
00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.625
Listen. As I speak to you right now,

12
00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:55.250
exactly one million plastic bottles
are being purchased around the planet.


13
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.375
And 20,000 of them
have already been thrown away.


14
00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.750
We pollute the environment
with our garbage worldwide,


15
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.125
constantly buying things and foolishly
throwing them out without thinking.


16
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:08.500
Hmm? Hmm, yeah, you're so right.

17
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:14.541
The fate of the entire planet
is in our hands.


18
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:17.625
We have to make it to the broadcast
as soon as possible.


19
00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.416
Whoa!
Do you mind if we get there in one piece?


20
00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:23.625
Hey! Oh! My butt!

21
00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.541
Hey, Necati. Are you okay?

22
00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:29.666
Oh, I... I'm fine. No problem.

23
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.083
I'm camouflaging my face
for this operation.


24
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.291
And under my eyes.

25
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:39.458
So, are there enough dump sites
in the world


26
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.416
to take care of all the world's garbage?

27
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.208
No, of course there aren't.

28
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.125
Would you like to know
what the problem is?


29
00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:48.750
The problem is that we're throwing away
more than we're recycling.


30
00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.916
Take bags of potato chips, as an example.

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.416
Come on, they're everywhere.
It's horrifying.


32
00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.833
Okay. Let's take a look
at what everyday people are saying.


33
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:04.291
So we should apply the zero-waste method
to every aspect of our lives.


34
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:05.875
That way, we won't pollute nature,

35
00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.500
and save the planet
as we recycle all our garbage.


36
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.875
What's that?

37
00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.250
- Yikes!
- Watch out, you crazy driver!


38
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.583
That was Mirket's van. He's nuts!

39
00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:20.333
Great, we've made it!

40
00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.583
Oh, whoa! Ow…

41
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:25.041
Come on, come on!
We have to get up there now!


42
00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.208
Dolma! Hummus! Kofta! Hamentasch!

43
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.500
His concussion's turned him
into an international menu.


44
00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:36.500
Necati! Come to your senses!

45
00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:39.708
Peking duck? Dumplings?

46
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.375
Char bao, chop suey,
Chinese chicken salad.


47
00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.000
The Necati you're trying to reach
is currently not available.


48
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.833
Come on, let's go!

49
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.750
So, what about that suggestion
from the little girl we just interviewed?


50
00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:58.375
I mean, she said something like, uh…
"Recycling, zero waste,"


51
00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.083
and I don't remember the rest.

52
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:03.166
Come on, that will take ages.
It won't work.


53
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.166
We've found more sophisticated solutions
to resolve environmental problems.


54
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.375
Don't worry.

55
00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:10.375
Don't tell me what
they are. Let me guess.

56
00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:13.625
Are you going to manufacture
giant garbage trucks?


57
00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:15.875
Like that one!
Look at it. Oh, that's sweet!


58
00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.708
It goes honk, honk, honk!

59
00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:19.500
In my opinion, it's a very good idea.

60
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:22.833
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Uh, okay, I think it's ridiculous too.


61
00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:26.166
- So what solution have you come up with?
- Ah! We met with many scientists,


62
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.750
and I thought of a great solution.

63
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.416
Although one of the scientists,
who's very annoying,


64
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.208
was quite opposed to my idea.

65
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.833
But I won't mention his name.

66
00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:37.041
No! There's no point.
That nincompoop quit and left anyway...


67
00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.583
Oh, let's say his name!
Here's his picture!


68
00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:43.791
- Oh, what a garbanzo bean!
- Hilarious!


69
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:46.791
- Garbanzo bean!
- His head looks just like a garbanzo bean!


70
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.250
- He's got a garbanzo head, all right!
- What a garbanzo bean!


71
00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:52.517
What are they saying?
I don't have a garbanzo bean head.


72
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.559
They kicked me off the project
for telling the truth!


73
00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:56.958
But you really do
look like a garbanzo bean.


74
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:58.916
Şakir? What are you doing here?

75
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.666
Well, Mirket and Necati
are gonna barge in on a live TV broadcast.


76
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.750
Why is that?

77
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:06.375
Because the officials are about to make
the wrong decision.


78
00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:09.750
I have to prove to those imbeciles
that I have a better idea.


79
00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.250
Look, guys.
The studio entrance is right there.


80
00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.750
But those guards
will never let us through.


81
00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:18.125
Well, if we can't get in this way,
I'll find another way.


82
00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:20.666
- Yeah, right. How?
- Just follow my lead.


83
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.125
But you have to be really quiet,
and not draw attention to...


84
00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:26.250
Mommy!

85
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.250
What is that? I'm scared!

86
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:31.291
Oh, it's okay. 
It's only my shadow.

87
00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:32.875
We can go now.

88
00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:39.750
Aha, behold!

89
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:43.333
The adventure gate that we special agents
see in all secret missions!


90
00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.125
Don't be silly. There's no such thing
as an adventure gate...


91
00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.250
Just be quiet and follow me.

92
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:54.291
Hey. Can you help me out,
garbanzo bean head?


93
00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.416
I'll show you "garbanzo bean."

94
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.750
Whoa!

95
00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.166
Thanks, GBH.

96
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.791
So what exactly is your solution?

97
00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.166
It's so simple.

98
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.083
You see, we're going to load
all the world's garbage


99
00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:07.750
in these huge space rockets.

100
00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:11.083
We'll use thousands of rockets.
And then... Here comes the payoff.


101
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.541
Whoosh! We launch them all into space!

102
00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:17.000
Problem solved. We're all good.
Goodbye, trash. See you never.


103
00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:20.000
Sending all our garbage into space?
Wait a second.


104
00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:23.583
Aren't we, uh, going to pollute space
just like we did on Earth?


105
00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:26.750
Come on. Out in space,
it's not Earth's problem.


106
00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:31.958
Where the heck is that studio?

107
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:35.250
It's 20 degrees south
and 12 degrees north.


108
00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:37.083
20 degrees straight ahead!

109
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.541
Okay, I think we're here.

110
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:44.833
My super senses are telling me
that the studio is right below us.


111
00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:47.083
Necati, are you sure
this is the right spot?


112
00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:50.000
Come on, chief.
Relax, I've got this covered.


113
00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.375
Very well, then.

114
00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.250
Hello, dear viewers!

115
00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:57.083
- Huh?
- What?


116
00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:04.458
Shame on you, Mirket.

117
00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:07.291
Bad, bad boy!
You shouldn't enter the ladies' restroom.


118
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:11.083
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- It was a mistake to believe you.


119
00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:12.916
Huh? Mirket, quick question.

120
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.666
What's heavier?
A pound of steel or a pound of Necati?


121
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.666
- What?
- Too late.


122
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.000
Whoa!

123
00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.875
Dear viewers, we are interrupting
our broadcast with breaking news.


124
00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.333
I have been informed
currently it's pouring pink elephants!


125
00:06:27.416 --> 00:06:30.291
Hmm. We'll make it a school holiday.

126
00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:33.375
Will elementary and middle school janitors
have time off as well?


127
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.166
- Huh?
- Oh!


128
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.458
This is the prime time news with slides!

129
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:41.333
Hip, hip, hooray! 
Hip, hip, hooray!

130
00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:44.500
Oh, wow! Oh, is this live? Hello!

131
00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:47.166
I'm shouting out a big hello
to everyone watching us


132
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.750
from all the tasty pastry shops out there.

133
00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:52.666
And also to the mincemeat and cheddar pie!

134
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.125
♪ Mincemeat and cheddar ♪

135
00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:56.541
- Hey, come here.
- You are not allowed in here.


136
00:06:56.625 --> 00:07:00.250
What do you mean?
No one can stop Special Agent Necati.


137
00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:02.833
I've been stopped.

138
00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:07.250
♪ Fly freely and return home safely ♪

139
00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:09.333
Get that person's number.

140
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.333
Nice move.

141
00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:14.500
Thanks to Necati, we've gotten rid of
the two security guards.


142
00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.375
And now it's my turn to act.

143
00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:20.041
So, when are you going to implement
this rocket solution?


144
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:24.291
We'll launch the garbage-carrying rockets
into space tomorrow morning,


145
00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:26.083
if everything goes as planned.

146
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:27.708
You heard it, dear viewers.

147
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:31.000
- Rockets full of garbage will be launched…
- Excuse me.


148
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.958
- …Into space tomorrow morning.
- I can't reach. I'm not tall enough.


149
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:35.833
Okay, good.

150
00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:38.708
- Ah! It's Garbanzo Bean Head!
- Security!


151
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.041
Security is gone.

152
00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:43.250
Now, all of you. 
All of you earthlings!

153
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:46.833
If you want to rid our planet of garbage
and secure its future,


154
00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:48.250
you'll listen to me.

155
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:52.083
- Uh, the camera's there.
- Oh, it's over there?


156
00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:54.791
Now, I'm going to show you
my new invention.


157
00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.125
Thanks to this device I've created,

158
00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:59.791
there will be no need
for ridiculous solutions


159
00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:02.166
like sending our garbage into space.

160
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.791
Mirket, don't bother showing us a thing.

161
00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:07.625
Stop wasting our time.
Your inventions never work.


162
00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:09.875
You're inept and incompetent.
Accept it already.


163
00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:12.291
I won't! This will work.

164
00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:16.125
I will destroy the garbage everywhere,
saving the entire planet.


165
00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:18.458
And you will witness it!

166
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.458
Now… let's take this bag of garbage.

167
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.000
Let me just adjust the settings. Uh-huh.

168
00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:28.583
Aha!

169
00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:41.583
You know, it's not gonna work.

170
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:01.458
Come on, Mirket, come on! 
You can do it.

171
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.083
Now watch it work!

172
00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:18.291
Yes, dear faithful viewers.

173
00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:21.541
Garbanzo Bean Head's invention,
as you all just witnessed,


174
00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:24.625
multiplies garbage
instead of destroying it.


175
00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:28.083
Well done, chickpea head!

176
00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:40.083
Wait, but... But it wasn't supposed
to be like this, I swear.


177
00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:53.125
Since that guy's invention didn't work,

178
00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:56.041
all those rockets
will be taking off tomorrow morning?


179
00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:57.291
Most definitely.

180
00:09:57.375 --> 00:10:00.750
This will be by far
the best solution for the whole world.


181
00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:04.958
Go home, baba ghanoush brain. Go home.
You go work on your lame inventions.


182
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:08.583
Look at him. He was going to
save the world with that stupid thing?


183
00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:12.708
Did he even test it before showing it
to us? And he calls himself an inventor.


184
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:15.583
Disgraced on a live broadcast
in front of the whole world.


185
00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:17.500
He deserved it.

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:33.125
I haven't recovered yet.
The cologne didn't work.


214
00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:36.208
You fellas, you'd better throw
two plates of rice in my face.


215
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.000
What you need is a super kick!

216
00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:40.750
A super kick, you say?
Will I get a real kick out of it?


217
00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.375
- One, two, super kick!
- Ready!


218
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.375
Guys, your kick was so delicious.
Can I have the recipe, please?


219
00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:56.833
Huh? Whoa. This is Mirket's invention.

220
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.250
I wonder why he threw it away.

221
00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:04.916
Huh? What'd I do?
What's happening? Why is it on?


222
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.500
Whoa! Wait a second!

223
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.750
Oh! Oh, my!

224
00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:12.083
Wait. How do I turn it off?

225
00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:50.083
Good night, Mirket. Good morning, Mirket.

226
00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:51.666
Good inventing to you, Mirket.

227
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.708
Nothing good about it,
Artificial Intelligence 4914.


228
00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:59.541
So did your garbage invention work?
Were you successful?


229
00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:03.583
I failed, big time.
All my inventions are failures anyway.


230
00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:06.583
My garbage destroyer didn't work.
It malfunctioned.


231
00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:08.791
It did something I can't explain.

232
00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:13.375
Look at them! Every one of my inventions.
They're good for nothing.


233
00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:16.500
Would you like me
to offer you some cookies?


234
00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:19.916
- Ow!
- A perfect landing.


235
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.333
Cookies are good for the hair, Mirket.
They are nutritious and delicious indeed.


236
00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:29.583
Enough! I'm so tired of this work.

237
00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:32.125
I don't want to think
about anything anymore.


238
00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:35.333
Come here!

239
00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:38.083
I'm throwing away all of my inventions.

240
00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:40.666
I'm not exhausting my brain anymore.

241
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.041
No one appreciates me
for trying to save mankind anyway.


242
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:46.833
Don't worry, Mirket.

243
00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:49.958
Your complete list of inventions
are all saved in my memory bank.


244
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:53.416
No more inventing.
No more math, no more physics.


245
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.333
I'm done! Even crossword puzzles.

246
00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:59.291
No more old Mirket!

247
00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:02.500
I like your positive attitude
towards life, Mirket.


248
00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:10.083
Attention, citizens!

249
00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:12.750
The trash rockets will be launched
tomorrow morning.


250
00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:16.000
We kindly ask you
to throw away the last of your garbage.


251
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:19.250
The rockets will be launched
tomorrow morning.


252
00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:22.166
We kindly ask you
to put all your garbage in the truck.


253
00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:26.083
Ah, my dreams, 
I'll miss you.

254
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.166
Goodbye. See you on the other side.

255
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.041
Good morning, Mirket.

256
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.958
Good night, Mirket.

257
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.333
The time has come.

258
00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:29.333
All the garbage in the world will be
launched into outer space this morning.


259
00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:32.875
I think this refuse rocket project
is a huge mistake.


260
00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958
The first garbage rocket
will be taking off soon.


261
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.916
If we pollute space,

262
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.333
I think even greater dangers await us
in the future.


263
00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:50.791
Five, four, three, two, one.

264
00:15:50.875 --> 00:15:52.125
Blast-off.

265
00:15:55.458 --> 00:15:57.291
Launch successful.

266
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.875
The first rocket to take
our trash into space has left our orbit,


267
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:10.458
and started a journey
far away in the vacuum of space.


268
00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:14.625
Officials have stated
that this solution will definitely work,


269
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:17.458
and more new rockets are being prepared.

270
00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:22.791
Future generations will never
forgive us for this ridiculous solution.


271
00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.625
This is a huge mistake!

272
00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:29.500
And one that might spell
the end of the world as we know it.


273
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.041
One year later.

274
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.958
Ugh. I have had enough.
I'm leaving this stupid ship!


275
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:43.250
Kadriye, don't be silly.
Where will you go?


276
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.708
You said we were going on a luxury cruise
in the South.


277
00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:48.166
Tell me where the beach is.
And where are the sun beds?


278
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.500
And the seafood buffet?

279
00:19:49.583 --> 00:19:52.583
We've been at sea for three months,
and all we've seen is snow and ice.


280
00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:55.208
Ice, snow. Ice, snow. Snow, ice.

281
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:57.208
- Ice, snow!
- What's nice?


282
00:19:57.291 --> 00:19:59.750
Not "nice", I said "ice." Ice!

283
00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:01.833
Just ice everywhere!

284
00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:08.083
Uh-oh.

285
00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:17.833
Kadriye, what should I do?

286
00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:21.166
Canan said we had to go south
to try to find Mirket.


287
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.708
How should I have known
that "south" meant the South Pole?


288
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:26.625
Don't make me even angrier, Remzi.
My goodness.


289
00:20:26.708 --> 00:20:30.458
It's so cold here that the words we say
freeze in the air when you say them!


290
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:31.875
LOOK

291
00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:34.833
Well, I think it's just great.
Look, Mom. Watch!


292
00:20:34.916 --> 00:20:36.375
"Adventure"!

293
00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:38.041
"Entertainment"!

294
00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:41.458
So, "dinosaurs shooting lasers
out of their eyes."


295
00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:44.083
I'll show you dinosaurs!

296
00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:46.166
Argh!

297
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.958
- Stop, Kadriye!
- Mom and Dad! Will you calm down?


298
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.375
I guess you've forgotten
why we came all the way here.


299
00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:53.583
We need to find Mirket
as soon as we can.

300
00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:56.375
We haven't been able to find him
for a year.


301
00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:58.541
I don't think we'll find him here either.

302
00:20:58.625 --> 00:21:00.583
It's like he just evaporated.

303
00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:04.583
By the way, who's looking after
the little ones right now?


304
00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:06.666
It has been a year

305
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.458
since the launch of the garbage rockets
into space, dear viewers.


306
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:14.916
About 5,000 rockets
have currently been launched from Earth.


307
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.833
And for now, everything is going well.

308
00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:21.375
The streets are much cleaner.
Everyone is happier and pleased…


309
00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:26.833
Hey, if you want some more food,
I can whip something up for you, okay?


310
00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:29.250
Hello, friends out there.
Welcome to my channel.


311
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.791
Today, we're at the South Pole.

312
00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:37.833
Dear brothers and sisters,
I ask you all to be a little serious now


313
00:21:37.916 --> 00:21:39.000
and to pay attention!

314
00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:41.083
You won't be
getting anywhere by behaving...


315
00:21:42.541 --> 00:21:45.083
Oh! Oh! Ow!

316
00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:47.458
♪ I'm a rappin' dude
And I like great food ♪


317
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:49.916
♪ I go out of my way
For a great buffet ♪


318
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.458
♪ I quiver and shake
For a slice of sweet cake ♪


319
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:53.750
♪ Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo ♪

320
00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:55.250
Necatis, what are you doing?

321
00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:56.916
- Huh?
- Oi!


322
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.916
Didn't I specifically tell you to behave?

323
00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:03.375
Argh!

324
00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:05.375
Help!

325
00:22:05.916 --> 00:22:07.416
Stop!

326
00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:13.500
It's starting to snow.

327
00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:15.791
Listen, kids.
If we're not gonna find Mirket,


328
00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:18.416
I'm gonna end this trip
as quick as possible!


329
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.416
Besides, Canan. What makes you think
that Mirket is at the South Pole anyway?


330
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.833
As I'm sure you know,
every month I go to look at the many bills


331
00:22:25.916 --> 00:22:28.125
piling up in front of Mirket's laboratory.

332
00:22:28.208 --> 00:22:30.416
While I was going over
his last credit card bill,


333
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.708
guess what I saw?

334
00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:34.000
- "Thermal underwear"?
- Underneath that entry.


335
00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:37.541
A hotel in Ushuaia.
So, what does that mean?


336
00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:40.333
Ushuaia is a city
in the south of Argentina.


337
00:22:40.416 --> 00:22:43.000
- And in Ushuaia...
- Oh! Ushuaia! Ushuaia!


338
00:22:43.083 --> 00:22:45.875
Who cares about that place?
I'm cold right now!


339
00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.083
Just get to the point!

340
00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:49.583
- Okay, okay. So, now, Ushuaia...
- Oh!


341
00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:52.083
Not to shock you, Mom,
but with the clues I've gathered,


342
00:22:52.166 --> 00:22:54.666
it seems
Mirket could be around here somewhere.


343
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.250
Possibilities, possibilities.

344
00:22:57.333 --> 00:22:59.916
You're clearly
chasing some dream again, Canan.


345
00:23:02.416 --> 00:23:06.500
Huh? Oh, for heaven's sake! What is that?

346
00:23:06.583 --> 00:23:09.291
- Something's falling from the sky!
- Huh?


347
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.166
Oh, my gosh. I think that's a spaceship!

348
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.500
We should go help them, Mom.

349
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:22.291
Yeah! Yeah!
It's an adventure. Let's go help them!


350
00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:24.875
Son, calm down. 
You come back here! Uh-oh.

351
00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:26.583
How do we know they aren't dangerous?

352
00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:29.125
- I have a bad feeling... Don't go there!
- I wanna go see!


353
00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:31.375
This is amazing!

354
00:23:31.916 --> 00:23:33.500
No running!

355
00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:37.291
Remzi! Go get the mini Necatis.
We're going too.


356
00:23:57.791 --> 00:24:00.916
- What kind of alien is this?
- Oh, it's starting to snow harder.


357
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.583
Come on already.
Let's all get back to the ship.


358
00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:06.625
Okay. Come on. Let's all lift
this thing up together, okay?


359
00:24:08.666 --> 00:24:11.041
Come on! It's heavy.

360
00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:12.875
Up!

361
00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:14.208
Okay, we gotta move!

362
00:24:20.416 --> 00:24:21.875
Guys, which way is our ship?

363
00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:24.000
I can't see anything in this snow.

364
00:24:24.083 --> 00:24:25.708
Stay close to each other!

365
00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:43.833
Oh! In a minute, we'll be frozen solid.

366
00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:46.625
It's okay, we're not lost.
Stop thinking that.


367
00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:51.208
Huh? It's a cabin.

368
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:52.708
Good. Let's get inside.

369
00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:05.291
Oh! I'm frozen!

370
00:25:05.375 --> 00:25:07.166
Lift it up, come on! Put it here.

371
00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:14.458
♪ Yo, I'm a rappin' Necati
And I'm cold as ice ♪


372
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:16.621
♪ And you know there's one thing
I'm spicy and nice ♪


373
00:25:16.666 --> 00:25:18.083
♪ Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo ♪

374
00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:19.625
Oh. Let's eat! Let's eat!

375
00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:21.583
This stuff's high fiber!

376
00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:23.708
Let's eat, let's eat…

377
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:26.291
Huh? Uh. Hmm.

378
00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:28.083
Hey! How come it's not moving?

379
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:30.833
Because, Şakir, this robot's frozen.
Poor thing.


380
00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:34.333
I'll make it some nice lemon mint tea,
then it'll feel all better.


381
00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:35.625
Mom, it's a robot.

382
00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:38.791
It can't drink any hot tea.
It's an alien robot.


383
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:41.833
Why isn't it working? 
I guess it's broken.

384
00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:44.166
What is this? USB input?

385
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.583
"USBI" input?

386
00:25:45.666 --> 00:25:48.466
Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to
charge my phone for a few minutes.


387
00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:50.375
Good, then. I'll plug it in now.

388
00:25:57.916 --> 00:25:59.875
Uh-uh. Whoa!

389
00:26:00.416 --> 00:26:01.625
Whoa!

390
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.083
Huh?

391
00:26:15.083 --> 00:26:16.083
Gotta go!

392
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.875
- Mirket?
- What?


393
00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:25.208
Is it you?

394
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:26.375
We finally found you!

395
00:26:26.458 --> 00:26:29.500
Well done. You found me. Yes.
A big round of applause.


396
00:26:29.583 --> 00:26:32.166
Look, I'm fine. Okay? Okay.
You can go now.


397
00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:35.875
What do you mean?

398
00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:39.125
We've been looking for you for a year,
and that's the first thing you say to us?


399
00:26:40.458 --> 00:26:43.875
Hey! I missed you so much, Remzi!

400
00:26:43.958 --> 00:26:47.541
I'm so glad you found me. Yippee!

401
00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:49.375
There, is that better? Now get out.

402
00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:51.250
Mirket, hug me too.

403
00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:54.541
Oh, my goodness.
What should I have done when I saw you?


404
00:26:54.625 --> 00:26:56.916
Bake a pie? Whip up cheese dip? Ugh!

405
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.208
Hey, if anyone's gonna make
some great dip, that'll be me.


406
00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:02.250
Canan, bring me
some of that grated cheese.


407
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:05.000
Wait a minute, Mirket.
You can't just get rid of us.


408
00:27:05.083 --> 00:27:08.041
We've got many Necatis. We couldn't deal
with one, now there's seven.


409
00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:10.375
Yummy, yummy, yeah, yeah!

410
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.875
Look, we brought this crazy device
that split him up.


411
00:27:14.958 --> 00:27:16.750
- It did a great job.
- Come on, Mirket.


412
00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:19.916
You can't keep hiding forever.
For one thing, you have to fix Necati.


413
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.541
Sorry. You came for nothing.

414
00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:24.625
I stopped using my brain
a long time ago, you see?


415
00:27:24.708 --> 00:27:25.833
Look.

416
00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:28.541
Hilarious! Now we're smarter than Mirket.

417
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.916
I threw away all my work and projects.
They're long gone.


418
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.583
And I don't remember a thing.

419
00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:39.500
The system is rebooting.

420
00:27:39.583 --> 00:27:42.791
Investigating environment.
The system is ready.


421
00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:43.875
ANALYSIS

422
00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:47.458
- Hey! The robot's working.
- Mr. Robot. So how are you, sir?


423
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:50.302
Hey you, do your parents know you're here?
Have you called them today?


424
00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:51.333
COMPUTING

425
00:27:51.416 --> 00:27:53.875
Ugh. Your clothes
have been ripped to shreds.


426
00:27:53.958 --> 00:27:56.208
Why did you go outside
in the freezing cold?


427
00:27:56.291 --> 00:27:57.916
Let me see, you might have a fever.

428
00:27:58.958 --> 00:28:00.458
Hey, guys. How's it going?

429
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:02.250
Welcome to my channel, robot.

430
00:28:02.333 --> 00:28:06.125
Okay, we're gonna do the robot dance.
Come on, show everyone.


431
00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:10.625
That's it!

432
00:28:10.708 --> 00:28:12.333
Your turn, robot.

433
00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:18.916
Estimated arrival time
is four minutes and 20 seconds.


434
00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:23.708
Arrival? What arrival? Who are you?
Where are we? What's going on?


435
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:25.333
Don't you have questions, guys?

436
00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:28.291
Mr. Robot,
is a wrap eaten with a single pita


437
00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:30.166
- or a double pita instead?
- Single.


438
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.875
How many times a day
is a broken watch correct?


439
00:28:32.958 --> 00:28:35.708
- Twice.
- But that's if the watch isn't wound up.


440
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:38.583
Of course, it could be a cuckoo clock!

441
00:28:38.666 --> 00:28:40.708
Would you excuse me for a moment?

442
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:43.708
Hello, Mr. Robot.
Please introduce yourself.


443
00:28:43.791 --> 00:28:46.500
My name is KRM-2.

444
00:28:46.583 --> 00:28:49.333
I was produced by the Galaxy Federation.

445
00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:53.083
And I was sent here to save your planet
from its doomed future.


446
00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:57.125
It is my duty to protect and defend you
against evil forces.


447
00:28:57.708 --> 00:29:00.208
Whoa, evil forces? Which ones?

448
00:29:00.291 --> 00:29:03.500
Nearly 100
of the garbage-filled rockets you fired


449
00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:06.708
traveled to a planet
where there are also forms of life.


450
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.666
Your rockets caused great destruction
and have all been grounded.


451
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.666
Because of the destruction,

452
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.416
these life forms have set out
to take revenge on you,


453
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.291
and they are about to arrive.

454
00:29:19.375 --> 00:29:23.875
Then, they will settle on your planet
and live here happily ever after.


455
00:29:23.958 --> 00:29:26.500
After they destroy all of you, of course.

456
00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:29.875
You stand very little chance of survival,
to put it nicely.


457
00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:31.750
You reap what you sow.

458
00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:33.250
It's like I told you.

459
00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:36.666
It was the biggest mistake we ever made
to send our trash to space.


460
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.666
They have sent one spaceship here
ahead of the others.


461
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.208
And the full fleet is positioned ready
to attack outside of Earth's atmosphere.


462
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:48.375
Well, we must stop them.
We can't let them take over our planet.


463
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:51.000
Their weaponry is far too advanced

464
00:29:51.083 --> 00:29:53.833
for you powerless earthlings
to survive at all.


465
00:29:53.916 --> 00:29:57.000
- You have zero chance.
- Wow, that bad?


466
00:29:57.083 --> 00:30:00.125
I am the only
thing that can stop them.

467
00:30:00.208 --> 00:30:03.250
That is why they are trying so hard
to destroy me.


468
00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:05.958
Yum!

469
00:30:06.541 --> 00:30:08.916
No, Necati! No! No biting. Stop it!

470
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.708
Time is running out. We must go to
the Space Agency right now.


471
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:15.750
I have to hack my way
into the computer system


472
00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:18.291
and connect to your rockets
that you sent to space


473
00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:20.500
so I can use them against the aliens.

474
00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:23.291
To defeat them,
we must use every available option.


475
00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:25.625
Mirket, do you know
where the Space Agency is?


476
00:30:25.708 --> 00:30:28.083
Or the circle of space
or whatever they call it?


477
00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:31.625
I beg your pardon? What'd you say?
I can't hear you.


478
00:30:31.708 --> 00:30:34.958
My brain can't hear things anymore.
So sorry.


479
00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:36.041
Come on, Mirket.

480
00:30:36.125 --> 00:30:39.291
You can't stop trying because some
of your inventions didn't work.


481
00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:40.958
Inventors don't give up.

482
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:43.750
What? Where are you, Canan?

483
00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:45.958
My brain can't even
see you. Are you here?

484
00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:49.125
Mirket clearly won't help.

485
00:30:49.208 --> 00:30:51.625
In that case,
we'll have to handle all this ourselves.


486
00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:53.708
Mmm… Wait, I found it!

487
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:55.916
There's an airport 35 miles away.

488
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.500
If we get there, we can find a plane
to take us to the Space Agency.


489
00:30:59.583 --> 00:31:02.458
Creating a route to
get us to the airport.

490
00:31:02.541 --> 00:31:05.333
Fantastic! So you've created your route.

491
00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:07.583
Oh, my! And the weather has improved too.

492
00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:09.416
You can leave now. Everyone out!

493
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.583
Go on, move it! Get out!

494
00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:14.625
Take your bags and little Necatis
and get out of here!


495
00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:17.875
Hide and seek!

496
00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:24.041
Shoo! Go! I came to the other side
of the world to be alone,


497
00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:27.208
and yet still,
you decide to come and find me, huh?


498
00:31:27.291 --> 00:31:30.041
It's unbelievable, really. Goodbye!

499
00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:33.250
Mirket, you open this door!

500
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:34.708
You have to fix Necati!

501
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.250
Okay, guys, guess what?
I think we have a major problem.


502
00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:45.000
Huh? Oh! What's that?

503
00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:53.583
I've got a bad feeling about this.

504
00:31:53.666 --> 00:31:56.625
Same here.
That wood I ate is giving me bad gas.


505
00:31:56.708 --> 00:31:59.458
Mirket, open up! 
These aliens are coming!

506
00:31:59.541 --> 00:32:03.541
Oh, you see aliens? Of course you do.
But my brain can't hear you!


507
00:32:03.625 --> 00:32:06.791
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪


508
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:13.041
Hide! Now!

509
00:32:13.125 --> 00:32:14.541
Oh!

510
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:23.458
- Do you believe me now, Mirket?
- Your butt's on fire!


511
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.625
Put it out! Put
it out! Put it out!

512
00:32:26.708 --> 00:32:28.875
Not with a stick!

513
00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:32.166
Not with a stick!
Ow! Not with a stick!


514
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.250
Come on, we gotta go!

515
00:32:34.875 --> 00:32:37.500
- Oh! Oh!
- Go where?


516
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.333
Here! Get on! Jump.

517
00:33:18.208 --> 00:33:21.500
Hey! Oh, boy. Hang on tight,
we're going through those two rocks!


518
00:33:23.708 --> 00:33:26.208
Mirket, hold on!
How do you know we'll fit through?


519
00:33:36.208 --> 00:33:39.000
Canan, slow down.
Signal when changing lanes!


520
00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:41.666
Mom! Don't distract me! Please!

521
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.750
Did you check the oil
and wiper fluid before we left?


522
00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:48.500
- Huh?
- Ah! Hello, Kadriye.


523
00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:50.291
Remzi, what are you doing?

524
00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:54.250
Just rolling along.

525
00:34:12.791 --> 00:34:15.958
Remzi, what are you doing?
Let go of me!


526
00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:18.541
Welcome to my channel, 
Necati lovers!

527
00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:21.000
Snowball fight! 
Ready for action!

528
00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:22.750
Give it to me. I'll eat it.

529
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:30.333
Remzi, will you let go already?

530
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.333
Uh-oh.

531
00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:50.333
Mirket, watch out! Behind you!

532
00:34:51.166 --> 00:34:52.791
Mirket, hold on! 
You've got trouble!

533
00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:56.166
What? Is is a flat tire?
Is the stove on? What is it?


534
00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.583
- Oh!
- Oh!


535
00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:10.166
Oh, yes! A cave! 
We'll lose them.

536
00:35:11.208 --> 00:35:13.833
Wow, these aliens are really persistent.

537
00:35:13.916 --> 00:35:16.791
Icicles ahead. 
Icicles ahead.

538
00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:18.583
Well, it's worth a try.

539
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:29.541
Aha! We did it!

540
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.791
Get out of here.

541
00:35:40.166 --> 00:35:43.166
Remzi, if you could sit still,
I would appreciate it!


542
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.666
You're a fine one to talk!
You have no idea what I just went through.


543
00:35:49.666 --> 00:35:52.416
Huh? The brakes are bad,
and the throttle's stuck!


544
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.041
What are we going to do?

545
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:58.041
Canan! Their throttle's stuck.
We gotta do something!


546
00:35:58.125 --> 00:36:01.541
The probability of saving them is 9%.

547
00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:03.666
The risk is too high. Negative.

548
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.083
Hey, they're my family!

549
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:11.291
Jump on. We don't have much time!

550
00:36:11.875 --> 00:36:14.208
- Go on. You go first.
- Here goes!


551
00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:21.541
Huh? What's that?

552
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:24.625
It's the end of the road.

553
00:36:24.708 --> 00:36:26.416
Şakir, stop!

554
00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:28.250
Huh?

555
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.125
It's frozen.
The lake's frozen over.


556
00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:50.666
Ah! Get some perspective.

557
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.791
At least we've managed to come this far
without any…


558
00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:56.541
…accidents!

559
00:36:56.625 --> 00:36:59.166
No one move even an inch!

560
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.000
So I shouldn't be break-dancing?
Is that right?


561
00:37:02.083 --> 00:37:03.416
Of course you shouldn't!

562
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.125
Now, everybody move
as slowly as possible towards the shore.


563
00:37:07.708 --> 00:37:10.291
Kadriye? Where is Kadriye?

564
00:37:10.375 --> 00:37:14.500
- Remzi, I'm over here!
- Kadriye, don't move a muscle!


565
00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:17.541
- And don't break-dance either!
- Huh? What?


566
00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:19.291
Mom, don't move!

567
00:37:22.875 --> 00:37:24.666
They are here. 
They are here!

568
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.041
Oh, no. What do we do?

569
00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:35.666
My coat. Oh no, it's stuck.

570
00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:40.125
We have to save Kadriye.

571
00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:42.875
Whoa! Dad, stop!

572
00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:45.125
We have to get to shore right away.

573
00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:47.291
Mom! We can't just leave her there.

574
00:37:47.375 --> 00:37:49.875
Pressure, time and square feet
are calculated.


575
00:37:49.958 --> 00:37:53.500
There are approximately 15 seconds
until this ice will collapse.


576
00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:54.916
We must go.

577
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.750
Oh, no. They're getting closer.

578
00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:07.291
Necatis!

579
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.500
Necatis!

580
00:38:58.333 --> 00:39:00.375
Whoa, what are they doing?

581
00:39:06.458 --> 00:39:08.708
I'm not sure,
but I think they're saving Mom.


582
00:39:08.791 --> 00:39:13.416
Negative. They're not saving your mother.
They are in fact kidnapping her.


583
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.416
They will do anything
they can to stop us.

584
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.041
What are we waiting for?
We have to go save her right now!


585
00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:23.625
There is a 0% probability of saving
your mother by engaging the spaceship.


586
00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:26.458
- It would be illogical...
- But we can't leave my mom behind!


587
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:28.666
Take me to the Space Agency.

588
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.875
I have a 9% chance of stopping them
that way.


589
00:39:31.958 --> 00:39:35.666
Under these dire circumstances,
this is the only course of action.


590
00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:44.250
Oh, no! It's coming towards us!

591
00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:45.375
- Over here.
- Huh?


592
00:39:45.458 --> 00:39:46.666
Huh?

593
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.750
It's a cover.

594
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:50.666
It's gotta open...

595
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.958
Come on, everyone. Follow me!

596
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.583
Be careful, but hurry.
Let's not waste time!


597
00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:12.291
Where are we? What is this place?

598
00:40:12.375 --> 00:40:15.041
I don't know.
Just walk, keep going. In here.


599
00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:18.791
It's really dark.

600
00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:22.166
Yeah, I'll see if I can find a light
somewhere. There's a lever.


601
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.000
- I'll pull it.
- Argh! That was my arm, idiot!


602
00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:26.458
Whoops.

603
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:32.041
Hey!

604
00:40:32.125 --> 00:40:33.500
Don't be scared. It's just me.

605
00:40:33.583 --> 00:40:35.708
It's this really cool mask.
I just found it here.


606
00:40:35.791 --> 00:40:37.500
Well, it looks very old.

607
00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:40.916
This place must be an old army bunker,
am I right?


608
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.791
Don't look at me, Canan.

609
00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:46.875
My brain doesn't work anymore.

610
00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:49.666
Hello? Who's that? 
Mirket speaking.

611
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.125
Okay, I think that this time
I found the right lever.


612
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:57.541
Hmm. Wow, interesting.

613
00:40:57.625 --> 00:40:59.458
Incredible.

614
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:03.875
To me, it looks pretty ordinary.

615
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.791
A radio!

616
00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:08.541
Hello? Hello?

617
00:41:08.625 --> 00:41:10.416
No, it's not working.

618
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.791
Hmm? What's this?

619
00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:14.583
This is a telegraph machine.

620
00:41:14.666 --> 00:41:17.291
You can use it
to send messages in Morse code.


621
00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:20.000
If it still works,
we can ask someone for help.


622
00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:23.375
Hello. Stop. We are very hungry. Stop.

623
00:41:23.458 --> 00:41:26.583
Send six cheese sandwiches.
Six chocolate milkshakes. Stop.


624
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.541
Uh, sir.
Someone sent an emergency message.


625
00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:37.291
"Six cheese sandwiches
and six chocolate milkshakes."


626
00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:40.333
Hmm. The milkshakes: chocolate or vanilla?

627
00:41:40.416 --> 00:41:42.708
- Chocolate, sir.
- Mm-hmm.


628
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:44.541
Allow me.

629
00:41:44.625 --> 00:41:47.166
Hello. Evil aliens have arrived.

630
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.500
Come and help us. Stop.

631
00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:53.291
One kebab special. Pick up.

632
00:41:53.375 --> 00:41:55.750
Chef! Chef! A new order has arrived.

633
00:41:55.833 --> 00:41:58.750
It says, uh,
"Aliens have arrived. Come and help us."


634
00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:02.916
- Hmm. So are aliens good or bad?
- They're bad.


635
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.416
Mm-hmm…

636
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:08.583
We're wasting our time here.

637
00:42:10.916 --> 00:42:12.500
What the heck was that?

638
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.666
- The aliens!
- Where?


639
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:22.583
Estimated time for the aliens' arrival
is exactly three minutes and 30 seconds.


640
00:42:22.666 --> 00:42:25.208
That submarine! 
We'll escape in the sub.

641
00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:27.750
Come on. Everybody in. Quick, quick!

642
00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:29.333
Okay, I'm jumping in!

643
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.166
What are you doing?
He said the submarine, not in the water!


644
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.416
Oh!

645
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.833
I thought Şakir meant
"to go under the water."


646
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:49.166
Evacuate quickly. 
Evacuate quickly.

647
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.916
Evacuate quickly. 
Evacuate quickly.

648
00:42:55.916 --> 00:42:58.041
So who here can steer a submarine?

649
00:42:58.125 --> 00:43:01.125
It's quite easy, dear.
We steer using this thing.


650
00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:05.916
- It's not working...
- Because it's a life preserver!


651
00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:20.375
Yeah!

652
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:56.291
Oh, no. The exit to the tunnel
is closed off.


653
00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:58.000
So then how do we get out?

654
00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:18.500
We did it!

655
00:44:18.583 --> 00:44:20.125
- All right!
- We sure did!


656
00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:23.291

We won't leave your mother behind.
We are going to save her.


678
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.958
How can we save her
by running away from them?


679
00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:38.750
We're wasting precious time now.

680
00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:25.250
- I can't believe my eyes!
- What do you mean?


681
00:47:25.833 --> 00:47:28.500
Mirket, what's happening?
Is it a new adventure?


682
00:47:28.583 --> 00:47:31.750
Fireball-throwing ninja dinosaurs
or laser-firing one-eyed vampires?


683
00:47:34.125 --> 00:47:35.958
I'm afraid it's even worse.

684
00:47:49.791 --> 00:47:51.333
I don't believe it.

685
00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:53.958
Didn't...

686
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:56.958
Didn't we send all of this garbage
into space?


687
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:59.916
That was supposed
to make the world cleaner.


688
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.208
Just look! If only my stupid invention
had worked back then.


689
00:48:04.291 --> 00:48:06.625
I could have gotten rid of
all this garbage.


690
00:48:06.708 --> 00:48:10.333
Determining the optimum route
to get us to the airport.


691
00:48:10.416 --> 00:48:13.125
Are you seeing this?
Those cowards lied to us!


692
00:48:13.208 --> 00:48:17.291
The world is far from being clean,
and you still want to go to the airport?


693
00:48:17.375 --> 00:48:20.625
We must now get moving,
or your world will not just be filthy,


694
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:23.583
it will actually be completely destroyed.

695
00:48:23.666 --> 00:48:24.916
Ruined forever.

696
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.375
If that happens, you will not even have
a planet to call filthy anymore.


697
00:48:29.458 --> 00:48:32.875
The route has been created.
Let us proceed north.


698
00:48:43.291 --> 00:48:45.750
Huh? Did you guys see that?

699
00:48:45.833 --> 00:48:48.208
That garbage can just moved.

700
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.208
Negative. No life form whatsoever
is detected.


701
00:49:00.291 --> 00:49:02.416
Oh, I must have imagined it.

702
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.125
We all deserve it!

703
00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:08.750
We all deserve it! 
We all deserve it!

704
00:49:08.833 --> 00:49:11.250
We all deserve it! 
We all deserve it!

705
00:49:11.333 --> 00:49:12.958
What are they saying?

706
00:49:13.041 --> 00:49:16.375
You say weeds deserved it?
Why would weeds deserve it?


707
00:49:16.458 --> 00:49:19.208
Not "weeds."
They're saying, "We deserved it."


708
00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:22.125
We all deserve it! 
We all deserve it!

709
00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:24.916
We all deserve it! 
We all deserve it!

710
00:49:29.208 --> 00:49:31.625
Look, my friends.
Their father is here too.


711
00:49:32.291 --> 00:49:35.416
You are lost in very dirty lands,

712
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.125
where all of us exist in total isolation.

713
00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:43.250
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-how?
- What happened to this place?


714
00:49:43.333 --> 00:49:46.041
They said that there was no garbage left
in the whole world...


715
00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:48.875
We all deserve it! 
We all deserve it!

716
00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:51.625
We all deserve it! 
We all deserve it!

717
00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:54.708
But no one ever keeps their word.

718
00:49:55.708 --> 00:49:57.708
We haven't learned from our mistakes.

719
00:49:58.291 --> 00:50:01.750
No. We seek help from outer space instead.

720
00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:04.083
This wise man shines like a star!

721
00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:07.291
Thank you, wise man,
for explaining it so well!


722
00:50:07.375 --> 00:50:08.375
Uh, what did he say?

723
00:50:08.458 --> 00:50:11.041
Wise One,
could you please explain it simply?


724
00:50:11.125 --> 00:50:12.625

744
00:51:05.666 --> 00:51:07.750
You should put this song on the Internet!

00:51:07.833 --> 00:51:10.166
You'd get a million hits, easily.

746
00:51:10.666 --> 00:51:14.833
The higher-ups think we're saved
because we're sending garbage into space.


747
00:51:14.916 --> 00:51:16.208
But it's made it worse.

748
00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:18.583
Now we're polluting the environment
without thinking,


749
00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:20.500
and we're not even worried about it

750
00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:23.041
because we'll just keep shooting it
into space!


751
00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:26.291
You are right.
That is exactly what you are doing.


752
00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:28.666
Hey, guys. The airport sign.

753
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.000
AIRPORT

754
00:51:30.083 --> 00:51:31.500
Let's go.

755
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.375
Where are we, in an airport junkyard?

756
00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:01.750
All the planes are damaged
as if someone bombed them.


757
00:52:01.833 --> 00:52:04.833
I'm not sure we'll find anything
that we can use here.


758
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:10.750
Huh? Wait a minute. What's this?

759
00:52:10.833 --> 00:52:12.041
What's what?

760
00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:15.541
This.

761
00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:18.166
That is a tracking device.

762
00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.250
- What? What do you mean?
- Calculating.


763
00:52:21.333 --> 00:52:24.750
The time before they arrive
is approximately one hour,


764
00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:26.125
if we are lucky.

765
00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:28.750
Then we need to get
out of here right now.

766
00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:31.041
I wish one of these planes worked.

767
00:52:32.416 --> 00:52:34.250
It is worth trying.

768
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:42.916
Scanning in progress.

769
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
70% of parts are functional.

770
00:52:46.083 --> 00:52:48.291
This plane is the least damaged.

771
00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:52.583
Time required to assemble parts
is 17… hours.


772
00:52:52.666 --> 00:52:53.833
17 hours?

773
00:52:53.916 --> 00:52:57.041
The aliens will have already found us
and tore us apart by then.


774
00:52:57.125 --> 00:52:58.458
I have a question.

775
00:52:58.541 --> 00:53:01.458
Your invention
broke the garbage into pieces.


776
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:04.125
Can we reverse it
so that it can put things together


777
00:53:04.208 --> 00:53:05.208
and make them whole?

778
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:07.875
We can certainly use that function
to our advantage.


779
00:53:07.958 --> 00:53:08.958
I don't know.

780
00:53:09.041 --> 00:53:11.791
Like I said, I trashed all my projects
a year ago.


781
00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:13.250
I don't remember anything.

782
00:53:20.583 --> 00:53:22.000
But I can do it.

783
00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.750
This is test one.

784
00:53:39.791 --> 00:53:43.208
Test one failed.
A new solution must be produced.


785
00:53:47.541 --> 00:53:48.958
Test two.

786
00:53:51.833 --> 00:53:55.291
Test two failed.
A new solution must be produced.


787
00:53:55.375 --> 00:53:58.375
Hey, hold on. What if we don't
get this done by the time they arrive?


788
00:53:58.458 --> 00:53:59.458
What then?

789
00:53:59.541 --> 00:54:01.541
We will resist! 
We will fight!

790
00:54:01.625 --> 00:54:04.375
We will do our best
for the safety of the whole world!


791
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:06.708
If we have to, we'll eat salmon kebab!

792
00:54:07.208 --> 00:54:09.041
Since they're on their way to stop us,

793
00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:11.958
then let's teach them a lesson
they'll never ever forget.


794
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:14.416
I can teach chemistry and physics,
if need be.


795
00:54:17.666 --> 00:54:18.875
Test three.

796
00:54:21.208 --> 00:54:23.458
Test three fails, like the others.

797
00:54:23.541 --> 00:54:25.375
What caused the failure?

798
00:54:25.916 --> 00:54:28.791
Failure is currently being investigated.

799
00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:31.875
Failure is a choice, most of the time.

800
00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:34.791
Not giving up is the real success.

801
00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:36.708
Those words...

802
00:54:36.791 --> 00:54:39.166
Yes, that's right. 
They're Mirket's words.

803
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.333
Hey, Mirket. Do you remember?

804
00:54:41.416 --> 00:54:44.208
I couldn't do a backflip in gym class
years ago.


805
00:54:44.291 --> 00:54:46.958
I tried and tried a thousand times
but failed.


806
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:49.708
Then you saw me at the gym
and gave me a pep talk.


807
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:51.833
And you said those exact words.

808
00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:53.458
And what happened then?

809
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:56.541
I didn't give up, trying for hours.

810
00:54:56.625 --> 00:55:00.500
After a few days, I was able to do
as many backflips as I wanted to do.


811
00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:04.375
Can I ask you to say those words
one more time, please?


812
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.583
Hmm? Mm-hmm.

813
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:49.041
Test 63.

814
00:56:28.875 --> 00:56:32.416
- It worked!
- That's it! We did it!


815
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.416
You're a genius!

816
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:38.458
Yeah! It worked! It worked!
It worked, it worked, it worked!


817
00:56:38.541 --> 00:56:42.125
Uh, where are the little Necatis?
Just where'd they go?


818
00:56:42.208 --> 00:56:43.750
- Huh?
- Yeah, where'd they go?


819
00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.375
Where are they?

820
00:56:47.416 --> 00:56:49.375
Did someone call me?

821
00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:51.750
- Huh?
- Necati, it's you!


822
00:56:51.833 --> 00:56:53.500
- You're back!
- Yippee!


823
00:56:53.583 --> 00:56:55.666
You pulled yourself together!

824
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:59.166
The most popular character
in the world is finally back.


825
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:01.041
Back-a-show-me-wow-wow!

826
00:57:04.666 --> 00:57:07.916
I hope you've learned
never to mess with my inventions.


827
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.708
And Mirket,
I hope you won't give up ever again.


828
00:57:10.791 --> 00:57:12.916
You can be sure of that, Şakir.

829
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.666
I will never give up again.

830
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:17.791
No! When I separated the garbage on the TV
that day...


831
00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:21.458
Huh? "When I separated"? Wait a sec.
What'd I say?


832
00:57:21.541 --> 00:57:24.041
I said, "When I separated the garbage…"

833
00:57:24.125 --> 00:57:26.250
When I separated the garbage!

834
00:57:26.333 --> 00:57:28.916
- Eureka! I found it!
- What did you find?


835
00:57:29.416 --> 00:57:32.833
My invention works!
My invention never failed at all.


836
00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:35.125
It works! It can be used for garbage.

837
00:57:35.208 --> 00:57:37.708
Yes, but your device
disassembles and assembles it.


838
00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:42.125
- So how would that be useful for garbage?
- No, that's not it. It's not that simple.


839
00:57:42.666 --> 00:57:45.125
This device does not only
shred the garbage,


840
00:57:45.208 --> 00:57:47.208
it totally separates the garbage.

841
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:50.583
Watch this. I'm going to use my invention
on this trash.


842
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.708
Do you see now?

843
00:57:57.791 --> 00:58:01.333
Glass, metal, plastic and organic.

844
00:58:01.416 --> 00:58:03.333
It separated the garbage by type.

845
00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:05.875
That's true!

846
00:58:05.958 --> 00:58:10.125
This represents a revolutionary step
for recycling technology.


847
00:58:10.208 --> 00:58:13.708
I did it! An unprecedented invention!

848
00:58:13.791 --> 00:58:17.833
According to my calculations, we have

849
00:58:17.916 --> 00:58:21.041
Mirket, you can celebrate later.
We need to get out of here now.


850
00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:25.125
Okay, okay. The plane is in one piece,
but we need to refuel it now.


851
00:58:25.208 --> 00:58:29.708
Remzi, Canan? Come with me.
There must be fuel somewhere around here.


852
00:58:29.791 --> 00:58:31.250
Uh-huh.

853
00:58:31.333 --> 00:58:34.041
Şakir, I will help you
to stop the aliens.


854
00:58:34.125 --> 00:58:36.750
I know what to do. Come with me.

855
00:58:36.833 --> 00:58:40.041
Well, I'm joining the aliens.
'Cause they're way stronger.


856
00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:43.083
No, you're not, Necati. Come with me.
You're gonna help us.


857
00:58:43.166 --> 00:58:46.375
Hey, if we lose,
I don't know you. We're strangers.


858
00:58:46.458 --> 00:58:50.666
In fact, I don't even know you now.
Ugh, who are you? Let go of me!


859
00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.750
We got this!

860
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.291
Wow! This is so great!

861
01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:27.750
Ha!

862
01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:31.166
This is awesome!

863
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.250
- Hyah!
- Huh?


864
01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:41.625
- Şakir!
- Wow, my son's become a superhero.


865
01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.458
Just like his father.

866
01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:48.166
This is crazy!

867
01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:53.041
Very well done, chief.
You did a really good job.


868
01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:56.791
Uh, wait. Where's Necati...

869
01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:59.125
Super Necati is coming!

870
01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:02.000
Whoa!

871
01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:06.416
He made it himself. 
I had no input.

872
01:01:06.916 --> 01:01:10.583
I fly like an elephant,
and I scatter honey like a bee!


873
01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.916
Oh, my!

874
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.333
What's going on?

875
01:01:14.416 --> 01:01:16.333
It's out of gas!

876
01:01:17.916 --> 01:01:20.666
Can you call my lawyer?
I think I've got a case.


877
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.333
Huh? Hey, what's that sound?

878
01:01:27.666 --> 01:01:29.875
They have arrived. 
They have arrived!

879
01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:32.708
- Is the plane ready?
- It still needs a little work.


880
01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:35.333
I can take care of it
if you can buy me some time.


881
01:01:35.416 --> 01:01:38.208
You got it!
We're ready, let's get started!


882
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:41.500
We are ready!

883
01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:36.333
Okay, guys. This plane's ready to go.

884
01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:39.791
- You're amazing, Mirket!
- But the wings on it aren't very sturdy.


885
01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.625
Be very careful
during takeoff and landing.


886
01:03:46.041 --> 01:03:47.875
Alert: sonic bomb!

887
01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:49.416
- What?
- Oh, no!


888
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.208
Huh? Our way to escape's been destroyed.

889
01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:04.041
If only we had had a little more time,
then this never would have happened.


890
01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:17.000
You should never make
an elephant janitor mad.


891
01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:22.250
Because he never… forgets!

892
01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:24.125
Bucket hit!

893
01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:26.166
Pail power!

894
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:28.583
Broom attack! Broom boom!

895
01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:34.500
Super soap power! In your face!

896
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.250
There's a spacecraft over there.

897
01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:42.916
If we take it,
we can go to the Space Agency.


898
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.041
According to analytics, besides me,

899
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:48.208
I've determined who the smartest person
in your group is.


900
01:04:48.291 --> 01:04:50.916
- Thank you, my robot.
- Uh...


901
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.083
- He means me.
- Canan.


902
01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:54.875
We gotta save Kadriye.

903
01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:57.208
So you have to get us
on that spaceship first.


904
01:04:57.291 --> 01:04:59.875
Just drop me off
at the nearest donut shop.


905
01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:01.000
Okay, come on, then!

906
01:05:01.083 --> 01:05:03.291
Oh…

907
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:06.000
Powerful Earth Warriors!

908
01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:18.041
I'll stall them. 
You go to the ship.

909
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:21.875
- To the ship. Now boarding…
- I'm ready to rumble!


910
01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:28.041
Hey! Captain!

911
01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:30.791
Does this fly by The Grand Bazaar?

912
01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.083
OH, MY!

913
01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:34.208
Uh-oh!

914
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.208
Janitor power!

915
01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:42.000
Let me sweep this up.

916
01:05:42.083 --> 01:05:44.416
Clean up on Lane 2!

917
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.958
Nice work, Necati.
We'd better get moving!


918
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:51.416
Taking off. Hold on tight.

919
01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:13.333
Huh?

920
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.750
Hmm…

921
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:34.208
All right! We've docked with the ship.

922
01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:37.750
I will jump first, my friend.
How about a goodbye kiss?


923
01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:39.708
Don't be silly. 
We'll jump together.

924
01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:43.250
Oh, really? Then let's say something
when we jump out.


925
01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:46.125
- What shall we say?
- The first thing that comes to mind.


926
01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:47.541
Let's see what happens.

927
01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:49.625
- So, are you ready?
- Okay.


928
01:06:49.708 --> 01:06:53.041
One, two, three.

929
01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:56.916
Mashed potatoes!

930
01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.666
This is true friendship, Remzi!

931
01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:02.166
We're thinking the same thing
at the same time.


932
01:07:02.666 --> 01:07:04.833
I agree!

933
01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:08.083
Are these two always like that?

934
01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:09.375
That's a yes.

935
01:07:13.666 --> 01:07:15.958
Whoa!

936
01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:07.541
Huh?

937
01:08:18.708 --> 01:08:21.458
Necati, do you hear what I'm hearing?

938
01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:23.708
Massage music is playing, Remzi.

939
01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:26.000
I guess we've come
to a very expensive place.


940
01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:27.916
This place is way too fancy.

941
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.708
This ship is so big
that it probably has a spa in it.


942
01:08:34.541 --> 01:08:36.750
Oh, we found it!

943
01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:54.750
This spa's gotta have a sauna.

944
01:08:54.833 --> 01:08:57.083
- Let's work up a sweat and leave.
- No!


945
01:08:58.041 --> 01:08:59.708
Oh! Look at this.

946
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:02.666
Wait a sec. That's Kadriye's coat.

947
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.416
Who knows what experiments
they did to Kadriye?


948
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
I hope that we're not too late.

949
01:09:07.583 --> 01:09:08.708
Necati?

950
01:09:08.791 --> 01:09:11.458
Kadriye? What did they do to you?

951
01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:15.916
- You have the same hair.
- But what happened to you?


952
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.083
Necati,
that's a broom that you're holding.


953
01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:20.625
Leave it. Come on,
we gotta get out of this place.


954
01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:22.250
But be very careful.

955
01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:25.000
We've gotta past these aliens
without waking anyone up.


956
01:09:25.083 --> 01:09:28.541
Okay, all right.
And then we can make a stop at the buffet.


957
01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:32.041
Necati, you're still banned from
all-you-can-eat buffets. You know that.


958
01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:36.333
So the buffet is all-you-can-eat,
but it's a "no-you-can't-eat" to Necati!


959
01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:39.625
Necati, you bankrupted three hotels
because you ate all of their food.


960
01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:42.958
The tourists had nothing to eat!
Don't make me yell. Walk quietly.


961
01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:47.416
Huh? Sorry, don't mind me, sir.

962
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.708
Hmm?

963
01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:54.916
I'm being very slow and careful. Oh!

964
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.291
You can do it. 
Just a little further.

965
01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:01.250
Yes.

966
01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:03.416
We're almost there.

967
01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:10.041
Ah!

968
01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:14.833
For a moment there,
I didn't think I was gonna make it.


969
01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:43.458
Huh?

970
01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:48.541
Hey! Is this a surprise party?

971
01:10:55.666 --> 01:10:58.041
How long until we reach the space center?

972
01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:00.083
Calculating. ETA, three minutes.

973
01:11:00.166 --> 01:11:02.583
Three? We won't even last a minute
at this rate.


974
01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:14.125
Oh! Şakir!

975
01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:19.458
That's the last one.

976
01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:24.208
Şakir Airlines wishes you a safe,
wonderful flight.


977
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.958
Come on. Let's go find the control room.

978
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:47.500
Remzi, what do you think
they'll do to us now?


979
01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:51.291
They'll eat us like kebabs.
Or even worse, fry us like chicken.


980
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:55.375
When you put it that way,
I'm not afraid. But I feel hungrier.


981
01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:58.541
Necati, calm down. 
We're in this together.

982
01:11:58.625 --> 01:11:59.916
- Remzi, buddy.
- Hmm?


983
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.041
How about a hug?

984
01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:17.458
Hey, look, Remzi.
These aliens picnic just like we do.


985
01:12:31.708 --> 01:12:34.166
Dungangi bunga, "Have a nice day."

986
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.083
Dungangi bunga, "Have a nice day."

987
01:12:36.166 --> 01:12:37.166
Repeat now.

988
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.916
Have a nice day!

989
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.375
Hmm… Takuntaa? "What's up, bro?"
"What's up, bro?"


990
01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.833
- Let's repeat now.
- What's up, bro?


991
01:12:44.916 --> 01:12:47.291
Very nice.
All right, that's enough for today.


992
01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:50.166
Tomorrow, we'll learn
how to apply for a loan. How about that?


993
01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:54.375
Kadriye! Are you all right?

994
01:12:54.958 --> 01:12:58.625
- Did they do any weird experiments on you?
- Excuse me? And you are?


995
01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.666
Kadriye, I'm Remzi, your husband.

996
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.625
Look, this is Necati.
You and I have two children together.


997
01:13:04.208 --> 01:13:06.083
Huh? I don't recall that.

998
01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:09.750
Oh, no! I guess when Kadriye
fell through the ice, her head froze.


999
01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.666
She doesn't remember us!

1000
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:16.125
Argh! Boys, go play with your ball
somewhere else.


1001
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.291
Didn't I tell you already? Come on!

1002
01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:20.208
Hey! Remzi! Necati!

1003
01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:22.250
Now I remember you!

1004
01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:24.083
Kadriye, it's you!

1005
01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.125
Thanks so much, guys.
Your kick reset my lady...


1006
01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:29.541
So, Remzi, where are Şakir and Canan?

1007
01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:32.291
They're headed to the space center
with a robot and Mirket.


1008
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:34.500
But these aliens are trying to stop them.

1009
01:13:34.583 --> 01:13:36.708
These are bad aliens, Kadriye. Really bad!

1010
01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:39.291
Uh-uh! I've never seen them
being bad, Remzi.


1011
01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:41.375
They've only been super nice to me.

1012
01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:43.875
Hmm. Interesting. 
So you say they're nice.

1013
01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:46.041
Wow. I never thought of that.

1014
01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:49.250
Hey! Hey, earthlings!

1015
01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:52.333
Oh. Remzi, look, this is their commander.

1016
01:13:52.416 --> 01:13:54.500
Really?

1017
01:13:55.958 --> 01:13:58.708
Why in the world
did you kiss that alien's hand, Remzi?


1018
01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:01.666
I don't know, Kadriye. 
I was excited!

1019
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:04.041
Why don't you ask
for a picnic table for two?


1020
01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:07.791
No. Come with me,
and I will explain everything to you.


1021
01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:16.250
Perfect. Now we'll get it done.

1022
01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:19.583
Success.
I have logged into the rockets' network.


1023
01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:21.500
Everything is ready.

1024
01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:26.833
Those big trash rockets
you sent from your planet a year ago


1025
01:14:26.916 --> 01:14:30.083
went everywhere, scattered all over space.

1026
01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:34.708
And your garbage landed on us
and hundreds of other planets.


1027
01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:38.583
At that time, while we were looking for
the source of the garbage,


1028
01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:39.916
we noticed this.

1029
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.708
The debris from a rocket
that crashed on the planet Terra X


1030
01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:46.208
combined with an organism
already dumped there.


1031
01:14:46.291 --> 01:14:49.875
The artificial intelligence card
inside that organism was activated,


1032
01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:53.125
and the robot named KRM came to life.

1033
01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:56.000
But… isn't that our robot?

1034
01:14:56.083 --> 01:14:58.875
This robot has only one mission.

1035
01:14:58.958 --> 01:15:02.708
And that is to take revenge on you
and your planet.


1036
01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:04.125
What? Don't look at me.

1037
01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.958
This has nothing to do with Necati.
I'm just here for the food!


1038
01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:10.500
He tried to reach your planet
on a spaceship he stole from us.


1039
01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:12.875
So we followed him from a distance.

1040
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:15.333
And then we were able
to catch up with him.


1041
01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:17.208
We've been trying to stop him ever since.

1042
01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:19.875
So… that means…

1043
01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:22.250
you aliens were never actually
the bad guys.


1044
01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:24.708
The real bad guy is…

1045
01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:33.208
EARTH
ACCESS GAINED


1046
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.500
What?

1047
01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:39.875
Wait, the world's a target?

1048
01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:41.916
Why'd you type that?

1049
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.041
I did it because now…

1050
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:46.125
is the time for revenge!

1051
01:15:47.666 --> 01:15:49.166
Don't be silly. Let me go!

1052
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:51.458
- Bye!
- Ah!


1053
01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:54.041
Hey!

1054
01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:57.041
Mirket launched me into space.

1055
01:15:57.125 --> 01:16:00.666
He threw me away like trash
with other garbage and pieces of junk.


1056
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:02.833
I was left to die alone.

1057
01:16:02.916 --> 01:16:05.833
Completely alone, in outer space.

1058
01:16:05.916 --> 01:16:09.166
Do you know how terrible that was
for me to end up there?


1059
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:13.166
And now, it's finally time
for some well-deserved revenge!


1060
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:17.125
I will gather all of the garbage you have
sent to space in the last 12 months,


1061
01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.458
all those thousands of rockets.

1062
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:22.541
And… I will throw
it on top of you!

1063
01:16:23.041 --> 01:16:27.125
Your world will be a worse place
than it ever was before.


1064
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:31.166
You will suffer a slow death
in the garbage!


1065
01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:34.083
You humans deserve that fate.

1066
01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:36.041
It can't be! You…

1067
01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:39.458
You're Artificial Intelligence 4914!

1068
01:16:40.041 --> 01:16:41.500
Good night, Mirket.

1069
01:16:41.583 --> 01:16:43.250
Good morning, Mirket.

1070
01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:46.500
Do you want me to give you a cookie,
Professor Mirket?


1071
01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:51.250
I created you.

1072
01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:54.583
So why are you...
Why would you do this to all of us?


1073
01:16:54.666 --> 01:16:58.250
Because you created me.
Then you tossed me away.


1074
01:16:58.333 --> 01:17:01.833
Now you will pay for what you did.
You reap what you sow.


1075
01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:03.791
The operation has started.

1076
01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:05.750
The operation has started.

1077
01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:08.791
THE OPERATION HAS STARTED

1078
01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:42.916
Your hero Şakir has returned.
How are you doing?


1079
01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:46.375
I'm not doing very well.

1080
01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:49.041
Huh? What's going on here?

1081
01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:52.250
Şakir, the robot
is sending all the rockets back to Earth.


1082
01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:55.208
That was his evil plan
from the beginning. He used us!


1083
01:17:55.291 --> 01:17:58.250
You must stop him.
Blow up the computer. Do something!


1084
01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:01.291
It is too late now.

1085
01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:03.750
It has nothing to do with the computer.

1086
01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:06.291
I transferred everything to this remote.

1087
01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:10.125
The only thing that will stop the rockets
now is this remote,


1088
01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:12.041
and I am in command of it.

1089
01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:15.375
You see, I have decided
I will press this button,


1090
01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.708
sending rockets to end all of mankind.

1091
01:18:17.791 --> 01:18:20.833
You can't decide that. Enough!

1092
01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:24.625
You are finished. You have played
with that suit long enough.


1093
01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:29.541
Huh? Uh, what's happening?

1094
01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:31.625
Whoa!

1095
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.416
Now, if you will excuse me,
my rocket is about to take off.


1096
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.083
I really do not want to be here

1097
01:18:44.166 --> 01:18:47.250
when all the garbage
comes crashing back to Earth.


1098
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:52.708
If we don't find a solution to this,

1099
01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:56.708
all the rockets are going to fall to Earth
in exactly five minutes, 10 seconds.


1100
01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:59.625
Hop on, let's go.

1101
01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:40.625
We won't be able to catch 'em
at this rate.


1102
01:19:40.708 --> 01:19:43.333
We need a miracle. 
That's our only chance!

1103
01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:55.125
- Kebab crush!
- Bomb-bake!


1104
01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:57.916
Pizza! Uh-huh.

1105
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.750
Oh, boy!

1106
01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:03.375
Look guys, it's the restaurant workers
Necati sent a message to!


1107
01:20:05.166 --> 01:20:07.791
Never underestimate a kitchen staff,
my friend.


1108
01:20:08.541 --> 01:20:09.708
Jalapeño!

1109
01:20:15.208 --> 01:20:16.541
Jalapeño!

1110
01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:18.375
He fainted.

1111
01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:23.541
Robot! The robot's leaving!

1112
01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:28.041
Move!

1113
01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:30.208
Hello, robot!

1114
01:21:41.958 --> 01:21:43.625
With your flying skateboard gone…

1115
01:21:43.708 --> 01:21:46.125
…you'll never get off this rocket
in one piece!


1116
01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:48.583
I'm not the one who matters here.

1117
01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:08.333
Good morning, Mirket. 
Good night to me.

1118
01:22:08.416 --> 01:22:10.416
Explosion in five seconds.

1119
01:22:21.666 --> 01:22:23.000
Huh? Canan?

1120
01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:25.708
You don't get to be the hero all the time,
you know.


1121
01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:30.625
Go on. Press the button.

1122
01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:34.333
Quickly. Press it already!

1123
01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:37.541
Come on, Canan, press it.

1124
01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:40.083
Go on. Push it. 
What are you waiting for?

1125
01:22:45.083 --> 01:22:48.125
What? Why in the
world did you do that?

1126
01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:50.750
I'm doing this for all of us, Şakir.

1127
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:53.083
Huh? What do you mean?

1128
01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:56.791
Are you crazy, or what?
You're creating a worldwide disaster.


1129
01:22:56.875 --> 01:22:59.166
We are already in a disaster.

1130
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:01.625
With each passing day, month, year,

1131
01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:04.250
we're doing more and more
to harm the place we live in.


1132
01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:08.541
To our planet, even to space,
to the entire universe.


1133
01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:12.083
Aren't you aware of that?
We need to learn from our mistakes.


1134
01:23:12.166 --> 01:23:14.625
We should not try to run away
from our problems.


1135
01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:17.541
- We have to solve them somehow.
- This is the solution?


1136
01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.750
We should let our entire planet
be covered in garbage?


1137
01:23:19.833 --> 01:23:23.666
Listen! We created all this garbage.
It's on us to clean it up.


1138
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:27.250
We must face our problems
and try to find a solution.


1139
01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:30.791
And in creating all that,
we must never give up, no matter what.


1140
01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:38.791
Şakir, trust me on this.
I'm doing the right thing.


1141
01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:39.625
One year later.

1142
01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:43.125
Dear viewers,
today marks the one-year anniversary


1143
01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:44.791
of Trash-mageddon.

1144
01:24:44.875 --> 01:24:50.166
As a matter of
fact, exactly one year ago,

1145
01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:52.833
And every continent got totally trashed.

1146
01:24:52.916 --> 01:24:56.333
So whose trash was this? It was ours.

1147
01:24:56.416 --> 01:24:59.375
It was the garbage we sent into space.

1148
01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:02.250
Whatever happened,
it went around in a circle


1149
01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:03.916
and come right back at us.

1150
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.750
So, was it really that bad?

1151
01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:09.083
Not quite... On the contrary,
maybe it was a good thing.


1152
01:25:09.166 --> 01:25:12.000
Yes, yes, maybe we were scared at first.

1153
01:25:12.083 --> 01:25:13.916
We ran away. We left our homes.

1154
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.958
But then, somehow, we learned to deal with
our trash like responsible citizens.


1155
01:25:19.041 --> 01:25:21.833
We began separating it! Recycling it!

1156
01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:26.000
And made our world as clean as before.
We achieved the impossible.


1157
01:25:26.083 --> 01:25:29.875
Yeah. We all did this. 
All by ourselves.

1158
01:25:30.666 --> 01:25:34.500
Uh, don't you have anything
to say about this, Mr. Expert?


1159
01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:38.625
Well, um… Okay, look,
um… What can I say?

1160
01:25:38.708 --> 01:25:40.875
You can do it, sir. Go on.

1161
01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:44.458
Okay, very well.
I'd like to apologize to everyone.


1162
01:25:44.541 --> 01:25:47.750
I was totally wrong.
But now I realize my mistake.


1163
01:25:47.833 --> 01:25:50.458
Not just me, in fact. 
We all feel guilty.

1164
01:25:51.083 --> 01:25:54.333
Now everyone is aware
of their responsibilities.


1165
01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:57.833
We are all now more conscious
of the zero-waste principle.


1166
01:25:57.916 --> 01:26:02.166
That's because... Because we've learned
at last to think not as individuals,


1167
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.041
but as a conscious society.

1168
01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:06.958
The act of cleaning up
our own personal space


1169
01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:09.916
means we clean the whole planet
in the process.


1170
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.250
Sounds like you need to apologize
to a special someone out there, right?


1171
01:26:14.333 --> 01:26:16.750
Uh, ugh, um…

1172
01:26:16.833 --> 01:26:18.083
Yes, okay. Fine.

1173
01:26:18.166 --> 01:26:20.416
I also apologize to Professor Mirket.

1174
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.708
And you also need to add that you…

1175
01:26:23.791 --> 01:26:26.166
I'm the one with the garbanzo bean head!

1176
01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:28.083
Ah! Okay, great.

1177
01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:30.750
Now, would you please take a minute
to tell us a little bit


1178
01:26:30.833 --> 01:26:32.750
about the zero-waste application?

1179
01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:37.375
The definition of zero waste is that
all discarded trash must be reused,


1180
01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:39.708
regardless of whether it's organic
or plastic.


1181
01:26:40.333 --> 01:26:43.750
It can never be burned or dumped
into the land, water or air,


1182
01:26:43.833 --> 01:26:46.541
as that could threaten the environment
and human health.


1183
01:26:46.625 --> 01:26:50.375
Thanks to the smart recycling garbage cans
designed by Professor Mirket,


1184
01:26:50.458 --> 01:26:54.458
all the garbage we throw away
is sorted into categories,


1185
01:26:54.541 --> 01:26:59.000
making the zero-waste system
more useful and easy than ever before.


1186
01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:02.333
Mm-hmm. Well, what do you think?

1187
01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:05.708
Will we be able to one day forget
this disaster?


1188
01:27:05.791 --> 01:27:07.375
Well, I hope not.

1189
01:27:07.458 --> 01:27:10.583
Because surely,
the heroes who love our planet,


1190
01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:13.708
like Canan, Şakir
and all the children watching us today,


1191
01:27:13.791 --> 01:27:15.750
will always remind us of our mistakes,

1192
01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:18.833
and of this dark chapter
in our recent history.


1193
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.958
Hey! How are you doing, neighbors?

1194
01:27:24.041 --> 01:27:25.666
Everyone listen to me.

1195
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.041
Ah! I bet he's
going to sing a song.

1196
01:27:29.125 --> 01:27:31.791
That's right! I'm starting.

1197
01:27:31.875 --> 01:27:33.875
Remzi, just follow my lead.

1198
01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:36.958
