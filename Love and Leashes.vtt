00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.780
<i>No relationship
is perfectly equal in the world.</i>


3
00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.322
<i>When two people meet,</i>

4
00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.076
<i>the power dynamic shifts
to one or the other.</i>


5
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.411
<i>No matter the intention.</i>

6
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.121
<i>Perhaps, deep down,</i>

7
00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.958
<i>the instinctive desire
to dominate or submit to another person</i>


8
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.377
<i>is tough to weigh in our subconscious.</i>

9
00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.381
<i>Isn't there at least one secret desire</i>

10
00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:52.510
<i>waiting within your heart
that you can't admit to anyone?</i>


11
00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.735
- Mr. Jung Jihoo.
- Yes?


12
00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.657
First day of your reassignment
and you're the first one in the office!


13
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.825
Hello.

14
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.618
Ah.

15
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.204
Sorry, Jiwoo. Please meet Jihoo.

16
00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:05.416
Hello.

17
00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.378
Mr. Yang may have left,

18
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.630
but Jung Jihoo,
the business teams' poster child,


19
00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.716
is joining our PR team
in his place as assistant manager.


20
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.052
- I'm excited to be here.
- A round of applause!


21
00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:23.476
So you're saying, Jung Jihoo. Jung Jiwoo?
Sounds very similar.


22
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.229
And with the same last name too?
This will be confusing.


23
00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.524
Come on, it's easy.
They have different jobs. One's a girl.


24
00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.776
Let's have a team dinner tonight.

25
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.697
As for the menu, which do you guys prefer?
The lamb or the lamb?


26
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.281
I'll take the lamb.

27
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:41.411
Manager Hwang, I like lamb too,
but the corporate card is maxed out.


28
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.789
Plus, we haven't really decided

29
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.917
on how to proceed regarding casting
the YouTuber that you talked about yet.


30
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.003
Listen...

31
00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.754
It's not that we haven't decided,

32
00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.215
I know it's because
you personally don't like that YouTuber.


33
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.968
Do you know how many subscribers he has?

34
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:59.554
We shouldn't have someone
who made homophobic comments


35
00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.723
be associated
with our educational content.


36
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.809
I... I wouldn't say
what he said was homophobic.


37
00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.686
It just made him uncomfortable, right?

38
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.270
How about this,

39
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.982
if he's someone
who might become a liability,


40
00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:13.359
why don't we wait
and think it over a little more.


41
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.155
I mean, it is your decision that affects
the image of our channel.


42
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.616
See? Why can't you be more like him.

43
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.660
If you want to bring up something
that was already decided,


44
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.163
and sacrifice the energy and efficiency
of the group meeting,


45
00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.498
at least... at least smile like him,

46
00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.250
and be more polite about it.

47
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.212
Guys, it's not just your lovers
you should be cute for.


48
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.588
There he goes again.

49
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.671
Hold on.

50
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.508
Mr. Hwang, did you just say "cute"?

51
00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.426
Um...

52
00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:42.513
What I mean is
teamwork is important for this job.


53
00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:46.100
So let's all just try
being nicer to each other, all right?


54
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.894
These talks are so difficult...

55
00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.188
...because our team has women.

56
00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:53.358
The PR team is different than I expected.

57
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.281
You'd be in trouble
if the business team heard.


58
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.486
But what trouble you mean?

59
00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.030
Manager Hwang, don't you know?

60
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.075
That's considered sexual harassment.

61
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.663
He passed!

62
00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.457
You see, I was just trying
to test his gender sensitivity.


63
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.959
He passed the test.

64
00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:11.918
Okay, then.

65
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.294
Let's do this,

66
00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.049
Mr. Jung and Jiwoo,
who is always on the ball,


67
00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:22.553
they can work together to make a list
of potential people to cast.


68
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.722
Man, can't wait.

69
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.983
Thank you.

70
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.776
Mm-hmm. Let's have a farewell party.

71
00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:40.571
- Just the four of us. It's on me.
- Wow, he has his own fan club.


72
00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:43.241
So that's the face someone makes
when they know


73
00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.827
everyone's obsessed with them, huh?

74
00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.788
A guy like that
doesn't interest you, right?


75
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.081
He does.

76
00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.164
Oh?

77
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:52.875
He does.

78
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.959
Oh.

79
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.006
How you settling in
at the PR team?


80
00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.049
- Why is he staring?
- Sorry, I should go.


81
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.135
- See you later.
- For real? Staring?


82
00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.015
- Well, here's Mr. Popular.
- Oh, no.


83
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.392
They're just my former colleagues
from the business team.


84
00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.603
Um, Jiwoo?

85
00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:14.105
Yes?

86
00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:16.441
Good job saving us from that disaster
waiting to happen


87
00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:18.234
if we hired that YouTuber.

88
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:22.447
I believe it's necessary for the PR team
to be sensitive and with the times.


89
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.450
- I appreciate it.
- I'm happy to be here.


90
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.827
I'll see you at the meeting later.

91
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.084
You say you're interested
but you don't want to show it at all.


92
00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.628
It's not like I'll do anything about it.

93
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:38.712
What?

94
00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.423
What do you mean by that?

95
00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:43.009
And what is it that
you wouldn't do?


96
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.802
Nothing like that.

97
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.096
Sweetie,

98
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.932
if you want a boyfriend, use your eyes.

99
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.016
Smile a little.

100
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:03.321
You can always smile, but remember
to always keep the ball in your court.


101
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.700
And don't even think about
asking him out first.


102
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.203
Guys lose interest
if the girl's too forward.


103
00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:14.248
Mom, all I said was that
I think he's kinda cute.


104
00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:18.711
Come on, it's hard to find a cute guy.
You don't see many at work.


105
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.296
- Hmm?
- That's true.


106
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.383
But why can't I ask him out first?

107
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.135
This isn't like 1920 anymore.

108
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.181
Even in the year 2320,
it'll be the same, huh?


109
00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:32.767
Guys have an instinct to hunt within them.

110
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.354
They have an inclination to dominate
after chasing and hunting their prey.


111
00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:38.189
What am I, a rabbit or something?

112
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.151
- Hey, women went hunting too, you know!
- Hey, that face again?


113
00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:44.904
Well, then hunt then.

114
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.489
Life is boring,

115
00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.658
so just do something with it.

116
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.080
- Thank you.
- Sure.


117
00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:55.706
Oh, that... that can't be.

118
00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.501
I just got a text that
it was delivered yesterday.


119
00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.878
Goodness.
Nothing came for the business team.


120
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.630
Sir, I... I transferred to the PR team.

121
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:03.713
PR team?

122
00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:04.924
Yeah.

123
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.760
Oh, was that package
meant for you instead?


124
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.096
- Someone picked it up already.
- What?


125
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.179
Who took it?

126
00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.696
Excuse me. Sorry.

127
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.094
Hmm?

128
00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.262
Please!

129
00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:56.392
Jiwoo, wait!

130
00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.102
Whoa!

131
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.827
Ta-da!

132
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:15.995
It's my dog's collar.

133
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:18.206
You know,
collars are required by law nowadays.


134
00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:21.167
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I thought it came for me.

135
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.921
Mm-mm. This was bound to happen
sooner or later since our names are alike.


136
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.004
It's backwards.

137
00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.632
Your dog's name is Miho?

138
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:30.968
Uh, yes!

139
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.054
Miho, isn't it a pretty name?

140
00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.472
She's female.

141
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.267
Poodle. She's three.

142
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.351
Oh.

143
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:43.481
It seems, um, a
bit big for a poodle.

144
00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:49.820
I guess you haven't seen my poodle.
Miho's neck is super thick.


145
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.489
It's like that.

146
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.537
- The leash.
- Oh, sure.


147
00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.542
I'll throw this out for you.

148
00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.909
Oh! I'll... I'll throw it out!

149
00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.477
THE LARGEST SM ADULT SHOP IN THE COUNTRY

150
00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:24.480
15% OFF FOR RE

151
00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:30.361
Pa... Paper... Paper should be recycled.
I'll throw this away.


152
00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:32.238
Why would you throw away a coupon?

153
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.119
You have, uh,

154
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.664
really good eyesight, huh?

155
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.503
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.


156
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.637
<i>What? A pervert?</i>

157
00:09:57.805 --> 00:09:58.973
<i>It's the pervert!</i>

158
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.435
You all right?

159
00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:03.978
Here's water.

160
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:06.439
<i>Well protect the school
from the pervert.</i>


161
00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:08.024
<i>Doongi doongi, change!</i>

162
00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.900
- No worries. I'm fine.
- All right.


163
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.902
<i>Let's see where
he's hiding!</i>


164
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.702
<i>One good thing
is that no one seems to know yet.</i>


165
00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.747
<i>And that co-worker
isn't treating me any differently.</i>


166
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.333
<i>Maybe there's hope?</i>

167
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.918
<i>It's too soon to relax.</i>

168
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:31.047
<i>I've seen someone who was in
a similar situation at my old work place.</i>


169
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.841
<i>Eventually, word got out
and they asked him to resign.</i>


170
00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:36.552
<i>Maybe that colleague's like us too.</i>

171
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.346
<i>I've seen posts about it in the past.</i>

172
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.432
<i>They met someone in real life
who happened to also be into BDSM.</i>


173
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.309
<i>There's more of us than we think.</i>

174
00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:46.145
<i>Just look at us. No one who knows us
would ever think we're into it.</i>


175
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.480
Jiwoo? Really?

176
00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.488
<i>Still,
it's too dangerous to tell her.</i>


177
00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:57.615
<i>Avoid it at all costs. 
Be careful.</i>

178
00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.700
Since you've found out...

179
00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:07.017
I'm sorry,
but I don't even like wearing turtlenecks.


180
00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:09.436
Hmm?

181
00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:12.064
Jiwoo, what are you doing?

182
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.443
Don't just look. Go inside. Hmm.

183
00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:17.987
Don't just leave. 
Want me to buy you one?

184
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.910
- No, stop. Leave me alone.
- I'll buy you one.


185
00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:22.575
- What should we eat for lunch?
- This color doesn't fit, right?


186
00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:25.498
- I think the color has to be like this.
- It looks like he's wearing...


187
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.620
Excuse me,

188
00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:28.581
Jiwoo isn't coming today, right?

189
00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:30.624
She just went over
to check on the venue.

190
00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.544
Manager Hwang totally screwed her over.

191
00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:35.546
It would be good for her
to be more flexible.


192
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:36.881
I agree with that.

193
00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:39.091
Han, did you move Doong-doong and Toy?

194
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:43.137
Yes, I picked up Toy from the supply room,
now as for Doong-doong, uh...


195
00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:46.807
- I don't know.
- Where did he go? Huh?


196
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.142
Doong-doong!

197
00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:51.604
Am I asking the intern
to do too much right now?


198
00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:53.898
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.


199
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:55.065
Don't worry about it.

200
00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:56.484
Thank you.

201
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.989
<i>Hello, Jiwoo.
Are you enjoying your weekend?</i>


202
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.826
<i>I'm writing because
I never got the chance to thank you...</i>


203
00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:09.997
Yes, sir. I just checked the venue,
and came in to check on the...


204
00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:20.508
Oh!

205
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.010
Who are you?

206
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:27.389
Why are you wearing that?

207
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.567
Doong-doong. Doong-doong, doong!

208
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:42.863
- Is that Mr. Jung?
- No, no! It's not! It's not!


209
00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:46.951
Wait! Oh! Mr. Jung!

210
00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:48.702
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.


211
00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.913
No, don't lie to me. 
You're not okay!

212
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:57.962
Wow.

213
00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.428
Why are you acting so stupid?

214
00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.644
I'm really sorry.

215
00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:16.814
Okay, don't move.

216
00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:18.523
Are you dizzy?

217
00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:21.944
Doong-doong is, uh...
So I'm fine. Thank you.


218
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:25.698
Well, still, you just hit your head.
You need a doctor.


219
00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:29.326
Let's go right now!

220
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.578
I'm okay.

221
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.678
Sorry you wasted your weekend
on me like this.


222
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:49.179
What'd you mean when you sent this?

223
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:51.807
I JUST WANT TO
SAY THANK YOU AND SORRY.

224
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.017
Well...

225
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.896
I wanted to thank you

226
00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:00.816
for not telling anyone at work
about everything that you saw before.


227
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.235
Of course. It's none of my business.

228
00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:07.323
Thank you so much.

229
00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.742
Thank you for today too.
And I'm sorry as well.


230
00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:10.910
Have a seat.

231
00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:12.827
Okay.

232
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.292
Actually, I'm sorry too.

233
00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:19.668
What?

234
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:23.464
I feel bad for startling you
and ordering you around back there.


235
00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:26.759
The truth is,

236
00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:29.178
I actually have a tendency
to be like that.


237
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.096
To be like what?

238
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.641
I've never done anything like that
at work before.


239
00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.684
<i>Maybe that colleague
is like us too.</i>


240
00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.145
<i>I've seen posts about it in the past.</i>

241
00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:39.980
...but you don't have to avoid me.

242
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:42.149
It may look like I don't care
what others think


243
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:43.859
because of my tendencies,

244
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.444
- but I do...
- Jiwoo.


245
00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:49.239
Thank you very much
for being so honest with me.


246
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.909
I'm so thankful and so relieved.

247
00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:55.329
I was really worried
that you would think I'm a pervert,


248
00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:57.122
but in reality, you're one of us.

249
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.500
Wow, this is so amazing! 
It's like fate!

250
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:02.878
- I don't think you're a pervert.
- Exactly! Of course not.


251
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.215
The world is cruel for saying we are.

252
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.467
To be completely honest,

253
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:11.595
I kind of thought that
you might be into it too.


254
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:14.515
If it's too hard to hide it,
and if you don't mind that it's me,


255
00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:15.808
you can do anything to me.

256
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:17.851
Do what?

257
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.853
Order me around, scream, anything!

258
00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.106
Just think of me as your pet dog
and treat me like one.


259
00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.984
It was fate that
we met each other at work.


260
00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:28.529
Let's be open and honest
about our tendencies!


261
00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.116
Oh.

262
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:34.909
What?

263
00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:36.787
Ah...

264
00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:39.873
When I said I had a tendency,

265
00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:42.251
that... that wasn't really
what I meant at all.


266
00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:44.378
What?

267
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:47.464
People always say
I'm so aloof and look intimidating,


268
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:50.009
so I have a bit of a complex.
That's what I meant.


269
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:52.636
Oh, I see.

270
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:54.721
That collar!

271
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:59.018
It wasn't meant for a woman.
You bought it for yourself?


272
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.812
Uh, that... that's not it.

273
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.567
BDSM.

274
00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:14.658
<i>Among the many types, there is DS,</i>

275
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.535
<i>which is
a dominant-submissive relationship.</i>


276
00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:18.078
Sit, Pippi.

277
00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.747
And Sit.

278
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.831
Now down.

279
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:22.249
Roll over.

280
00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:23.167
There you go.

281
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.877
Good job.

282
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.546
<i>The person
who gives orders is the dominant.</i>


283
00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:31.216
<i>On the other hand,
the person who obeys is the submissive.</i>


284
00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.470
Hey, what's with with her today?

285
00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:37.931
She usually squints with her eyes
and pets the dogs.


286
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.476
She's been staring
at her phone nonstop all day.


287
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.559
Huh?

288
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:46.148
<i>Often referred to
as Doms and Subs for short.</i>


289
00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.900
- Want a sub?
- A sub?


290
00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:49.610
What? Why?

291
00:17:49.693 --> 00:17:52.446
Well, I make a real mean sandwich.
Why are you so startled?


292
00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:54.782
- Oh.
- Half off since you're a regular.


293
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.328
Ah.

294
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.499
Oh, I don't understand
a word you're saying.


295
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:07.377
Explain it to me,
so I don't think it's weird because I do.


296
00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:09.338
Okay.

297
00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:14.134
Imagine Woohyuk
secretly hates dogs.


298
00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:17.930
What do you mean? He loves dogs.
He's more like a dog than actual dogs.


299
00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:19.932
But let's just say he's terrified of dogs,

300
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:23.685
but he pretends to like dogs
because he's afraid people might say,


301
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.897
"What? How can you possibly hate dogs?
Are you a psychopath?"


302
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.274
But then you find out his hidden truth.

303
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.945
You know, you're making
even less sense right now, but, okay.


304
00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:34.113
So what?

305
00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:39.284
Is it then better for me
to ignore all of this in him?


306
00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:40.869
Or should I pity him?

307
00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:44.665
Do you want to care
for the dog-hater or choke him?


308
00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:46.291
Care for.

309
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:49.711
He's cute.

310
00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:57.052
Then play dumb and give him time.
He's probably a bit embarrassed.


311
00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.471
He'll be even more
so if you overdo it.

312
00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:18.115
Doong-doong got
a lot of new followers today.


313
00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:20.492
Offline events have a special charm.

314
00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.161
Well, I'm glad it's going so well.

315
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.663
Mr. Hwang would've gotten on us
if it had failed.


316
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.000
He showed zero interest in preparing it.

317
00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:31.378
And now, he's sending screenshots
of the new follower account.


318
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.756
I wish he'd actually show up
instead of just sending pictures.


319
00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.968
Let me go to the office and check
the schedule of the performances.


320
00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:40.804
Mm-hmm. Ah!

321
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:42.014
A video call.

322
00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:43.932
Good luck.

323
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:46.977
Hello, sir. Can you see me?

324
00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:52.024
Jiwoo, isn't it almost lunch time?

325
00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:54.735
What are you doing now?
You can't take that off here.


326
00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:56.653
I'll tell you when
the lunch gets here, okay?


327
00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.017
Water, please!

328
00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:01.200
Sorry, but I need
to go to the office.

329
00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.283
Cover for me!

330
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.203
Jiwoo.

331
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.123
Could I go with you?

332
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.083
No, it only needs one person to go.

333
00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.710
Then let me do it for you.

334
00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:12.793
No, I'll go.

335
00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:13.921
See you, Mr. Jung.

336
00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.895
Jeez, you're overcooking the meat.

337
00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:32.064
That's not an air fryer. Give me that.

338
00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:34.775
Jiwoo, over here! Come!

339
00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.069
Here, have some crispy meat.

340
00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:38.779
Thank you.

341
00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:41.216
- It's hard as rubber.
- I overcooked it, right?


342
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.440
- Should I order another plate?
- No, it's fine.


343
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.245
Hey, did you see
the Instagram comments about the event?


344
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:47.162
Yeah.

345
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.914
- They're going crazy!
- Right.


346
00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:51.124
- I told you we should do it.
- Soju, right?


347
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.542
You should listen.

348
00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:55.087
- I think that was a good call, boss.
- Shit!


349
00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:57.797
Good work.

350
00:20:58.715 --> 00:20:59.715
Thanks.

351
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.929
You're actually really good
at grilling meat. Hmm?


352
00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:06.807
I wonder what Jihoo's flaws are.
What do you think, Jiwoo?


353
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.392
You can't cook meat.

354
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.560
- Men should know...
- I wouldn't know.


355
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:13.689
It's not like we're close.

356
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.452
Women should
be able to cut fruits.


357
00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:19.444
Women must learn to cut fruits
to find a good husband.


358
00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:22.489
So disgusting.
He makes me sick.


359
00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:30.622
- Bye!
- Get home safely.


360
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.128
Good luck with Jihoo!

361
00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.421
Goodbye!

362
00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.383
Why can't I get a cab around here?

363
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:45.304
Why do I hear a dog?

364
00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:46.888
Oh my Gosh!

365
00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.474
Is that Mr. Jung?

366
00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:54.521
What's wrong?

367
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:00.485
Do you feel sick?

368
00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:03.655
Are you crying?

369
00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:04.739
No.

370
00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:08.827
Yes, you are.

371
00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:13.623
I... I'm not crying.

372
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.376
Why are you crying?

373
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.503
Well, I like you, but...

374
00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:22.799
I understand if you think I'm disgusting

375
00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.843
and sicken you,

376
00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:27.888
but because I was just transferred here,

377
00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:31.933
it's too hard to request another transfer.

378
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:34.269
I'm very sorry.

379
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.064
You're a crybaby.

380
00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:39.941
I've never told anyone about this
other than Hana.


381
00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.651
Okay, who's Hana?

382
00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:48.367
She dumped me for being a pervert.

383
00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:57.625
Mr. Jung,

384
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.253
I didn't avoid you because of that.

385
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:04.257
I thought you might be uncomfortable
and awkward around me.


386
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.675
So I gave you space.

387
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:08.095
Until we became comfortable.

388
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.681
So I don't make you sick?

389
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:14.267
I told you,
I don't really think you're a pervert.


390
00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:17.270
Well, maybe you are a pervert.

391
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.981
Isn't everyone
a little bit perverted in some ways?


392
00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:25.694
Do you know...

393
00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:28.615
how awesome you are?

394
00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:30.534
Me?

395
00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:34.329
Jiwoo, would you...

396
00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:37.791
Do you think you could be my master?

397
00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:40.919
Um, well...

398
00:23:41.002 --> 00:23:43.588
I'm not saying
we should go out just purely.


399
00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:45.382
Be my master.

400
00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:48.468
- M... Master?
- Yes!


401
00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:50.762
It'd be nice to have someone like you

402
00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:52.681
as my master.

403
00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:55.767
No.

404
00:23:57.477 --> 00:23:59.729
All right.

405
00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:00.813
Sorry.

406
00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:05.986
This will never happen again.

407
00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:11.992
But don't you need a designated driver?

408
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.291
Every machine
that you touch breaks.


409
00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:22.502
It's not broken.
I think it's a paper jam.


410
00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:26.465
It's a good thing for us though,
since we got to see you.


411
00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:28.592
Call me over
even if things aren't breaking.


412
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.179
I always ask you to have lunch,
but you say you're too busy.


413
00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:34.181
You're all talk.

414
00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:35.932
You're eyes
are screaming murder.


415
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:37.558
Jiwoo,

416
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:38.935
glaring at a guy...

417
00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:42.189
...isn't going to help seduce him.

418
00:24:42.272 --> 00:24:43.815
I'm not trying to seduce him.

419
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:45.275
Look at them.

420
00:24:45.358 --> 00:24:47.903
You can literally see hearts
in their eyes for him.


421
00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:51.698
Have you considered
being more flirtatious?


422
00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:54.325
I'm gonna get going.

423
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:05.169
Mr. Jung.

424
00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:07.506
Nice.

425
00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:09.174
Thank you.

426
00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:32.072
<i>Mr. Jung, are you busy?</i>

427
00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.282
<i>I need to tell you something right now.</i>

428
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:35.951
<i>I'll wait in the lounge.</i>

429
00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:59.307
What is it that you
need to tell me here?

430
00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:04.478
Wear this.

431
00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:08.817
- What?
- I don't know about being a master,


432
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.900
but I'm curious.

433
00:26:11.152 --> 00:26:12.152
Put this on.

434
00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:13.613
Am I dreaming?

435
00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:16.877
- But this is so sudden. I... I...
- Forget it if you don't want to.


436
00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.326
Don't worry! I never said that.

437
00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:21.538
I'll put it on.

438
00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:57.574
- Uh, but, Jiwoo...
- Shh! Just lie down here.


439
00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:29.064
I wanted to ask you something
after hearing what you said.


440
00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:31.399
What's that?

441
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.027
You said you wanted someone like me
as a master.


442
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:37.072
What did you mean, "Someone like me?"

443
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.533
I don't think
I've ever met anyone like you.


444
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.829
To be honest,

445
00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:47.582
I had always worried about
what others think.


446
00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:52.504
I act mature so no one hates me
and I look perfect.


447
00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:56.925
But you don't care what others think,
or that people treat you unfairly.


448
00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:59.344
Even when you saw a weirdo like myself,

449
00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:02.180
you were actually so mature.

450
00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:04.349
It wasn't an act. You care.

451
00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:06.976
You made me relax.

452
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.978
We're not close, as you say,

453
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.023
but it's like I was a kid.

454
00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.826
I'm sorry, I keep saying things
to make you uncomfortable.


455
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.535
Not at all.

456
00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:29.958
I promise that I'll make sure
I don't cross the line anymore. I mean it.


457
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.131
To be honest with you,

458
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:39.217
I don't really know anything
about the things you would want.


459
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:40.593
But I'm...

460
00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:42.387
Well, I'm a really quick learner.

461
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.098
I mean, I'll think it over.

462
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.642
So will you stop avoiding me now?

463
00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:49.226
What?

464
00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:52.021
Uh, of course.

465
00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:57.360
Then slowly count to 30, remove it,
and then go back to your desk.


466
00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.872
Thank you, Jiwoo.

467
00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:12.250
You're really the coolest human being

468
00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:13.251
I've ever met.

469
00:29:14.335 --> 00:29:16.296
I said to count to 30.

470
00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:19.132
You're not my master yet, though.

471
00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.467
Who are you waiting for like a puppy?

472
00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:04.260
You, ma'am.

473
00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:07.680
Are you using some cheesy line
about sharing an umbrella?


474
00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:09.224
I'm just trying to persuade you.

475
00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.184
It's my own way of showing that

476
00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:13.102
I'll serve you well.

477
00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:24.447
And I know why
you're looking at me so closely like that.


478
00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:26.323
Oh yeah?

479
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:27.909
You always

480
00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:31.955
focus hard on everything
so that you really see it.


481
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.580
Like that.

482
00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:47.177
Fine.

483
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.013
I will be your master.

484
00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:52.475
Follow me closely,

485
00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:53.852
so I don't get wet.

486
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.689
Okay.

487
00:30:57.772 --> 00:30:59.065
Whoa, whoa!

488
00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:04.404
You can't change your mind tomorrow.

489
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:11.828
<i>DS. Shorthand for
a dominant-submissive relationship.</i>


490
00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:15.874
<i>It refers to a relationship between
one who commands and one who obeys.</i>


491
00:31:15.957 --> 00:31:18.585
<i>Dom, the dominant,
and Sub, the submissive,</i>


492
00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:19.919
<i>can be further categorized</i>

493
00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:24.132
<i>as a Male-Dom, Female-Dom,
Male-Sub, and Female-Sub.</i>


494
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:25.633
Then

495
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:28.595
Mr. Jung has to be

496
00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:31.014
a Male
-Sub?

497
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:37.812
This is a lot.

498
00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:41.065
<i>Congrats to me!</i>

499
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:43.818
<i>I finally got my first ever master!</i>

500
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:45.361
<i>Make some noise!</i>

501
00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:46.738
HOW TO BE A GOOD MASTER

502
00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:51.701
SPANKING FEMME FEMME'S BDSM GUIDE

503
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.288
<i>What is the difference
between DS and SM?</i>


504
00:31:55.371 --> 00:31:59.500
<i>DS is more of a psychological game
based on the relationship dynamics.</i>


505
00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.043
<i>SM is</i>

506
00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:05.173
<i>more of a physical and sensual play.</i>

507
00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:08.301
<i>Of course,
they're not completely unrelated.</i>


508
00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:12.221
<i>Some couples in a DS relationship
may enjoy SM play.</i>


509
00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:13.514
<i>But most of the time,</i>

510
00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:16.225
<i>they're both separate
from romantic relationships.</i>


511
00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:20.355
<i>Since DS and SM relationships
are based on a clear hierarchy,</i>


512
00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:23.149
<i>whereas in romance, we aim for equality.</i>

513
00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:25.818
<i>But of course,
this doesn't mean it's impossible.</i>


514
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:28.279
<i>But I think it's hard to juggle
both a romantic relationship</i>


515
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:30.323
<i>with a DS relationship.</i>

516
00:33:02.188 --> 00:33:04.273
<i>That feels good, Jihoo.</i>

517
00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:11.698
<i>Did your ex-girlfriend
not like it when you did this to her?</i>


518
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:16.035
<i>She did when she didn't know
I was into BDSM.</i>


519
00:33:17.036 --> 00:33:18.663
<i>She hated it once she knew.</i>

520
00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:23.835
You say you like being hated because

521
00:33:23.918 --> 00:33:25.086
you're a pervert.

522
00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:48.526
Master, I'm sorry I'm late
on your first command.


523
00:33:48.609 --> 00:33:50.278
As your sub, this will never happen.

524
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:52.113
We need to set some rules.

525
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:54.907
<i>Establish rules that apply
only to the two of you.</i>


526
00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:55.991
Rules?

527
00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:58.619
First, don't call me master.

528
00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.538
I want you to call me "Jiwoo."

529
00:34:01.831 --> 00:34:04.333
- What about "Lady Jiwoo"?
- Call me "Jiwoo."


530
00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.253
I'll punish disobedience.

531
00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:09.881
You'll punish me?

532
00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:13.009
Why do you look so excited?

533
00:34:13.092 --> 00:34:14.886
Excited? No, no, no!

534
00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:15.969
Definitely not.

535
00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:18.347
<i>Punish
and compliment him regularly.</i>


536
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:24.312
I've read the Sub can feel dominated by

537
00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:26.898
simply carrying a gift
they got from their masters.


538
00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:32.361
Jiwoo,

539
00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:34.781
you really studied up on it.

540
00:34:34.864 --> 00:34:37.158
<i>It's good
to put conditions on your orders.</i>


541
00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:38.951
Those glasses are a sign.

542
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:42.038
If you ever need
my order in the office,

543
00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:43.122
just put them on.

544
00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:55.676
So then,
do you want to stamp it or sign it?


545
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.096
- What?
- Our contract.


546
00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.306
<i>Jung Jiwoo,
hereinafter "the Dom,"</i>


547
00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:01.891
<i>must maintain an image of perfection,</i>

548
00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:04.685
<i>that Jung Jihoo,
hereinafter "the Sub", can respect.</i>


549
00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:07.897
Mr. Hwang had spicy pork yesterday,
and you're craving something spicy.


550
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.857
Then we'll get two level-one,
and two level-two


551
00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:11.609
rice cakes and rice balls.

552
00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:13.402
And we'll add one Calpico.

553
00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:19.659
<i>The Sub must try
to serve the Dom</i>


554
00:35:19.742 --> 00:35:21.452
<i>to the best of his abilities.</i>

555
00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:28.543
<i>The contract is effective
for three months from the date of signing.</i>


556
00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:32.296
<i>Neither party may terminate the contract
without the other's consent.</i>


557
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.091
<i>The Dom and Sub will play
at least once a week.</i>


558
00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:39.095
<i>The Dom and Sub
shall establish a safe word to use</i>


559
00:35:39.178 --> 00:35:41.472
<i>during dangerous
or urgent situations during play.</i>


560
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:42.431
UNDER MAINTENANCE

561
00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:45.560
<i>Once the safe word is said,
play must terminate immediately.</i>


562
00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:49.522
Safe words are usually random words
that you wouldn't use all the time.


563
00:35:49.605 --> 00:35:51.566
And something that's easy to pronounce.

564
00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:55.570
For example, <i>The Sensual M,</i>
or something like soondae soup.


565
00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:58.406
Is there a word you've wanted to use?

566
00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.826
I'd like a word that's meaningful
to both of us.


567
00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:03.995
Something meaningful?

568
00:36:04.912 --> 00:36:05.912
Doong-doong?

569
00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:16.340
<i>Sex is permitted upon consent
of both the Dom and Sub.</i>


570
00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:20.761
Uh,

571
00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:24.223
well, I just found
a generic contract online.


572
00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:25.933
I didn't really change much, you know?

573
00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:28.477
Okay, I understand what
you're worried about.


574
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:29.812
No touching.

575
00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:31.981
I don't have any hidden agendas for you.

576
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:38.404
JUNG JIHOO

577
00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:56.881
Some places are called hotels
but are worse than motels.


578
00:36:56.964 --> 00:37:00.092
Not that I'm an expert
in motels or anything.


579
00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:05.348
I wonder where the cleanest would be.

580
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:08.476
- I think there's a nice one over...
- It's here on the app.


581
00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:09.559
Make a right.

582
00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:11.186
Yes.

583
00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:39.423
You mean, you haven't used it yet?

584
00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:40.383
No.

585
00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:43.386
Collars just have
a certain kind of aesthetic, so,


586
00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:46.180
I'm always able to feel satisfaction
just by looking at...


587
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:47.807
Things are meant to be worn.

588
00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:56.482
<i>During play, it is important
for the Dom to not get flustered.</i>


589
00:37:57.108 --> 00:38:00.111
<i>Because the Dom
must always look perfect to the Sub.</i>


590
00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:29.140
<i>Dog play.</i>

591
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.228
<i>An introduction level,
soft but standard play, in the SM world.</i>


592
00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.355
<i>Treat him like you would a real dog.</i>

593
00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:37.439
Hand.

594
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.403
And head.

595
00:39:00.921 --> 00:39:03.466
I'll give you a reward
if you're good and you obey me.


596
00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:10.598
Yes. Anything you say.

597
00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:11.681
Oh?

598
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.768
A dog speaking like a human?

599
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.020
Oh! Ah!

600
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:07.113
No, no! Stop that!

601
00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:09.573
No, no!

602
00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:11.617
No, no. Stop that! Stop!

603
00:40:12.952 --> 00:40:13.786
And sit!

604
00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:14.703
Sit!

605
00:40:16.288 --> 00:40:17.373
Now down!

606
00:40:18.457 --> 00:40:19.457
Floor!

607
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.335
That's it. Yes. Good boy.

608
00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:23.254
Here.

609
00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:26.382
Oh! Whoa!

610
00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.598
No! Stop!

611
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:35.891
No, stop it! Stop it!

612
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:36.809
Ow! Ow!

613
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:41.021
Stop your dog from barking!

614
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.361
How dare
a dog talk back to a human?


615
00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:51.323
Excuse me? Hello?

616
00:40:51.407 --> 00:40:53.242
We received a noise complaint.

617
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:08.048
Okay, then.

618
00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:10.718
Thank you for your work.

619
00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:13.053
Y... yes. So...

620
00:41:13.762 --> 00:41:14.762
Thank you very much.

621
00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:23.230
"Thank you for your work"?

622
00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:25.649
Did I just say that?

623
00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:36.702
Just say the editing department
put it in by mistake.


624
00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:38.078
Why must we dig into it?

625
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:39.830
Mr. Hwang,

626
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:43.167
if we avoid taking responsibility
it might cause bigger problems later.


627
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.753
It's a children's show
with barely average ratings.


628
00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.254
Why are you so insistent?

629
00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:51.842
Shouldn't we be more careful
<i>because</i> it's a children's show?


630
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:57.306
Jiwoo, do you have the documents
from that copyright complaint?


631
00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:59.141
- Please gather them.
- Yes.


632
00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:01.393
Han, book the conference room
for three o'clock.


633
00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:04.355
- Okay.
- We need to resolve this now, Mr. Hwang.


634
00:42:07.107 --> 00:42:08.817
Why do I feel like I was threatened?

635
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.622
Jihoo's impressive.

636
00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:24.667
Mr. Hwang isn't saying a peep.
That felt cathartic.


637
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:28.295
Right? When I complained to him,
he just ignored me.


638
00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:31.632
I should be better.

639
00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:33.509
The better you do here,

640
00:42:33.592 --> 00:42:36.929
the more he'll try to humiliate you
just because you're a woman.


641
00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:39.807
Jiwoo, when can I expect
the budget for the festival?


642
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.058
I put it there earlier.

643
00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:47.398
Didn't you think to tell me
so that I'd know?


644
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.067
These brats have no respect
for their boss.


645
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.360
Ugh! My life sucks.

646
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:09.003
Jiwoo, aren't you going home?

647
00:43:12.798 --> 00:43:13.798
Mr. Jung,

648
00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.802
were you hurt yesterday?

649
00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:19.179
I should've been more prepared. I'm sorry.

650
00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:24.435
If you feel bad about it,

651
00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:28.022
then please let me plan
the next one for us.


652
00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:36.071
I hope you enjoy it.

653
00:43:46.915 --> 00:43:49.168
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to... ♪</i>

654
00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:56.300
You were supposed to wait for the song.

655
00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:57.551
Today is not my birthday.

656
00:43:58.427 --> 00:44:01.138
I know, it's tomorrow.
I saw it on KakaoTalk.


657
00:44:02.514 --> 00:44:04.516
We'll probably celebrate at the office,

658
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.852
but I wanted to be
the first one to say it to you.


659
00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:08.728
Ma...

660
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480
Master.

661
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:16.654
Happy birthday.

662
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:35.214
Let me do this one.

663
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.309
They are so...

664
00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:50.521
They look so pretty.

665
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:54.024
Thank you, but I feel bad.

666
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:57.653
I don't think I've done nearly enough
to deserve this yet.


667
00:44:57.736 --> 00:44:59.196
I messed up last time.

668
00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:02.616
What do you mean?
You're just like the sun to me, Jiwoo.


669
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.786
I'm just very grateful that
you were even born in my lifetime.


670
00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:08.580
Well then, thank you.

671
00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:12.418
So, should I step on you?

672
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:14.252
Uh...

673
00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:17.131
It wasn't as if

674
00:45:17.756 --> 00:45:19.633
I was expecting that, but...

675
00:45:35.607 --> 00:45:39.278
You weren't expecting it,
but you looked quite prepared for it.


676
00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:41.947
No, I... I, uh...

677
00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:45.200
I've always dreamed about it,
so I instinctively...


678
00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:46.827
Dreamed about it?

679
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.205
I mean, it's nothing
to get all weirded out by really. Uh...


680
00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:52.875
Well, it's... it's a bit like that,
but what I mean is...


681
00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:54.042
Shh!

682
00:45:54.668 --> 00:45:57.296
It should be somewhere
no one else can see.


683
00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:36.418
Does it hurt much?

684
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:40.422
It's killing me.

685
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.579
Want me to stop?

686
00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:16.875
I'm so happy...

687
00:47:18.043 --> 00:47:19.127
...it's you.

688
00:47:38.897 --> 00:47:41.942
<i>I'm usually competitive,
so I like to win.</i>


689
00:47:44.653 --> 00:47:46.655
<i>Even with the little things,</i>

690
00:47:46.738 --> 00:47:50.784
<i>I hate looking easy
or losing to guys who act tough.</i>


691
00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:56.999
<i>I think I didn't want others
to find out that I was weak.</i>


692
00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:01.461
<i>When I'm a total mess on the inside.</i>

693
00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:09.052
<i>That's why I like the feeling
of everything crumbling down.</i>


694
00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:13.348
<i>I like failing and being stomped on.</i>

695
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.976
<i>I like being broken.</i>

696
00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:23.734
<i>Only by you.</i>

697
00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:21.041
Seduce him.

698
00:49:23.752 --> 00:49:25.420
So it's a done deal.

699
00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:27.631
He even gave you a birthday present.
It's obvious.


700
00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:31.259
He shared a secret with you,
whatever it is.


701
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:33.595
And you're working on a project together.

702
00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:36.098
Ask him to dinner. No, drinks.

703
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:39.851
That, uh, may be construed
as an abuse of power.


704
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:41.937
He's an assistant manager,
you're a subordinate,


705
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.271
what are you worried about?

706
00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:44.940
Well,

707
00:49:45.023 --> 00:49:48.610
regardless, I think we should keep
our private lives separate from work.


708
00:49:48.694 --> 00:49:51.279
Don't be jealous, Pippi. Stop.

709
00:49:51.363 --> 00:49:53.699
Stop it. Hush!

710
00:49:53.782 --> 00:49:55.158
He's so loud.

711
00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:57.995
You're really old-fashioned.

712
00:49:58.745 --> 00:50:00.205
Well, do as you wish.

713
00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:01.415
Are you going on a date?

714
00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:03.208
Yes, something like that.

715
00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:06.837
A professional office romance?

716
00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:08.839
Won't be that easy.

717
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:19.975
Make the font bigger when
you make handouts for weekly meetings.


718
00:50:20.058 --> 00:50:21.058
What's this?

719
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.478
Do you not want me
to see it or what?

720
00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:26.023
Just kidding. Come on.

721
00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:28.692
No, seriously.

722
00:50:28.775 --> 00:50:31.695
Ah, so Han, everyone's in a good mood.
Why not introduce yourself?


723
00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:32.821
Yes, sir.

724
00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:36.158
Uh, hello.

725
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:39.870
I'm Lee Han, I just got promoted
to a full-time employee here.


726
00:50:39.953 --> 00:50:41.580
I promise to give it my all!

727
00:50:41.663 --> 00:50:43.290
Applause.

728
00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:44.373
Nice.

729
00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:48.587
I think Han might need a mentor, you know,
to teach him the ropes around here.


730
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:50.380
Jiwoo can do it.

731
00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:51.964
Jiwoo.

732
00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:55.552
But she has a heavy workload this month.

733
00:50:55.635 --> 00:50:56.636
What about Soyeon?

734
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.596
Ah!

735
00:50:57.679 --> 00:50:59.306
Jiwoo always does a great job.

736
00:51:00.098 --> 00:51:03.268
Han, you can survive anywhere
if you learn from her.


737
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:05.771
- Yes, sir.
- Uh-huh.


738
00:51:07.981 --> 00:51:10.984
First, check the list
of Toi merchandise.


739
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:12.986
After that, forward the proposal

740
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.697
that we sent to the printers,
to the planning team.


741
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:19.242
And then, update the distributors list.

742
00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:20.326
Your legs.

743
00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:23.454
Update the list.

744
00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:19.427
Jiwoo.

745
00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:27.018
Sorry, but the formula,
it's not working in Excel.


746
00:52:27.102 --> 00:52:29.789
I hope you're not just saying that
after trying it only once.


747
00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:52.836
Jiwoo.

748
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.341
What was the third thing
you told me to do yesterday?


749
00:52:58.425 --> 00:53:01.136
You should record it from now on
if you can't remember.


750
00:53:15.567 --> 00:53:18.195
How could you send the report
in a group email?


751
00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:21.239
Do you think the CEO needs to read
your minutes from the meeting?


752
00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:23.491
- Look. You see this file?
- Yes.


753
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:25.827
You have to stick it in here.

754
00:53:25.911 --> 00:53:28.791
We checked the revisions
for the dubbing and now it's all ready.


755
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.833
I'll send the production sheet
and message the recording studio.


756
00:53:31.917 --> 00:53:34.586
Okay, let's not try
to fix it again and again.


757
00:53:34.669 --> 00:53:36.588
We don't have enough time for that.

758
00:53:36.671 --> 00:53:38.551
Okay,
I'll be sure to send a follow-up.


759
00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:42.177
Please stop that.

760
00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:48.557
Hi.

761
00:53:52.687 --> 00:53:53.772
It's tough, right?

762
00:53:54.856 --> 00:53:57.192
You can ask me
if you have any questions.

763
00:53:57.275 --> 00:53:58.275
What?

764
00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:01.905
Oh! No, I'm okay. Really.

765
00:54:01.988 --> 00:54:05.242
Everyone is worried about me
and says Jiwoo is scary.


766
00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:06.910
But that's good. I love that.

767
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:09.537
You love what?

768
00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:12.499
She tells it how it is.
Nothing with her is sugarcoated.


769
00:54:13.375 --> 00:54:15.001
When she sounds scary,

770
00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:16.544
it's kind of,

771
00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:18.046
sexy in a way.

772
00:54:18.129 --> 00:54:19.129
What did you say?

773
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:23.009
Well, I see.

774
00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:24.844
- Excuse me.
- Sure.


775
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:28.431
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

776
00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:31.643
Speaking of, I have to go
to a meeting with Jiwoo. I'll let you go.


777
00:54:31.726 --> 00:54:33.561
- Get back safe.
- Okay.


778
00:54:37.232 --> 00:54:39.943
<i>Jiwoo,
stop by the office before you go home.</i>


779
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:01.548
Mr. Jung?

780
00:55:15.937 --> 00:55:17.147
I sent it by mistake.

781
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:18.815
What was?

782
00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:24.946
The. Group. E. Mail.

783
00:55:28.116 --> 00:55:29.868
You can just resend it then.

784
00:55:31.578 --> 00:55:32.996
Is that really all?

785
00:55:33.079 --> 00:55:34.956
You're not my subordinate, are you?

786
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.750
But I belong to you, not him!

787
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:40.795
Mr. Jung, are you nervous right now?

788
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.881
I mean, you're clearly good at it.

789
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:45.258
But you act like Hans' master.

790
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.180
Well, this just won't do.

791
00:55:53.391 --> 00:55:55.477
<i>Initiating
and executing a perfect play</i>


792
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:58.938
<i>in an unexpected situation
without the help of toys,</i>


793
00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:01.941
<i>is the true duty
and qualification of a Dom.</i>


794
00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.114
Sit there.

795
00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:13.369
Undo your belt.

796
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:19.125
You can always take off your glasses
to stop this.


797
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:38.853
Take it off.

798
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.240
It's thicker than I expected.

799
00:56:58.873 --> 00:56:59.999
Mr. Jung,

800
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.586
you need to separate
your private life from work.


801
00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:47.172
You imagine these scenarios
and get jealous.


802
00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:50.216
How come you have
no faith in your master?

803
00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.857
Please, just hit me for real.

804
00:58:07.358 --> 00:58:10.236
What I did was wrong,
so you can hit me for real.


805
00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:12.739
It's humiliating,

806
00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.324
but still punish me.

807
00:58:14.407 --> 00:58:17.368
If you can't hit me,
you should step on me or curse at me.


808
00:58:17.952 --> 00:58:20.121
I want you to
at least curse at me.

809
00:58:25.251 --> 00:58:26.377
You little bitch.

810
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:28.504
What?

811
00:58:29.214 --> 00:58:30.924
What are you staring at, asshole?

812
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:33.801
How dare you look at me like that?

813
00:58:33.885 --> 00:58:34.886
Look down.

814
00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:40.892
You can't even fix a stupid coffee maker?

815
00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:44.312
Is there anything you can do right?
Is it because of your male ego?


816
00:58:44.395 --> 00:58:46.606
I'm sorry, Jiwoo. 
I'm very sorry.

817
00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:49.067
- No way. Come with me.
- Wha... Wait!


818
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.610
Can you do anything right?

819
00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:53.821
Is it too hard to review
the budget after I submit it? Is it?


820
00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:55.865
If you're going
to kill our efficiency like that,


821
00:58:55.949 --> 00:59:00.036
at least be polite and smile,
you ugly, stupid, little cockroach.


822
00:59:00.119 --> 00:59:02.121
Yes, I'm not even worthy of a cockroach.

823
00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:04.582
Why does
this damn copier keep breaking?


824
00:59:05.416 --> 00:59:07.043
You fucking asshole! Redo it!

825
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:29.524
Do you really think there's time
to write everything down?


826
00:59:29.607 --> 00:59:30.817
Just memorize it!

827
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.111
You're so frustrating, you stupid dumbass!

828
00:59:33.194 --> 00:59:34.654
Yes, I'm a stupid dumbass!

829
00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:36.656
And what is wrong with your finger?

830
00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:39.617
Why the hell do you have
to keep sending group emails?


831
00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:41.077
I'm sorry! Teach me one more ti...

832
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.121
Again? How many times must I teach you?

833
00:59:43.204 --> 00:59:46.082
All you have to do
is just think twice before you send it.


834
00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:47.292
Is that so hard?

835
00:59:47.375 --> 00:59:49.502
- Shithead!
- Shithead!


836
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:51.504
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.


837
00:59:53.798 --> 00:59:56.509
You piss me off like this back scratcher.

838
00:59:57.927 --> 00:59:59.178
You piece of shit.

839
01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.398
You ugly runt. 
You make me sick.

840
01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:13.860
And your dick is so tiny that
it's smaller than a chihuahua's.


841
01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:17.447
I'm a thousand times better at this job
than you are! Shit!


842
01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:19.949
Jiwoo.

843
01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.378
Is someone still here?

844
01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:28.684
How was that?

845
01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.020
I liked it.

846
01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:32.522
Me too.

847
01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:33.856
I got all excited.

Ah! I can clearly see that you're starting
to appreciate a good soup.


861

Mm-mm.

866
01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.785

was someone here last night?


867

You know what you did wrong, don't you?

873
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:40.334
No, I guess I don't.

874
01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.803
No? Then I'll tell you.

875
01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:47.652
HANA

876
01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:53.783
Do you still keep in touch?

877
01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:55.576
What?

878
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.453
Isn't that your ex-girlfriend?

879
01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:00.748
The one you told me about
while bawling.


880
01:06:05.836 --> 01:06:07.713
It's not that we keep in touch.

881
01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.257
She really hates my guts.

882
01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:12.718
Why does she hate you after dumping you?

883
01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:15.179
I mean, I get it.

884
01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:18.015
I was acting selfishly
by telling her the truth.


885
01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:21.018
Since I knew
it would've only made me feel better.


886
01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.856
Do you really enjoy
all this pain and suffering?


887
01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:29.193
It hurts...

888
01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.781
but I still feel so alive, you know?

889
01:06:35.282 --> 01:06:36.367
I don't get it.

890
01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.496
It's understandable.

891
01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:43.541
I mean, if it makes
the person you like feel more alive,


892
01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:45.584
why can't you do
it for them, you know?

893
01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.920
It's not like it's anything bad.

894
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.886
But I don't want to force it.

895
01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.597
That's why I'm so
happy that I have you.

896
01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:02.518
You seem to enjoy DS more
and more too.


897
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.022
Thank you again for today.

898
01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.774
I should go get cleaned up.

899
01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:25.583
<i>I can't believe
the things I did.</i>


900
01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.252
<i>But I can't forget about it either.</i>

901
01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:31.130
<i>The more I enjoy playing with him,</i>

902
01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.758
<i>the more I wonder
what we are outside of it.</i>


903
01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.719
<i>Is it normal to play this rough</i>

904
01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:38.471
<i>without it leading to sex?</i>

905
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.568
I'M HOME. WASHED UP AND IN BED NOW.
GOING TO WATCH TV AND SLEEP. GOOD NIGHT.


906
01:07:53.986 --> 01:07:56.906
<i>I can't tell you what's normal
and what's not.</i>


907
01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:59.742
<i>There are many couples
who have consensual sex,</i>


908
01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:03.454
<i>but as you know,
it's all on a case-by-case basis.</i>


909
01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.916
<i>What do you want?</i>

910
01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:08.793
<i>You should tell yourself that.</i>

911
01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.058
Hey, Woohyuk!

912
01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:26.560
Hi there.

913
01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:29.146
Why are you alone today?
Where's your boss?


914
01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:31.022
Uh...

915
01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.027
So she said she has a date
and she'll be late.


916
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.988
That's right,
something about a botanical garden?


917
01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.616
She's busy every weekend, huh?

918
01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:44.078
She says she has no boyfriend,
but she's always going on dates.


919
01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:47.706
Then why don't you
both go on a date?

920
01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:51.710
Uh... I didn't... No, I... I don't...

921
01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:52.794
It's not like that.

922
01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.297
Are you up for a morning run?

923
01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:58.050
What a good hobby.

924
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.511
Hyemi won't know if you don't tell her.

925
01:09:02.012 --> 01:09:03.722
Well, it's still a secret.

926
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:06.684
- See ya.
- Bye.


927
01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:08.894
Come on.

928
01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.498
HANA

929
01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:38.674
Hmm. Hana.

930
01:09:38.757 --> 01:09:41.844
Jihoo, stop pretending to be so busy.

931
01:09:41.927 --> 01:09:44.221
I'm not, our timing is just off.

932
01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:46.432
What do you need?

933
01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.725
<i>I'm in your neighborhood.</i>

934
01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:50.394
<i>My stomach hurts. 
Buy me noodle soup.</i>

935
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.856
I'm getting ready to go out right now.
I have some plans.


936
01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:55.274
Sorry.

937
01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:57.901
<i>Hana,</i>

938
01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:00.529
<i>let's talk some other time.</i>

939
01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:02.740
<i>I'm hanging up now.</i>

940
01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.118
Oh, is that right?

941
01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.369
Okay.

942
01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.791
He's such an asshole.

943
01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:29.934
ARBORETUM

944
01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.687
Maybe it's this nice weather?

945
01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:35.773
There sure seems to
be a lot of couples.

946
01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:37.024
Yeah, it does.

947
01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:39.109
I bet people see
us as a couple too.

948
01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:42.029
No way.
We're simply here to play a little.


949
01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.667
But, uh, then...

950
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.462
I order you
to stay next to me all day long.


951
01:10:58.545 --> 01:11:00.339
What? Even out there, you mean?

952
01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:01.422
Yeah.

953
01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:08.097
No matter what.
By my side until we return.


954
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.265
No matter...

955
01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:14.144
Okay, Jiwoo.

956
01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:15.728
In that case...

957
01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.317
I... I'm so sorry.

958
01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.952
I can wear it by myself.
Are you sure you're okay, Jiwoo?


959
01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.955
Don't talk back to me.
I'm only trying to be fair.


960
01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.838
PENGUIN, I'M AT THE PARKING LOT

961
01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:41.921
BE THERE SOON

962
01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:46.551
Well.

963
01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:48.846
Would you look at that.

964
01:11:49.346 --> 01:11:51.432
I'll get off. I'll get off here.

965
01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.977
Caught you red-handed, Jiwoo. Ha!

966
01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:03.610
Oh, Oh!

967
01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:06.155
She goes on a date
and can't even answer her phone.


968
01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:09.283
Ms. Penguin?

969
01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:12.036
Hi.

970
01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:58.207
Here are your two Iced Americanos.

971
01:12:58.290 --> 01:12:59.583
This is for you,

972
01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:02.044
and bacon sandwich for you, sir.

973
01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.255
Be strong.

974
01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:06.340
What?

975
01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:08.634
I said, "Be strong."

976
01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:09.760
Oh.

977
01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:11.053
I appreciate it.

978
01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:12.179
We got this!

979
01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:17.101
Why don't you come sit next to me?

980
01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:18.685
Oh, right.

981
01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.032
Okay, calm down.

982
01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:34.868
It's okay, I can do it myself.

983
01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:52.594
We have no choice.

984
01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:54.054
Ah, open.

985
01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.186
Ah.

986
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:03.439
Did you see them?

987
01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:05.524
Don't look.

988
01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:08.068
Are you jealous?

989
01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:08.986
Thank you.

990
01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.131
- Are you crazy?
- I'll feed you too.


991
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:12.555
- No way!
- Come on.


992
01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:14.741
- Stop. I said stop.
- Open wide.


993
01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.535
Just eat.

994
01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:19.579
Wow.

995
01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.748
She wiped his mouth.

996
01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:34.552
Mr. Jung.

997
01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.141
I wanted to ask you something.

998
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.560
What is it, Jiwoo?

999
01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:50.443
Wow.

1000
01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:55.407
Wow, not bad.

1001
01:14:57.784 --> 01:15:00.996
Wow. What an interesting place, huh?

1002
01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.710
Oh, what? Wait. Hold on.

1003
01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:09.004
Wh... why are you taking off your clothes?

1004
01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:10.589
Don't be coy.

1005
01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.382
I know you're excited too.

1006
01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.134
Well, we didn't agree to do this.

1007
01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:15.719
You like being forced, don't you?

1008
01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.263
Or you want me to hit you first?

1009
01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:28.481
So...

1010
01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:32.528
I like you, Mr. Jung.

1011
01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:40.118
Rather than being colleagues or partners...

1012
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.621
should we date?

1013
01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:46.458
Let's go out.

1014
01:15:48.001 --> 01:15:49.294
Let's try it.

1015
01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.378
That's an order.

1016
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.139
So I...

1017
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.978
Sorry!

1018
01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.771
Ow!

1019
01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:09.439
Are you okay? Your... your head!

1020
01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:11.525
Are you okay? I'll wipe that!

1021
01:16:11.608 --> 01:16:12.609
What is that?

1022
01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:15.862
- Oh, they're wearing handcuffs.
- Are those handcuffs.


1023
01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:19.629
- What's going on?
- Why don't we get a pair too?


1024
01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:23.495
- Come on, let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it!


1025
01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:27.374
Stop, General, 
I mean, master.

1026
01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:28.750
I've prepared something.

1027
01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:32.754
Oh, well, you didn't need to.

1028
01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.257
Ta-da.

1029
01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:37.718
Bondage. We can use it in bed.

1030
01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:40.387
This isn't what I imagined.

1031
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.180
Let's go and take this off first.

1032
01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:44.056
No.

1033
01:16:45.183 --> 01:16:47.227
We'll try it again in a safer setting.

1034
01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:50.147
Let's just take it off for now.

1035
01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:55.986
It's not that.

1036
01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.657
No, Jiwoo. I...

1037
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.202
I don't think we should date.

1038
01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:07.246
I'm sorry.

1039
01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:17.674
<i>Hyemi?</i>

1040
01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:24.348
It's fate that we met
in the Paju SM Theme Motel, in Room 506.


1041
01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.933
We can't just wing our first ever play.

1042
01:17:27.017 --> 01:17:28.017
Even if I'm the Sub,

1043
01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.521
don't you think a rape play is too much
when we've only just met?


1044
01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:35.692
It's not like you're a rapist
or a fake BDSMer, right?


1045
01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:37.569
So, what do you want, huh?

1046
01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:40.139
<i>Hyemi? What are you talking about?</i>

1047
01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:41.281
<i>Where are you?</i>

1048
01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:42.574
<i>Hyemi!</i>

1049
01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:44.408
<i>Hyemi!</i>

1050
01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:47.245
Hey, what is this?

1051
01:17:48.538 --> 01:17:51.166
<i>Paju SM, Room 506!</i>

1052
01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:52.834
We have to go and help her now!

1053
01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:55.796
- What?
- Son of a bitch!


1054
01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:04.179
Be careful.

1055
01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:13.772
No, the key!

1056
01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:15.649
Jiwoo, we need to leave first.

1057
01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:21.071
It's close. Make a right soon.

1058
01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:24.241
Hyemi, are you okay?

1059
01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.034
It's Jiwoo!

1060
01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:27.285
Are you inside?

1061
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:30.871
Hyemi!

1062
01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:33.375
You're too late.

1063
01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:34.793
See?

1064
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:38.880
If you're gonna join them,
you have to pay extra, okay?


1065
01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:42.676
Are you okay?

1066
01:18:42.759 --> 01:18:43.802
Did I scare you?

1067
01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:45.595
You totally got me now.

1068
01:18:46.346 --> 01:18:47.889
Uh, I'll explain later.

1069
01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:51.893
- Let's go.
- Don't you think we should call the cops?


1070
01:18:52.644 --> 01:18:54.312
Hold on.

1071
01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.527
Just because I'm a pervert,

1072
01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:03.238
doesn't give you the right to mistreat me.

1073
01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:07.117
And by the way,
I got a picture of you all tied,


1074
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.411
so don't even bother trying anything.

1075
01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:27.053
Mmm! Shit! That fucking perv.

1076
01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:32.350
When I posted online,
I literally got more than 50 requests.


1077
01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.019
Half of them are total idiots

1078
01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.521
who basically would message
any girl with tits.


1079
01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.315
The others didn't care what I wanted.

1080
01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:40.942
They just sent me pictures
of their dick right away!


1081
01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.740
You know what pisses me off even more?

1082
01:19:46.823 --> 01:19:50.368
That I know there's no use
going to the police for this shit.


1083
01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.038
And I didn't take
that jerks picture back there.


1084
01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.456
Why not?

1085
01:19:54.539 --> 01:19:55.373
Because...

1086
01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:58.543
...then I'd be
no better than those assholes.


1087
01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:06.927
I hear there are a lot of fake Doms
who only care about having sex right away.


1088
01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:09.429
Those freaking assholes.

1089
01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:12.682
They probably
don't even know anything about DS.


1090
01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:15.310
Huh?

1091
01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:17.687
So you're the dog-hater then?

1092
01:20:19.105 --> 01:20:20.105
What?

1093
01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:21.942
It's nice to meet you.

1094
01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:23.944
He's very cute.

1095
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.573
- Jeez, eyes forward when you drive, okay?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.


1096
01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.657
Yeah.

1097
01:20:29.699 --> 01:20:31.034
Right.

1098
01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:32.369
He is cute.

1099
01:20:49.886 --> 01:20:51.179
<i>Let's go out.</i>

1100
01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.599
<i>That's an order.</i>

1101
01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:56.142
<i>No, Jiwoo. I...</i>

1102
01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:58.854
I don't think we should date.

1103
01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:03.566
I'm sorry.

1104
01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:13.660
WHAT I SAID EARLIER

1105
01:21:17.497 --> 01:21:18.497
MR. JUNG

1106
01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.670
Crazy bitch.

1107
01:21:30.176 --> 01:21:32.512
ONE WEEK BEFORE CONTRACT EXPIRATION

1108
01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.204
<i>Hey, Jihoo. Stop!</i>

1109
01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:02.000
What kind of crazy bullshit
are you saying?


1110
01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:03.667
Well,

1111
01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:06.212
we bite
and hit each other once in a while.


1112
01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:08.256
And so, it's like that, you know?

1113
01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:10.425
You like it too, I think.

1114
01:22:10.508 --> 01:22:12.302
That's just me showing affection.

1115
01:22:12.385 --> 01:22:14.429
It's totally different
from doing sex stuff.


1116
01:22:14.512 --> 01:22:15.512
What?

1117
01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.516
I think maybe you should see a therapist.

1118
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.393
Were you abused as a kid?

1119
01:22:21.978 --> 01:22:23.730
No, this is just who I am.

1120
01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:25.857
I thought a lot about this

1121
01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:28.109
because I wanted
to be completely honest with you now.


1122
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.193
Honest?

1123
01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:31.780
Then what was everything
you've done with me?


1124
01:22:31.863 --> 01:22:32.989
Was that all a lie?

1125
01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:35.867
So this whole time, you weren't excited,

1126
01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:39.204
but you forced yourself? Is that it?

1127
01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:41.039
I didn't force myself, Hana.

1128
01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:44.125
You never should've told me.

1129
01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.128
You're disgusting.

1130
01:23:19.619 --> 01:23:20.787
<i>Hmm.</i>

1131
01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:23.999
I can understand where he's coming from.

1132
01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:28.003
Some people do end up dating
their Dom/Sub partner.


1133
01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:30.505
Sounds great, right?

1134
01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:32.215
But it's not as easy as you think.

1135
01:23:32.882 --> 01:23:35.176
Commanding and obeying is love too.

1136
01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.430
But you can't base love on that alone.

1137
01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:39.723
I know.

1138
01:23:41.307 --> 01:23:43.893
And you know the thing that's
the most humiliating?


1139
01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:47.147
The absolute confidence I had.

1140
01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:48.897
Sure.

1141
01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.735
Because I was certain he would say yes.

1142
01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:54.904
Because he liked obeying me.

1143
01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:00.452
I'm just like those fake Doms.

1144
01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:03.872
- Boss.
- Hmm?


1145
01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:12.762
This will make sure
it doesn't scar.


1146
01:24:12.797 --> 01:24:13.797
You know.

1147
01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:21.097
Hey, don't hit on me.
If I were to go out with you at my age...


1148
01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:22.390
I would love it.

1149
01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:25.392
Gosh.

1150
01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:30.440
It doesn't have to be me,
but please don't go out with those freaks.


1151
01:24:30.523 --> 01:24:32.734
All sorts of freaks
are fine but not you.

1152
01:24:32.817 --> 01:24:33.902
Don't argue with me.

1153
01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.321
Go. Go on.

1154
01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:39.866
Go, go, go, go!

1155
01:24:42.368 --> 01:24:44.329
And you're not a fake.

1156
01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.289
At least you really tried, right?

1157
01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.839
Thank you for putting in so much thought
into the small budget project.


1158
01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.049
I really appreciate it.

1159
01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:57.592
No, don't mention it.

1160
01:24:57.675 --> 01:25:00.303
Not like we're at different companies.
We need each other.


1161
01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:03.348
Mr. Jung, keep following up, okay?

1162
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.808
- Yes, sir.
- Good.


1163
01:25:05.475 --> 01:25:06.475
Hey,

1164
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.646
what brand are your glasses?
Can I try them on?


1165
01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:12.065
Okay. Forget it then.

1166
01:25:12.148 --> 01:25:14.567
I only asked you
because I need to buy new ones.


1167
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.862
- Gosh, even I feel awkward.
- No, sir. I...


1168
01:25:18.404 --> 01:25:21.825
I just always have to keep my glasses on.
They're like my lucky charm.


1169
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:26.496
You're a lot more superstitious
than I expected, aren't you?


1170
01:25:26.579 --> 01:25:28.915
Wow, I like this human side of you.

1171
01:25:28.998 --> 01:25:30.458
Be understanding, Ms. Choi.

1172
01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:35.796
Jiwoo.

1173
01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:37.757
Is there anything wrong?

1174
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:38.841
What?

1175
01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:40.635
Uh, no.

1176
01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:47.308
I drank too much last night.

1177
01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.978
Even my gallbladder hurts
so much right now.


1178
01:25:56.359 --> 01:25:59.070
What was that?
Are things awkward right now?


1179
01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.823
I thought you guys
were getting along so well.


1180
01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:13.435
<i>- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!</i>


1181
01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:14.878
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!


1182
01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:19.114
- Let's go to the lamb place.
- Yes!


1183
01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.814
- Or do you want something else?
- No, that's fine.


1184
01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:27.265
Thank you very much.
Have a great weekend.


1185
01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:28.600
Thank you, you too.

1186
01:26:46.117 --> 01:26:46.993
Mr. Jung.

1187
01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.286
Yeah?

1188
01:26:49.245 --> 01:26:50.455
Have a nice weekend.

1189
01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:09.390
<i>We'll do our final play tomorrow
as discussed.</i>


1190
01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.301
Oh.

1191
01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.767
<i>Bondage
is the epitome of SM play.</i>


1192
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:54.310
<i>It has a higher level of difficulty</i>

1193
01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:56.771
<i>because you must consider
the quality of the rope,</i>


1194
01:27:56.854 --> 01:28:00.233
<i>how tight to tie it,
which knots to make, and so on.</i>


1195
01:28:00.316 --> 01:28:02.735
<i>The person who is tied up feels euphoric</i>

1196
01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:06.614
<i>and free from the tingliness that comes
from the restriction of blood flow.</i>


1197
01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.200
<i>Feeling free from
the moment they are bound</i>


1198
01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:11.202
<i>is the paradox of pain.</i>

1199
01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:14.956
<i>Because of it's high level of difficulty,
it's hard to predict the results.</i>


1200
01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:38.688
You idiot,

1201
01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:40.440
you don't even ask, "Who is it?"

1202
01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.405
Are you drunk, Hana?

1203
01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:48.865
You should've called first.

1204
01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:50.742
You didn't pick up.

1205
01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.577
Not today.

1206
01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.331
My boyfriend and I broke up.

1207
01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:59.667
Did you fight again?

1208
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.380
My friends won't listen
to me talk about this anymore.


1209
01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:07.550
I feel I can
talk to you, though, right?

1210
01:29:07.633 --> 01:29:10.011
Hana, I can listen to you.

1211
01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:11.929
But not now.

1212
01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:13.973
Because

1213
01:29:14.932 --> 01:29:17.101
you know deep down that you owe me.

1214
01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:19.771
Because, you know

1215
01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.565
that you can never really
pay me back for this.


1216
01:29:25.318 --> 01:29:26.819
You're so obvious.

1217
01:29:30.656 --> 01:29:31.908
Listen,

1218
01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:33.868
I'm sorry about everything,
but not today...


1219
01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:35.495
You're disgusting.

1220
01:29:36.287 --> 01:29:37.622
You can't just do that.

1221
01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:40.208
You have no right to look put out.

1222
01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.291
I can't do it.

1223
01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:45.046
Seeing you live a normal life
like everything's fine annoys me.


1224
01:29:47.298 --> 01:29:49.258
How can I possibly live normally?

1225
01:29:50.301 --> 01:29:52.929
You've burned me so bad
I'm scared to do anything, let alone date.


1226
01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:54.514
I can't either.

1227
01:29:54.597 --> 01:29:56.682
I'm scared to go out with a guy
because of you too.


1228
01:29:57.266 --> 01:30:00.269
Shit. Can't you imagine
how much you hurt me?


1229
01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:02.980
Well, I was hurt too, Hana.

1230
01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:05.858
You may not understand at all,

1231
01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:09.904
but for me to never be accepted
for who I was not for a moment...


1232
01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:12.740
that hurt too.

1233
01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.411
And now I'm realizing that...

1234
01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:21.165
there might not be anything wrong with me.

1235
01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.395
JUNG JIWOO

1236
01:31:07.336 --> 01:31:08.336
I'll leave.

1237
01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:12.091
But I can promise you this one thing.

1238
01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:14.510
You'll never be able to love anyone

1239
01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:17.555
because you won't give up anything.

1240
01:31:19.348 --> 01:31:22.059
And, so in the
end, you're all you've got.

1241
01:31:59.263 --> 01:32:00.556
<i>You saw her, didn't you?</i>

1242
01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:02.641
Hana.

1243
01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:05.561
Are you back together with her?

1244
01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:07.230
No, of course not.

1245
01:32:08.731 --> 01:32:10.566
She still hates me.

1246
01:32:15.238 --> 01:32:16.781
You don't hate someone

1247
01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:19.367
if you don't like them.

1248
01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.633
Does that hurt?

1249
01:33:27.018 --> 01:33:28.185
Say the word.

1250
01:33:29.353 --> 01:33:30.896
I can do much more than that.

1251
01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:48.623
Since this is our final play,

1252
01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:50.833
let's have no regrets tonight.

1253
01:34:17.568 --> 01:34:19.612
Stop it, Jihoo!

1254
01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:25.785
Sorry, but I don't
think I can do this.

1255
01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:34.794
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

1256
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:42.550
I'm sorry.

1257
01:34:46.472 --> 01:34:47.848
What are you sorry for?

1258
01:35:24.468 --> 01:35:25.468
Jiwoo.

1259
01:35:27.596 --> 01:35:30.141
Do you know why Mercury
is small and black?


1260
01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:33.728
It's too close to the Sun.

1261
01:35:34.603 --> 01:35:37.606
So it shriveled up and burned.

1262
01:35:39.942 --> 01:35:41.318
I like warmth...

1263
01:35:43.154 --> 01:35:45.364
but I'm always afraid of getting burned.

1264
01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:48.743
Because...

1265
01:35:50.202 --> 01:35:51.370
you're my sun.

1266
01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:55.374
The first that I've ever met.

1267
01:35:57.126 --> 01:35:58.586
The one and only.

1268
01:36:03.716 --> 01:36:05.509
Let's end the final play here.

1269
01:37:11.283 --> 01:37:14.829
We have one less mouth to feed.
Jiwoo actually took a sick day.


1270
01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:16.705
So she is human after all.

1271
01:37:16.789 --> 01:37:18.332
I thought she was a robot.

1272
01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:20.584
Iced Americano.

1273
01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:22.419
Thank you, Han.

1274
01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:23.963
- Put it on my desk.
- Yes, sir.


1275
01:37:32.054 --> 01:37:34.640
Sir Jung, you're not wearing them today?

1276
01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:36.141
Hmm?

1277
01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:38.727
Your glasses. You know,
your precious good luck charm.


1278
01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:43.190
I'm jealous that you have something
so important to you.


1279
01:37:55.578 --> 01:37:57.913
Why'd you make me porridge?
You didn't have to.


1280
01:38:00.082 --> 01:38:01.417
It's store bought.

1281
01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:04.879
Okay. It tastes good.

1282
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.590
Eat up, and go back to sleep.

1283
01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:16.849
What now? What?

1284
01:38:16.932 --> 01:38:18.642
I didn't say anything.

1285
01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.019
It's with your eyes.

1286
01:38:22.354 --> 01:38:25.357
They say we don't have any control
over our hearts, you know?


1287
01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:28.152
Don't kick yourself, okay?

1288
01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:46.045
Goodness!

1289
01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.091
Jeez.

1290
01:38:51.175 --> 01:38:54.261
I think I might have complicated
Jiwoo's entire life.


1291
01:38:55.387 --> 01:38:58.724
She's just a normal person.
I shouldn't have asked her to do that.


1292
01:38:58.807 --> 01:39:01.435
What an overinflated ego.

1293
01:39:02.019 --> 01:39:03.979
That was all Jiwoo's choice.

1294
01:39:06.565 --> 01:39:08.692
Do you know how
hard she thought about it?

1295
01:39:10.527 --> 01:39:12.613
She refused to ask
you to have a beer

1296
01:39:12.696 --> 01:39:16.075
because she was afraid
it would be an abuse of work power.


1297
01:39:16.575 --> 01:39:19.578
Seriously,
she's so old-fashioned.


1298
01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.456
She was cool from the get-go.

1299
01:39:23.916 --> 01:39:26.126
That's what attracted me to her, you know?

1300
01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:32.424
Is that as a man talking or BDSMer?

1301
01:39:32.508 --> 01:39:34.760
At first, I was sure, but...

1302
01:39:34.843 --> 01:39:38.263
- Uh-huh?
- But now, I can't differentiate.


1303
01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:41.308
I'm really pathetic, aren't I?

1304
01:39:43.602 --> 01:39:45.270
You are.

1305
01:39:46.689 --> 01:39:47.982
I'm a mess too.

1306
01:39:49.358 --> 01:39:50.943
And yet, so are you.

1307
01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:55.322
Does anything get better
if you hate yourself day in, day out?


1308
01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:57.032
If you have that time,

1309
01:39:57.908 --> 01:40:00.411
try taking responsibility
for your feelings.


1310
01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:22.849
Okay.

1311
01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:29.439
What?

1312
01:40:34.319 --> 01:40:36.405
<i>Jiwoo, be careful.</i>

1313
01:40:37.072 --> 01:40:40.159
<i>There are many people in this world
who wouldn't understand.</i>

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:12.816
smarter than everyone else.

What are you gonna do now?

1325
01:41:15.944 --> 01:41:16.945
Answer me!

1326
01:41:17.029 --> 01:41:19.907
That bastard Han
isn't coming in, huh? Did he quit?


1327
01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:23.243
- And why isn't Mr. Jung here yet?
- He's here.

What's going on?

1329
01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:29.333
- Go to the conference room.
- Nothing's been confirmed. Okay.


1330
01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.752
People keep posting
on the anonymous forum.


1331
01:41:31.835 --> 01:41:34.963
Send out a notice.
Anyone who shares it will be punished.


1332
01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:36.649
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.


1333
01:41:36.673 --> 01:41:39.760
How humiliating.
The PR team of all places.


1334
01:41:42.137 --> 01:41:43.180
Come inside.

1335
01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:45.224
I HEARD ABOUT IT.
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT?


1336
01:41:45.307 --> 01:41:48.644
I MEAN, FREEDOM OF CHOICE,
BUT AT THE LOUNGE OF ALL PLACES?


1337
01:41:49.228 --> 01:41:52.147
I guess Jung Jiwoo,
that woman can't work here anymore.


1338
01:41:52.231 --> 01:41:54.316
Who do you think is the perv,
him or her?


1339
01:41:54.399 --> 01:41:56.527
The woman follows the man's lead.

1340
01:42:00.155 --> 01:42:03.158
How could you like being hit?
Do they get off on the pain?


1341
01:42:03.242 --> 01:42:05.369
Do you want to know?
Want me to hit you too?


1342
01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:08.330
Shut it,
or you'll get belt-whipped too.


1343
01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:12.876
HIT ME HOT AND SEXY.
YOU ARE DIRTY.


1344
01:42:17.756 --> 01:42:19.550
MR. JUNG JIHOO

1345
01:42:26.056 --> 01:42:27.808
<i>The person
you're trying to reach</i>


1346
01:42:27.891 --> 01:42:29.768
<i>can't come to the phone right now.</i>

1347
01:42:29.852 --> 01:42:31.436
<i>Please try again later.</i>

1348
01:42:38.527 --> 01:42:42.531
I'm Jiwoo's colleague. Her phone
is sending me straight to voicemail.


1349
01:42:43.365 --> 01:42:44.950
Are you just a colleague?

1350
01:42:45.033 --> 01:42:46.033
What?

1351
01:42:46.618 --> 01:42:49.204
If you are, then she would've answered.

1352
01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:06.930
<i>If it weren't for me,</i>

1353
01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:12.186
you wouldn't be going through
this pain and humiliation, Master.


1354
01:43:13.478 --> 01:43:14.688
It's all my fault.

1355
01:43:16.773 --> 01:43:18.650
Even as I blame myself like this,

1356
01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:23.906
when I think about the fact that
people found out about my deepest secret,


1357
01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:26.116
I just want to run away
and hide somewhere.


1358
01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:28.410
I'm really pathetic, aren't I?

1359
01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:40.797
Jiwoo.

1360
01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:18.877
We'll begin
the disciplinary hearing.


1361
01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.131
<i>Sit there.</i>

1362
01:44:24.466 --> 01:44:25.550
<i>Undo your belt.</i>

1363
01:44:29.179 --> 01:44:30.179
<i>Take it off.</i>

1364
01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:34.476
<i>It's thicker than I expected.</i>

1365
01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:37.145
<i>Please, just hit me for real.</i>

1366
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:38.605
Enough.

1367
01:44:41.692 --> 01:44:42.692
What exactly...

1368
01:44:44.361 --> 01:44:45.821
is your relationship?

1369
01:44:46.905 --> 01:44:50.325
Why were you taking off your clothes
and then hitting each other at the office?


1370
01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:53.829
The problem was that we broke the rules
regarding the place of business.


1371
01:44:53.912 --> 01:44:55.622
It's not about our personal lives.

1372
01:44:55.706 --> 01:44:57.582
We have to investigate

1373
01:44:57.666 --> 01:45:01.837
that personal life to know exactly what
and how much you've violated.


1374
01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.505
We're not a regular company!

1375
01:45:04.214 --> 01:45:06.800
What if it gets posted
on a forum for moms?


1376
01:45:08.468 --> 01:45:09.468
Jiwoo...

1377
01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:13.307
I guess you're dominant at night then?

1378
01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:17.602
Was that funny?

1379
01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:20.439
Just be honest with us.

1380
01:45:20.522 --> 01:45:23.317
We don't want to make this
a bigger deal than it needs to be, either.


1381
01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.193
We'll just say in our report
that a young man


1382
01:45:25.277 --> 01:45:27.446
and a woman in a relationship
got carried away.


1383
01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:31.074
Yes. Why don't you pursue
a cleaner relationship now?


1384
01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:33.452
Or is that not exciting enough, Jihoo?

1385
01:45:33.952 --> 01:45:36.496
Well, sure, it might feel like
too much to actually date.


1386
01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.874
They could've been
a friends with benefits situation.


1387
01:45:38.957 --> 01:45:39.957
True.

1388
01:45:40.375 --> 01:45:41.375
Well,

1389
01:45:42.085 --> 01:45:46.506
It's exciting the first few times
to listen to a woman ordering you around,


1390
01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:48.710
but if that continues,
it will only degrade the man...


1391
01:45:48.759 --> 01:45:51.428
You do realize that your comments
can be quite problematic


1392
01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:52.637
to many people, right?

1393
01:45:52.721 --> 01:45:55.557
My gosh,
you really are as amazing as I've heard.


1394
01:45:56.266 --> 01:46:00.145
You didn't do anything more than that
in the employee lounge, did you?


1395
01:46:00.228 --> 01:46:02.397
Yes, let's make that clear. 
Did you or no?

1396
01:46:03.648 --> 01:46:06.443
You'll regret
what you're saying right now.


1397
01:46:07.152 --> 01:46:08.945
- I don't like...
- That's enough!


1398
01:46:10.822 --> 01:46:13.658
I kept asking her to punish me.
Jiwoo did nothing wrong.


1399
01:46:14.242 --> 01:46:17.746
We'll be the ones who decide
whether or not she did something wrong.


1400
01:46:18.622 --> 01:46:22.000
Anyway, all this started
with your talk of tendencies, right?


1401
01:46:22.667 --> 01:46:27.089
Yes. I'm the type of person that likes
being ordered around and stepped on.


1402
01:46:27.172 --> 01:46:29.591
This all happened because of me,
so stop with your debates.


1403
01:46:29.674 --> 01:46:31.176
Mr. Jung, Doong-doong.

1404
01:46:31.259 --> 01:46:33.261
Respectfully,
I'm not listening to you today.


1405
01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:34.971
- What was that?
- Doong-doong.


1406
01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:37.057
Doong-doong? Is that a code?

1407
01:46:37.599 --> 01:46:39.309
Whatever.

1408
01:46:39.393 --> 01:46:40.769
Let's get this straight,

1409
01:46:40.852 --> 01:46:44.106
Mr. Jung has
no romantic feelings for Jiwoo.


1410
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:45.482
You just like being stepped on.

1411
01:46:46.274 --> 01:46:49.694
So, Jiwoo, do you like Mr. Jung
or do you just like hitting him?


1412
01:46:49.778 --> 01:46:51.530
Let's make this clear.

1413
01:46:52.447 --> 01:46:54.825
No, sir. I...

1414
01:46:57.452 --> 01:46:58.286
want Jiwoo.

1415
01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:02.707
Mr. Jung, you really shouldn't be say...

1416
01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:05.460
I actually like her,
and I do want to go out with her.


1417
01:47:05.961 --> 01:47:08.630
So I don't want to just sit here
and listen to this.


1418
01:47:08.713 --> 01:47:10.006
So he does like her.

1419
01:47:10.632 --> 01:47:12.634
Still, you need to be disciplined.

1420
01:47:12.717 --> 01:47:16.471
Whether you discipline me or fire me,
It's important I say this.


1421
01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:21.101
Yeah, sure, whatever. I'm a freak
and I ended up causing this mess.


1422
01:47:21.893 --> 01:47:23.395
But Jiwoo is different.

1423
01:47:24.646 --> 01:47:28.275
To be honest, everyone here other than her
seems like a total nut job.


1424
01:47:29.151 --> 01:47:32.571
Jiwoo was carrying out the task
I asked of her fully and responsibly.


1425
01:47:32.654 --> 01:47:34.114
She's amazing and capable.

1426
01:47:34.197 --> 01:47:35.782
That's why I fell for her.

1427
01:47:37.159 --> 01:47:38.285
Is that so wrong?

1428
01:47:39.369 --> 01:47:40.370
Is that a rule too?

1429
01:47:42.497 --> 01:47:46.460
You're the ones overstepping boundaries
left and right, acting rude to our face!


1430
01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:51.923
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

1431
01:47:56.219 --> 01:47:57.219
Jiwoo...

1432
01:47:59.014 --> 01:48:02.017
I know I have
the worst timing as usual...

1433
01:48:04.394 --> 01:48:05.394
but I like you.

1434
01:48:06.062 --> 01:48:08.356
Forget the contract
and disciplinary action.


1435
01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.566
As a colleague,

1436
01:48:10.567 --> 01:48:13.778
a human being, and a man,
I respect and like you.


1437
01:48:16.615 --> 01:48:19.326
I like you even more than
you can ever imagine.


1438
01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:25.040
So much.

1439
01:48:31.838 --> 01:48:33.381
Shh!

1440
01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:36.218
It's still public indecency!

1441
01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:40.722
Okay. Well then,
I guess we've been indecent.


1442
01:48:40.805 --> 01:48:43.850
We'll be indecent only outside
of the office.


1443
01:48:44.476 --> 01:48:45.977
No more questions, right?

1444
01:48:46.978 --> 01:48:48.522
And no regrets, I hope.

1445
01:48:58.782 --> 01:49:00.784
You didn't have to go that far.

1446
01:49:03.828 --> 01:49:06.206
You're cool when you're tough,
and pretty when you smile.


1447
01:49:06.289 --> 01:49:07.874
You're just so perfect, Jiwoo!

1448
01:49:08.416 --> 01:49:10.752
Am I not pretty if I don't smile?

1449
01:49:10.835 --> 01:49:14.089
Are you kidding me right now?
How could you not be pretty?


1450
01:49:14.172 --> 01:49:15.840
You're so frustrating.

1451
01:49:17.926 --> 01:49:21.304
You've become very arrogant
now that our contract is over.


1452
01:49:21.930 --> 01:49:23.515
Maybe we should renew it?

1453
01:49:26.309 --> 01:49:29.521
You don't have to do anything
if it's too hard for you.


1454
01:49:31.439 --> 01:49:32.983
There you go again.

1455
01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:35.986
Don't be making assumptions.

1456
01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:39.030
I always like doing things
that push my boundaries.


1457
01:49:39.698 --> 01:49:42.158
And it was kind of fun.

1458
01:49:44.494 --> 01:49:45.662
Let's do both.

1459
01:49:46.538 --> 01:49:48.290
- DS.
- And dating?


1460
01:49:48.373 --> 01:49:50.041
Let's rewrite the contract,

1461
01:49:50.125 --> 01:49:51.835
so Mercury won't get burned.

1462
01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:54.462
This makes it worth getting fired.

1463
01:49:54.546 --> 01:49:57.215
We still have to see
whether or not we are.


1464
01:49:58.133 --> 01:49:59.134
What?

1465
01:50:00.802 --> 01:50:03.346
ANONYMOUS

1466
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.932
<i>Mr. Hwang,
when are we going away together?</i>


1467
01:50:06.016 --> 01:50:08.852
<i>Mmm,
you don't need to call me "Mister."</i>


1468
01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:11.062
<i>You know my wife
has been sensitive lately.</i>


1469
01:50:11.146 --> 01:50:16.109
<i>Wanna take a business trip to Busan
and get mackerel sashimi, baby?</i>


1470
01:50:16.192 --> 01:50:18.695
You've got to be kidding me.

1471
01:50:20.363 --> 01:50:23.116
<i>Sir, I'll get
the hottest girls around the entire of...</i>


1472
01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.493
Hey, what was that?

1473
01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:26.995
It was sent in a group chat.

1474
01:50:27.078 --> 01:50:28.955
In a group chat? Are you crazy? Wh...

1475
01:50:29.039 --> 01:50:31.416
Han, Jiwoo wants to see you.

1476
01:50:31.499 --> 01:50:32.709
Oh, okay.

1477
01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:36.046
<i>I'm sure we weren't
the only ones being recorded that day.</i>


1478
01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:41.426
<i>Please, just hit me for real.</i>

1479
01:50:41.509 --> 01:50:43.720
No way. Come with me.

1480
01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:47.557
Mr. Hwang,
when are we going away together?


1481
01:50:48.558 --> 01:50:51.186
I'm terribly sorry
for what I put you through,


1482
01:50:51.269 --> 01:50:52.937
but I'm worried that I'll get in trouble.

1483
01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:54.648
Aren't you going to quit anyway?

1484
01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:57.650
Then help me.

1485
01:50:58.652 --> 01:50:59.986
Suspension?

1486
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:01.780
They get paid
during suspension?


1487
01:51:01.863 --> 01:51:03.103
They'll cover this up...

1488
01:51:03.198 --> 01:51:04.616
JUNG JIHOO
SIX-MONTH SUSPENSION


1489
01:51:04.699 --> 01:51:06.076
JUNG JIWOO
THREE-MONTH PAY CUT


1490
01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:08.495
<i>We lost
too many people all at once.</i>


1491
01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:11.289
Take charge of the events on-site
for the time being.


1492
01:51:11.373 --> 01:51:12.791
That's your punishment.

1493
01:51:13.583 --> 01:51:14.583
Okay.

1494
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:18.546
Or are you going to quit
because it's a lot of work?


1495
01:51:19.047 --> 01:51:20.047
I might.

1496
01:51:20.590 --> 01:51:22.092
Okay.

1497
01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:31.601
<i>No relationship
is perfectly equal in this world.</i>


1498
01:51:31.685 --> 01:51:33.144
<i>- Probably.</i>
- Coming.


1499
01:51:33.228 --> 01:51:37.357
<i>But we can try to be as equal as we can
until our dying breath.</i>


1500
01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.441
You like it?

1501
01:51:40.026 --> 01:51:41.361
Going on another date?

1502
01:51:41.945 --> 01:51:44.072
I'll go out with
you after I close up.

1503
01:51:45.907 --> 01:51:47.534
- Oh!
- No, no, James.


1504
01:51:47.617 --> 01:51:49.077
- Stop it.
- Hyemi!


1505
01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:51.413
Hyemi? I'm your boss, huh?

1506
01:51:53.289 --> 01:51:57.669
<i>Dom or Sub,
S or M, we're all searching for someone</i>


1507
01:51:57.752 --> 01:52:00.672
<i>who will accept us as we are
behind the mask.</i>


1508
01:52:02.841 --> 01:52:06.052
<i>The unique love that you may find
if you don't give up.</i>


1509
01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:09.764
<i>If you meet someone like that,</i>

1510
01:52:09.848 --> 01:52:13.143
<i>it may be worth enduring
a little change in your life.</i>


1511
01:52:16.354 --> 01:52:18.773
Is it really your wish to be bit?

1512
01:52:19.691 --> 01:52:22.193
Well, kissing, hugging,
I like all of that, you know?


1513
01:52:22.277 --> 01:52:25.572
But I like moving very slowly,

1514
01:52:25.655 --> 01:52:27.532
one base at a time. Slowly.

1515
01:52:29.451 --> 01:52:33.079
So I'm guessing, what?
This is first base for you?


1516
01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:35.247
Yes.

1517
01:52:39.043 --> 01:52:40.211
Oh.

1518
01:52:51.222 --> 01:52:52.222
Jiwoo.

1519
01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.019
<i>We decided to try
a romantic DS relationship</i>


1520
01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:58.438
<i>I wanted to let you know, 
Femme Femme.</i>

1521
01:52:58.521 --> 01:52:59.564
<i>Thank you.</i>

1522
01:53:01.858 --> 01:53:04.194
<i>Congratulations
on meeting someone like that.</i>


1523
01:53:04.944 --> 01:53:07.155
<i>I wish you luck
on your DS relationship</i>


1524
01:53:07.238 --> 01:53:08.615
<i>as well as your love.</i>

1525
01:53:27.801 --> 01:53:29.969
You're cute normally too,

1526
01:53:30.053 --> 01:53:33.473
but I think you're even cuter
when you're tied up like this.


1527
01:53:33.556 --> 01:53:35.683
Then you should
keep tying me up like this.


1528
01:53:36.810 --> 01:53:38.520
I'll have to see about that.

1529
01:53:39.687 --> 01:53:43.650
But today, I won't untie you
until I'm more than satisfied.


1530
01:53:53.076 --> 01:53:56.287
Okay, trying to take the easy way out?
