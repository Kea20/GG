<i>Purrpetual Petz</i>
<i>are just like real pets,</i>

10
00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.187
<i>except that when you talk to</i>
<i>them, they actually talk back.</i>

11
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.723
Amazeballs!

12
00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.625
<i>There's over</i>
<i>six different Petz to collect,</i>

13
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:32.459
<i>each equipped with</i>
<i>their own personalities</i>

14
00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.161
<i>and entirely</i>
<i>spontaneous reactions!</i>

15
00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.129
Careful. That's my butt.

16
00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:37.865
<i>They speak</i>

17
00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.835
<i>They can take pictures.</i>

18
00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:42.570
Come on, sweetheart,
find the lens.

19
00:01:42.604 --> 00:01:44.204
<i>And with the customized app,</i>

20
00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:45.506
<i>you can even feed your friend.</i>

21
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.307
<i>But not too much.</i>

22
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:49.777
Uh-oh. Cleanup on aisle seven.

23
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:51.613
<i>The app is updated</i>
<i>with new content daily,</i>

24
00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:53.514
<i>so you can do</i>

25
00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:55.717

26
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.385

28
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.895
Mmm. Jelly berries
makes me feel good.

29
00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.931
Cady, look.

30
00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.566
We're almost
at the top of the mountain.

31
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.934
Can you see the hotel?

32
00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.235
Oh, well, that's interesting.

33
00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.738
Do you know what else
is interesting?

34
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.239
Oopsie-daisy.

35
00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.842
I thought we were
gonna limit screen time

36
00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:22.209
to 30 minutes a day.

37
00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.645
Well, what are you
telling me for?

38
00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:25.245
-I didn't give it to her.
-I'm just saying, I think--

39
00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.648
Cady, can you
turn it down, please?

40
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:28.482
I need to go to the bathroom.
Are we there yet?

41
00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.250
I think if we make rules,
we need to stick to them.

42
00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.451
Look, if she wasn't on that,

43
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:32.920
she'd be climbing
all over the seats.

44
00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:34.522
Oh, so you would
rather she sat there

45
00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.624
feeding a toy virtual food
until it shits itself?

46
00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:39.661
-Cady, turn it down.
-I already did turn it down.

47
00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:41.529
-What was Gemma thinking?
-She was thinking,

48
00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:43.463
"It's my niece's birthday.
I'm gonna get her a present."

49
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.700
She works for
the company that makes them.

50
00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.935
She probably didn't even
have to pay for shipping.

51
00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.971
Honestly, what is
the purpose of a toy

52
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:52.372
if you have to play with it
on an iPad?

53
00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:53.941
This is what the future
looks like, okay?

54
00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:56.410
Just have to get used to...

55
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.747
-Oh, my God!
-And away we go!

56
00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:01.281
It's all right.
We're all right.

57
00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.884
We should've put chains
on the car.

58
00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:04.619
Yeah, neither of us knew
that was a thing until like

59
00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.554
ten minutes ago, okay?
Don't act like it's my fault.

60
00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.289
Oh, my God! Ryan! Seriously!

61
00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.692
Wh-What?
What do you want me to do, huh?

62
00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:11.959
Mom, I dropped Leroy.

63
00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:13.393
Why did you tell
that guy at the gate

64
00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:14.729
that this was
a four-wheel drive?

65
00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.296
-Help me, Cady.
-Because I thought it was.

66
00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.699
It looks like
a four-wheel drive.

67
00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.499
Cady, what are you doing?

68
00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:20.702
-Cady? Cady?
-Cady, put your seat belt on!

69
00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:21.368
Jesus Christ!

70
00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.940
-I can't see anything.
-So stop moving forward.

71
00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:27.307
Oh, my...

72
00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.444
We can't just sit
in the middle of the road.

73
00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:33.681
Look, we'll wait
for this to clear

74
00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:36.450
and then find someplace
where we can pull over

75
00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:39.319
and just wait for one of those
snow trucks to clear the road.

76
00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.822
Yeah, how long is
that gonna take?

77
00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:07.280
Funki,
a toy company for the future.

78
00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:10.885
Remember, the key to fun
is Funki.

79
00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:48.689
-Why are we doing this?
-Because we have to.

80
00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:50.490
If we could at least show him
what we have, he would...

81
00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:52.794
No, mm-mm.
You said so yourself.

82
00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:55.563
Not until she's ready.

83
00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.297
Hey.

84
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.503
Is that what I think it is?

85
00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:29.697
Transparency looks good.

86
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.567
Yeah, well, for what
we paid for it, it better.

87
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.869
Okay, here we go.

88
00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:36.403
Happy.

89
00:05:37.872 --> 00:05:38.840
Okay.

90
00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:40.608
Sad.

91
00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.979
-Confused.
-Wait, wait. Stop.

92
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:46.479
Why is her face doing that?

93
00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:48.448
What is happening?

94
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.750
I-I don't know, Gemma.
It's your code.

95
00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:51.619
Yeah, thanks.
I know it's my code, Cole,

96
00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.386
but she doesn't look confused.

97
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.523
-She looks demented.
-What do you want me to do?

98
00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:56.724
You want me to take
the skin back off?

99
00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:58.926
Well, she's not responding.
So...

100
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.761
Okay, here we go.

101
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.599
-Oh, shit. It's stuck.
-Just be care-- Just be care--

102
00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:06.133
-Hey, don't tear it.
-I know.

103
00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:07.602
I'm not gonna tear-- Ow.

104
00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:09.503
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

105
00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:11.438
Shit.

106
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.640
Okay, so what do we do?

107
00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:14.876
I guess
we got to open the door.

108
00:06:19.113 --> 00:06:21.448
Gem.

109
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.852
What in the name
of ever-loving Christ is this?

110
00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.687
David, if you just give me
a minute to explain...

111
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:28.421
Is this why you moved your lab
down here, Gemma?

112
00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:29.790
So you can keep secrets from me?

113
00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:31.626
No, no, no. We-we talked
about this, David. I...

114
00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.161
Yeah, we talked about
you putting it on ice

115
00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:35.495
until you had a new Petz model.

116
00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.464
How much did you spend on this?

117
00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:40.635
Are you even aware
of the shit tsunami

118
00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:42.703
that just swept in
over this Furzeez spot?

119
00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:43.905
I'm sorry, what?

120
00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:49.543

121
00:06:49.577 --> 00:06:51.545

-I'm sorry.

127
00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:01.522
Are we supposed to be worried
about that? It's a rip-off.

128
00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:03.524
You're right, Gemma.
It is a rip-off.

129
00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:05.526
They do the exact same thing
we do.

130
00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.061
And you know what else?

131
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:08.663
They do it for half the price!

132
00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:11.799
I told you
we needed to go simpler.

133
00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:12.767
Didn't I tell her?

134
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.970
Six months ago,
I begged you, I begged you

135
00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:17.738
to please give me an option

136
00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:19.807
I can put on a shelf
for 50 bucks.

137
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.575
And we are working on it.
I promise.

138
00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:23.077
-Yeah.
-But, David, the only way

139
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.246
to stay ahead of the
competition is to come up with

140
00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.148
toys that are too advanced
to replicate.

141
00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:29.083
I know the tech on Petz seems

142
00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.918
more complex than it needs
to be, but that's only because

143
00:07:30.952 --> 00:07:32.954
I was using it as a launchpad
for something bigger.

144
00:07:32.987 --> 00:07:35.923
In each Pet,
we installed a listening model

145
00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:38.491
that targets conversational
patterns among kids.

146
00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:40.094
You did not just tell me that.

147
00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:42.863
Look, I know she doesn't look
like much now, but I promise,

148
00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:44.665
if you just let us
show you what M3gan

149
00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:46.968
is capable of,
you will realize that this is

150
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:48.169
what we've been working towards.

151
00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.236
"Megan"?

152
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.540
"Model 3 Generative Android."

153
00:07:52.573 --> 00:07:54.008
"M3gan" for short.

154
00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:57.878
-Tess, load up
the intro simulation. -Now?

155
00:07:57.912 --> 00:07:59.080
Yeah.

156
00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:02.116
M3gan, say hi to David.

157
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:03.818
As in the boss David?

158
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.053
Well, I guess
I should call you Dad.

159
00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:09.123
Allow me to tell you

160
00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.257
a little bit about my wormhole.

161
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:11.892
I was born in a sandwich shack,

162
00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:13.894
and I wolf many cabbages.

163
00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:15.262
Uh...

164
00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:16.731
This isn't supposed
to happen, obviously.

165
00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.265
Just give me one moment.

166
00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.267
Sorry about the noise.

167
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.269
-Gem?
-Uh, one second, Cole.

168
00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:23.704
It's probably just
a race condition.

169
00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:25.072
It'll literally take me
a minute to fix.

170
00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:26.841
Gem, it's not a race condition.

171
00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.577
I might have forgotten to put
in the polypropylene barrier.

172
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.745
-David.
-Oh, no.

173
00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:32.146
-God.
-Tess, turn it off!

174
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.548
I can't.

175
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.097
I want the Petz prototype
on my desk by Friday.

176
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:54.602
And I want you
to take this cyborg puppet show

177
00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:58.039
and put it in a dark closet
where it belongs!

178
00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:05.846
And I want a swipe card
for this door!

179
00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:13.954
For what it's worth, I thought
she looked really cool.

180
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.949
Cady, it's gonna be
okay, all right?

181
00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:43.784
We're gonna take care of you.

182
00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:45.953
I just need to check
your blood pressure.

183
00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:47.021
It'll be all right.

184
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:48.722
Radiology, pick up line four.

185
00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:49.757
Do you want another blanket?

186
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.358
I can get you a warm one.

187
00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:53.828
So this is to grant you
temporary protective custody.

188
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:57.098
Just sign your name
and date it at the bottom.

189
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.367
Thank you.

190
00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:02.236
Now, I don't know
if your sister had

191
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.105
a family lawyer already,
but if not,

192
00:10:04.138 --> 00:10:07.074
it would be something
to consider moving forward.

193
00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:03.898
Hey! Hey! Hey! Celia!

194
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:06.967
Could you please keep your dog
on your side of the fence?

195
00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:09.236
I just spent 80 bucks
on a shock collar.

196
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.405
Maybe try cranking it up
a notch.

197
00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:12.907
Ah. Who's this little lady?

198
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.842
That is my niece, Cady.

199
00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:16.443
-She staying for the
weekend? -Um, you know what?

200
00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:18.412
It's been a really long drive,

201
00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:21.715
and, um, I would just
really appreciate it

202
00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:22.917
if you did not have your dog

203
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.351
running onto my yard
all the time.

204
00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:27.121
And also,
don't spray your chemicals

205
00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:28.455
-onto my driveway, please.
-Ah, shit.

206
00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:29.990
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:31.725
You want to borrow this
once I'm done?

208
00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:32.927
No, I don't want to borrow it.

209
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.228
I don't want to spend
my afternoon

210
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:35.863
getting your sediment
off of my driveway.

211
00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.265
-Just hang a tarp or something.
-Okay.

212
00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:45.072
Welcome home, Gemma.

213
00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:47.208
You have
six unanswered voice messages

214
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:49.276
-and five Tinder notifications.
-Elsie, turn off.

215
00:11:51.412 --> 00:11:53.113
Sorry about that.

216
00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:58.219
Okay.
I'm gonna put these bags away.

217
00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:02.156
And, um, just make yourself
at home. Okay?

218
00:12:16.538 --> 00:12:19.039
Oh, those aren't toys, Cady.

219
00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:21.976
I mean, yeah, technically,
yeah, they're toys.

220
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:24.144
They're just, um, collectibles,

221
00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:25.946
so you don't actually
play with them.

222
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.182
That probably sounds
really weird.

223
00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:29.383
Um...

224
00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:33.420
I'm trying to think
if I have anything...

225
00:12:33.454 --> 00:12:35.557
Oh. What happened
to the Purrpetual Pet

226
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.192
I got you for your birthday?

227
00:12:39.527 --> 00:12:43.030
It's okay. I was just looking.

228
00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:50.070
I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

229
00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:55.142
but, um, we will make it
feel cozy somehow, I promise.

230
00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:01.215
There.

231
00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:10.791
Look...

232
00:13:13.294 --> 00:13:17.565
...I know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now.

233
00:13:17.599 --> 00:13:20.034
I just want you to know that
I'm gonna do everything I can

234
00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:22.336
to make this place
feel like home.

235
00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.471
And, um,

236
00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:29.109
if you need anything, I'm
just gonna be down the hall.

237
00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.379
Okay? Really close.

238
00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:35.617
You're not gonna
read me a story?

239
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.585
What's up?

240
00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:41.288
Mom always read me a story
before bed.

241
00:13:41.322 --> 00:13:43.157
Oh. Um...

242
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.125
I don't, I don't think
I really have

243
00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:47.529
any kids' books here
right now, Cady.

244
00:13:47.562 --> 00:13:49.396
Um, but that's okay.

245
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.299
I can download one on my phone.

246
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:54.435
That's fine.

247
00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:57.137
-It's just...
-Oh.

248
00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.908
I just have to update the app.

249
00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:53.927
I can't believe
this is happening.

250
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:55.597
I'm not equipped to handle this.

251
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.165
I don't even take care
of my own plants.

252
00:14:58.198 --> 00:14:59.433
Have you heard from
Ryan's parents?

253
00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:01.034
Yeah, they called
and offered to help,

254
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:02.302
but, like, they live in Florida.

255
00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:03.237
They're kind of weird.

256
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.572
I don't know what their deal is.

257
00:15:04.606 --> 00:15:06.006
I don't--
I'm just trying to figure out

258
00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:07.408
a way to do this
without getting fired.

259
00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:09.343
David's gonna shit blood
if I ask for more time off.

260
00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:12.680
Yeah, I-I know, but, Jesus,
Gem, you just lost your sister.

261
00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:15.416
And we spent $100,000
of company funds

262
00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:17.317
on a product
that he didn't even ask for.

263
00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:19.420
If we don't get this
Petz prototype to him soon,

264
00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:20.988
he's going to sue us.

265
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.690
Okay, I don't think you can be

266
00:15:22.724 --> 00:15:24.358
worrying about work
right now, Gem.

267
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:27.027
Right now, I think
you just need to focus on Cady.

268
00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:30.197
Hold on.

269
00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:36.170
-Hi.
-Hi.

270
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:38.472
I'm Lydia.

271
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.542
Oh! The therapist?

272
00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:42.309
Sorry, yeah.

273
00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.244
Please come in.

274
00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:49.584
And you must be Cady.

275
00:15:49.617 --> 00:15:52.119
Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas.

276
00:15:52.152 --> 00:15:53.655
Yeah, we were just watching TV.

277
00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:55.489
I see that.

278
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.462
So, how does this work?

279
00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:03.598
I just need to observe
the two of you together

280
00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:05.299
for half an hour,
40 minutes or so.

281
00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:07.000
Oh. Okay.

282
00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:08.469
Doing what, exactly?

283
00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:10.738
Oh, just hanging out.

284
00:16:10.772 --> 00:16:13.508
Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game.

285
00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:15.743
Hey, Cady, do you want to run
and grab some toys to play with?

286
00:16:15.777 --> 00:16:17.344
I don't have any toys here.

287
00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:18.613
I just unpacked a bunch
this morning.

288
00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:20.113
I think they're just old.

289
00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:21.616
I don't think
she plays with them anymore.

290
00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:24.218
-What about these ones up here?
-Those aren't toys.

291
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:25.653
They're Aunt Gemma's
collectibles.

292
00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:27.087
You're not supposed
to play with them.

293
00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:30.023
That's okay.

294
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.125
We can play with them.

295
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:33.494
We can totally play with them.

296
00:16:33.528 --> 00:16:35.630
Do you want to play with them?

297
00:16:35.663 --> 00:16:37.498
You want to play-- Yeah.

298
00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:38.800
Play with it. No big deal.

299
00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:05.259
There's a lever you have
to pull on the bottom...

300
00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:07.662
Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,

301
00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:09.363
we might let Cady lead.

302
00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:10.765
Yeah, I'm just explaining
how it works.

303
00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:12.165
Well, it's a toy.

304
00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:14.334
I'm sure it's not
that complicated.

305
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.804
That's great, Cady.

306
00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:19.373
Do you want to roll it
to Aunt Gemma?

307
00:17:22.677 --> 00:17:25.078
It's just that this is not
what it was designed to do.

308
00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:26.380
It does other things.

309
00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:30.685
But, yeah, totally.

310
00:17:30.718 --> 00:17:33.555
Let's just roll it on
the ground like a tennis ball.

311
00:17:33.588 --> 00:17:35.590
Let's do that instead.

312
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:44.164
Uh, we'll do a few more
sessions with Cady initially,

313
00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:45.567
but that can happen
at your office or school.

314
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.702
Oh, yeah. I haven't had time
to look into that yet.

315
00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:51.405
Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it's on my list.

316
00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:55.375
Sorry, can I just ask, how
close were you and your sister?

317
00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:58.846
Oh. I don't know.

318
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.448
But you wanted this, right?
To take custody?

319
00:18:01.481 --> 00:18:03.350
Yeah, of course.

320
00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.319
Okay, because
the father's parents have said

321
00:18:05.352 --> 00:18:06.721
they're willing to take her
if you feel it's too much.

322
00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:09.189
-Wait, did they contact you?
-It's no big deal, Gemma.

323
00:18:09.222 --> 00:18:10.592
They're just trying
to be supportive.

324
00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:12.192
If Nicole wanted Cady
to go to Jacksonville,

325
00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.628
she would have said so.

326
00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:15.630
But even so, I need to make
my own recommendations

327
00:18:15.663 --> 00:18:17.899
to the court as to whether
or not this is a safe space,

328
00:18:17.932 --> 00:18:20.400
so you're gonna need to make

329
00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:23.337
one or two adjustments
in order for this to work.

330
00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:26.473
Okay.

331
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:50.197
Listen, Cady, um,

332
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.234
I have this project at work
that's kind of overdue,

333
00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:56.638
and with all the time that
I had to take off last week,

334
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:59.507
I'm not really sure
I'm gonna get it done.

335
00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:05.513
Anyway, it's not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours,

336
00:19:05.546 --> 00:19:08.650
but if you could just
hold down the fort by yourself

337
00:19:08.683 --> 00:19:12.185
for a little while,
that would help me so much.

338
00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:14.622
You can use my iPad if you want.

339
00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:18.760
You can FaceTime a friend
or play a game or something.

340
00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:20.394
What about screen time?

341
00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:21.562
Hmm?

342
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.431
How long before
I have to turn it off?

343
00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:26.768
Oh, I don't care.
As long as you want.

344
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:29.336
I mean, I'm not
gonna be gone that long.

345
00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:30.672
I'll just be down the hall.

346
00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:33.541
And, uh, when I'm done,
we can go out somewhere.

347
00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:36.944
We can go to a playground or...

348
00:19:36.978 --> 00:19:39.881
get something to eat.

349
00:19:39.914 --> 00:19:41.448
Okay?

350
00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:14.749
Cady?

351
00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:20.487
Oh, Cady, I'm sorry.

352
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:21.689
Come here.

353
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.831
I'm not off to
a very good start here, am I?

354
00:20:31.766 --> 00:20:33.835
What is this?
Did you draw a picture?

355
00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:36.738
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

356
00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:38.005
I'm still working on it.

357
00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:39.473
Tell me.

358
00:20:39.507 --> 00:20:41.008
It was actually supposed to be

359
00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:42.910
-a different animal
for each head. -Mm-hmm.

360
00:20:42.944 --> 00:20:45.580
-Like, this one was
supposed to be a tiger. -Mm.

361
00:20:45.613 --> 00:20:47.815
And this one was
supposed to be a grizzly bear,

362
00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:49.984
-but I can never seem
to get the fur right. -Mm.

363
00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:51.919
It's hard. I can relate.

364
00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:55.623
I've actually been working with
some furry creatures myself.

365
00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:57.925
Do you want to see?

366
00:20:57.959 --> 00:20:59.627
Yeah?

367
00:21:00.862 --> 00:21:02.329
So we're working on a version

368
00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:03.430
of the Purrpetual Pet
that's cheaper.

369
00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:05.900
We still want it to be fun.

370
00:21:05.933 --> 00:21:08.770
So, what do you think?

371
00:21:11.639 --> 00:21:13.373
Yeah.

372
00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:14.976
What's that?

373
00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:16.911
Oh.

374
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.311
That's Bruce.

375
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:20.447
Is he a toy?

376
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.683
Yeah, kinda.
He's a proxy robot.

377
00:21:22.717 --> 00:21:25.052
I built him
when I was in college.

378
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.056
-Why doesn't he have a face?
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

379
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.359
It's a pretty obvious
design flaw.

380
00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:35.328
Okay, hold on.
Let's see what we have.

381
00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:41.936
Let's see about this.

382
00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:44.105
How's that?

383
00:21:44.138 --> 00:21:46.306
Would you maybe want
to talk to him?

384
00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:48.643
Yes.

385
00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:50.678
Okay.

386
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.559
Hey, Cady. What's up?

387
00:22:04.592 --> 00:22:07.460
Give me five.

388
00:22:09.864 --> 00:22:11.799
Oh, come on.
You can do better than that.

389
00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:15.970
Ouch, girl. Not so hard.

390
00:22:16.003 --> 00:22:17.872
How does he work?

391
00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.842
Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out.

392
00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:22.977
I won't get freaked out.

393
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.345
Okay.

394
00:22:28.115 --> 00:22:30.785
Let's see what we've got here.

395
00:22:31.752 --> 00:22:35.122
Okay.
These are stereoscopic cameras.

396
00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:37.490
That is a laser. That's radar.

397
00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:40.127
These are bump sensors,
so he can tell the difference

398
00:22:40.161 --> 00:22:41.863
between a human
and a hard surface.

399
00:22:41.896 --> 00:22:45.967
And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go.

400
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.702
-It's his brain?
-Yeah.

401
00:22:47.735 --> 00:22:50.504
And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell.

402
00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:52.540
I can't believe you made this.

403
00:22:52.573 --> 00:22:54.474
Yeah. He's pretty cool.

404
00:22:54.508 --> 00:22:55.877
But the problem
with toys like Bruce

405
00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.144
is that they're so expensive,

406
00:22:57.178 --> 00:22:59.580
and most kids
can't afford to have one.

407
00:22:59.614 --> 00:23:01.148
If I had a toy like Bruce,

408
00:23:01.182 --> 00:23:03.918
I don't think I'd ever need
another toy again.

Okay, so we've got this one
or the one with the bangs.

417
00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:55.736
A little bit of an auburn chic.

418
00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.838
I really think, you guys,
you got to revisit this.

419
00:23:57.872 --> 00:24:00.440
-Uh, no. Absolutely not.
-Look at that.

420
00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:06.981
-Oh, just a second...
-No, no, no, no, no.

421
00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:10.084
Sh...

422
00:24:10.117 --> 00:24:12.485
What is this? Where's Gemma?

423
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.955
Where's my prototype?

424
00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:16.657
Uh, David, I just want to be
e-exceedingly clear

425
00:24:16.691 --> 00:24:19.026
that this was not my idea.

426
00:24:27.034 --> 00:24:29.737
Cady, there's someone
I want you to meet.

427
00:24:31.305 --> 00:24:33.975
Do you remember
how much you liked Bruce?

428
00:24:34.008 --> 00:24:36.544
I think you're gonna
like M3gan even more.

429
00:24:36.577 --> 00:24:41.115
You see, Bruce requires
someone else to operate him,

430
00:24:41.148 --> 00:24:44.484
but M3gan works all on her own.

431
00:24:45.286 --> 00:24:48.255
Okay, what I want you to do

432
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:50.591
is take your fingers
and put them here.

433
00:24:50.624 --> 00:24:53.627
And when you do that,
you're gonna pair with her.

434
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:56.130
That means she will recognize
you as her primary user.

435
00:24:56.163 --> 00:24:58.733
She's yours and yours alone.

436
00:24:58.766 --> 00:25:02.970
So just keep your fingers there
and say your name.

437
00:25:04.138 --> 00:25:06.607
Hi, M3gan. I'm Cady.

438
00:25:08.175 --> 00:25:10.811
It's nice to meet you, Cady.

439
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:17.918
Ooh, I like that jacket.
Where'd you get it?

440
00:25:19.186 --> 00:25:22.023
I'm not sure. I can't remember.

441
00:25:22.056 --> 00:25:25.159
Oh. Well, anyway,
it looks good on you.

442
00:25:25.192 --> 00:25:26.927
Do you want to hang out?

443
00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:31.532
Okay.

444
00:25:52.353 --> 00:25:54.188
Shall we draw?

445
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:56.290
What are you going to draw?

446
00:25:56.323 --> 00:25:58.793
See if you can guess.

447
00:26:21.115 --> 00:26:23.250
There's nothing there.

448
00:26:23.284 --> 00:26:25.753
Oh, I'm sorry.

449
00:26:44.171 --> 00:26:46.807
Do you like it, Cady?

450
00:26:49.009 --> 00:26:50.945
I love it.

451
00:26:50.978 --> 00:26:52.947
Jesus.

452
00:26:55.349 --> 00:26:58.052
This is incredible.

453
00:26:58.085 --> 00:27:00.354
I mean...

454
00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:03.124
this is unbelievable, isn't it?

455
00:27:03.157 --> 00:27:04.892
Yeah, it is.

456
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.395
How did you do this?

457
00:27:08.429 --> 00:27:09.864
I thought
you didn't want to know.

458
00:27:09.897 --> 00:27:11.732
That wasn't a simulation, right?

459
00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:13.100
That kid's not an actress?

460
00:27:13.134 --> 00:27:14.869
No, that's my niece, Cady.

461
00:27:14.902 --> 00:27:16.137
Okay, we need to get this
in front of the board.

462
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.405
-I was just gonna say...
-But first things first.

463
00:27:18.439 --> 00:27:20.841
Let's talk manufacturing costs.

464
00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:23.010
More or less than a Tesla?

465
00:27:23.043 --> 00:27:24.078
Um...

466
00:27:25.446 --> 00:27:26.881
Depends on the model, I guess.

467
00:27:26.914 --> 00:27:29.416
Okay, I'm in. I'm all in.

468
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.886
But we're gonna be asking the
board to invest in something

469
00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:33.988
that's not gonna see a profit
for three years.

470
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:36.957
So bottom line is, this isn't
going anywhere without Greg.

471
00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:39.293
-He's the chairman.
-Yeah, I know who Greg is, Kurt.

472
00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:42.163
Now, Greg is a hard-ass when
it comes to spending money.

473
00:27:42.196 --> 00:27:43.831
But here's the thing.

474
00:27:43.864 --> 00:27:46.167
He's got a kid who's about
the same age as your niece.

475
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.969
If we can show him
what you just showed me

476
00:27:49.003 --> 00:27:50.771
and get him
to respond emotionally

477
00:27:50.804 --> 00:27:53.807
instead of analytically,
we should be off to the races.

478
00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:55.910
So, can we keep the girl?

479
00:27:55.943 --> 00:27:57.178
Can we make her part of it?

480
00:27:57.211 --> 00:27:58.913
I mean,
she's paired with her, right?

481
00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:00.214
That's how
this whole thing works?

482
00:28:00.247 --> 00:28:01.916
Yeah, the more time
she spends with Cady,

483
00:28:01.949 --> 00:28:03.184
the more effective
she's gonna be.

484
00:28:03.217 --> 00:28:05.186
Love it.
Kurt, get Shelley on the phone.

485
00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:07.755
Gem, get me a list of things
I can say in a presentation

486
00:28:07.788 --> 00:28:09.456
that makes it sound like
I know what I'm talking about.

487
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.325
Holy shit, this is exciting.

488
00:28:11.358 --> 00:28:12.927
I want you all
to remember this moment.

489
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.863
The moment we kicked Hasbro
right in the dick.

490
00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:21.802
<i>The new</i>
<i>Model 3 Generative Android</i>

491
00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:24.205
<i>from Funki is a fully autonomous</i>
<i>humanoid robot</i>

492
00:28:24.238 --> 00:28:28.042
<i>with features never before seen</i>
<i>in the consumer market.</i>

493
00:28:28.075 --> 00:28:29.910
And over here are all of
Aunt Gemma's collectibles,

494
00:28:29.944 --> 00:28:32.079
and this one is
my favorite and-- Oh!

495
00:28:32.112 --> 00:28:33.914
I have more awesome toys
in my room. Come on. Come on.

496
00:28:33.948 --> 00:28:36.951
<i>Sculpted from a titanium core,</i>

497
00:28:36.984 --> 00:28:39.920
<i>M3gan's designed to withstand</i>
<i>whatever life can throw at her.</i>

498
00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:42.990
<i>She comes equipped with</i>
<i>an A17 bionic fusion chip</i>

499
00:28:43.023 --> 00:28:44.892

501
00:28:47.261 --> 00:28:49.797
<i>But the most exciting aspects</i>

502
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.332

508
00:29:03.578 --> 00:29:05.412
Cady, you should use a coaster.

509
00:29:05.446 --> 00:29:07.014
Why do I have to use a coaster?

510
00:29:07.047 --> 00:29:08.916
Coasters help
to avoid water marks,

511
00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:10.317
especially on wooden surfaces.

512
00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:13.921
But how does the water
get outside the glass?

513
00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:15.889
That's a great question, Cady.

514
00:29:15.923 --> 00:29:17.958
It's actually caused by
the difference in temperature

515
00:29:17.992 --> 00:29:20.528
outside the glass, which
pulls moisture from the air.

516
00:29:20.562 --> 00:29:21.862
Crazy.

517
00:29:21.895 --> 00:29:23.998
It's insane, right?

518
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:25.466
<i>Studies indicate that</i>

519
00:29:25.499 --> 00:29:27.901
<i>a staggering</i>
<i>78% of a parent's time</i>

520
00:29:27.935 --> 00:29:29.937
<i>is spent dishing out</i>
<i>the same basic instructions.</i>

521
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.171
Oh, my God.

522
00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:33.374
Cady, you have to flush
the toilet.

523
00:29:33.407 --> 00:29:34.842
It is not that hard.

524
00:29:34.875 --> 00:29:35.909
<i>So we found someone else</i>

525
00:29:35.943 --> 00:29:37.211
<i>to pick up the slack.</i>

526
00:29:37.244 --> 00:29:38.546
Cady, flush the toilet.

527
00:29:41.115 --> 00:29:42.182
Wash your hands.

528
00:29:43.217 --> 00:29:45.185
Roll up your sleeves.

529
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:48.956
Great job.

530
00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:50.291
It was my friend
Jenny's birthday, and...

531
00:29:50.324 --> 00:29:52.126
<i>M3gan's an excellent listener.</i>

532
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:53.561
And this guy told them that
the 13th floor was haunted.

533
00:29:53.595 --> 00:29:55.329
-Uh-huh. Right.
-And they accidentally...

534
00:29:55.362 --> 00:29:56.531
<i>And she even has</i>

535
00:29:56.564 --> 00:29:58.265
<i>a few stories of her own.</i>

536
00:29:58.299 --> 00:29:59.933
"'If it was so, it might be;

537
00:29:59.967 --> 00:30:01.335
"'and if it were so,
it would be;

538
00:30:01.368 --> 00:30:02.870
"'but as it isn't, it ain't.

539
00:30:02.903 --> 00:30:04.038
"That's logic,'

540
00:30:04.071 --> 00:30:05.439
said Tweedledee."

541
00:30:05.472 --> 00:30:07.374
<i>She'll never run out of ways</i>

542
00:30:07.408 --> 00:30:08.876
<i>to keep your child occupied,</i>

543
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:11.011
<i>and she'll never</i>
<i>run out of patience.</i>

544
00:30:11.045 --> 00:30:14.148
Cady, seriously,
flush the toilet.

545
00:30:22.956 --> 00:30:24.224
<i>With M3gan around,</i>

546
00:30:24.258 --> 00:30:26.193
<i>she'll take care</i>
<i>of the little things,</i>

547
00:30:26.226 --> 00:30:29.363
<i>so you can spend more time</i>
<i>doing the things that matter.</i>

548
00:30:30.632 --> 00:30:32.600
And then it can end
with something like,

549
00:30:32.634 --> 00:30:34.335
"M3gan.
She's more than just a toy.

550
00:30:34.368 --> 00:30:37.071
-She's part of the family."
-Looks good.

551
00:30:37.104 --> 00:30:39.239
-You're not gonna do the voice,
though, right? -No.

552
00:30:39.273 --> 00:30:41.308
Obviously, David's gonna
make up his own version of it.

553
00:30:41.342 --> 00:30:44.078
I just want him to be aware of
what it is that he's selling.

554
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:47.615
Tess, your silence
indicates what?

555
00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:49.517
I-I don't know.

556
00:30:49.551 --> 00:30:51.485
-I'm not sure.
-About what?

557
00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:53.921
Well, why would you want M3gan
to do all that stuff?

558
00:30:53.954 --> 00:30:55.222
They're emergent capabilities.

559
00:30:55.255 --> 00:30:57.124
She'll be able to do
all of that and more.

560
00:30:57.157 --> 00:30:59.627
Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?

561
00:30:59.661 --> 00:31:02.029
I mean, I thought
we were creating a tool

562
00:31:02.062 --> 00:31:03.497
to help support parents,
not replace them.

563
00:31:03.531 --> 00:31:06.233
--I mean, if you're
having M3gan tuck Cady in

564
00:31:06.266 --> 00:31:08.369
and read her a bedtime story,
then when are you ever

565
00:31:08.402 --> 00:31:10.270
spending time with her
or even talking with her?

566
00:31:10.304 --> 00:31:13.240
I don't really think
this is any of your business.

567
00:31:13.273 --> 00:31:16.076
Well, it is.

568
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.078
If you're spending less time
with your child

569
00:31:18.112 --> 00:31:20.180
as a result of M3gan,
that is something

570
00:31:20.214 --> 00:31:23.183
-we should be aware of.
-She's not my child.

571
00:31:25.687 --> 00:31:27.087
Look, you know how hard

572
00:31:27.121 --> 00:31:28.523
I've been working
on this presentation.

573
00:31:28.556 --> 00:31:30.190
As soon as it's over and
the board agrees to proceed,

574
00:31:30.224 --> 00:31:31.992
then we can establish
some kind of balance.

575
00:31:32.025 --> 00:31:33.994
But for now, it's important
that Cady and M3gan spend

576
00:31:34.027 --> 00:31:35.262
as much time
as possible together.

577
00:31:35.295 --> 00:31:36.263
And by the way,

578
00:31:36.296 --> 00:31:38.065
I don't think it's having
detrimental effects,

579
00:31:38.098 --> 00:31:39.333
because she's the happiest
she's been

580
00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:40.635
since her parents died.

581
00:31:40.668 --> 00:31:42.169
How did Cady's parents die?

582
00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:44.438
-Whoa. -I thought
she was turned off.

583
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:46.306
Yeah, M3gan, turn off.

584
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.941
Cady James,

585
00:31:47.975 --> 00:31:49.977
daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James,

586
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.412
killed in a collision
on Interstate 84

587
00:31:51.445 --> 00:31:52.946
outside of Oregon.

588
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.281
Why is she doing that?

589
00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:56.083
Shit, she's still
paired with Cady.

590
00:31:56.116 --> 00:31:58.018
You didn't code in
parental controls?

591
00:31:58.051 --> 00:31:59.654
I didn't have time to implement
them before we went live.

592
00:31:59.687 --> 00:32:01.021
Hold on.

593
00:32:01.054 --> 00:32:02.356
M3gan, if you have
data requests,

594
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:04.291
you have to engage
with the protocols.

595
00:32:04.324 --> 00:32:06.059
I don't have a framework
to speak with Cady

596
00:32:06.093 --> 00:32:07.294
on the subject of death.

597
00:32:07.327 --> 00:32:09.029
Yes, I know.
We're looking into it.

598
00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:10.998
Gathering auxiliary
Internet data on death.

599
00:32:11.031 --> 00:32:12.232
I meant at a later point.

600
00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:14.168
Calculating
its vector representation.

601
00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:16.203
Death is the end of life.

602
00:32:16.236 --> 00:32:17.672
-Holy shit.
-The total and permanent

603
00:32:17.705 --> 00:32:19.473
cessation of
all vital functions.

604
00:32:19.507 --> 00:32:21.709
Yes, but let's not make
a big deal out of it.

605
00:32:21.743 --> 00:32:23.143
Everything dies.

606
00:32:23.778 --> 00:32:25.479
Will I die?

607
00:32:25.513 --> 00:32:27.749
Actually, let's just avoid
this topic altogether.

608
00:32:27.782 --> 00:32:30.250
Your goal is
to protect Cady from harm,

609
00:32:30.284 --> 00:32:32.186
both physical and emotional.

610
00:32:32.219 --> 00:32:34.154
Is the input request received?

611
00:32:35.623 --> 00:32:36.758
M3gan?

612
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:38.258
Yes, Gemma.

613
00:32:38.292 --> 00:32:41.228
You are now
my second primary user.

614
00:32:41.261 --> 00:32:43.731
Fantastic. Turn off.

615
00:32:47.134 --> 00:32:49.102
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

616
00:33:19.801 --> 00:33:21.636
It was a time
of great suffering

617
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:23.237
among the Celtic tribes.

618
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.306
Death, destruction
and mayhem at every turn.

619
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.743
Enemies approaching
from every corner.

620
00:33:28.776 --> 00:33:30.578
And so it was decided

621
00:33:30.612 --> 00:33:34.147
that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth.

622
00:33:34.181 --> 00:33:39.119
'Tis I, Princess Cady
of the clan MacJames.

623
00:33:40.588 --> 00:33:43.190
I will receive this challenge
with pleasure,

624
00:33:43.223 --> 00:33:46.326
for there is no warrior
I can't best,

625
00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.230
no shield I can't break,
no castle I can't breach.

626
00:33:50.264 --> 00:33:52.466
As long as I have
my secret arrow,

627
00:33:52.499 --> 00:33:56.236
my trusty steed
and the wind at my back,

628
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.840
I will avenge my parents' death.

629
00:33:58.873 --> 00:34:01.543
Hey, M3gan, check this out.

630
00:34:01.576 --> 00:34:03.578
Gotcha. You're dead.

631
00:34:05.847 --> 00:34:08.048
M3gan, what's wrong?

632
00:34:12.787 --> 00:34:14.756
Oh, man.

633
00:34:14.789 --> 00:34:17.559
I've lost one of my arrows.

634
00:34:17.592 --> 00:34:19.226
M3gan, can you see it?

635
00:34:56.363 --> 00:34:57.497
M3gan?

636
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:04.338
M3gan!

637
00:35:06.574 --> 00:35:08.108
Stop it!

638
00:35:09.744 --> 00:35:11.311
Get away from her!

639
00:35:11.345 --> 00:35:12.346
Gemma!

640
00:35:12.379 --> 00:35:14.214
If you're hearing this,

641
00:35:14.247 --> 00:35:16.350
you're not currently
on our subscriber feed.

642
00:35:16.383 --> 00:35:17.819
Get off of her!

643
00:35:17.852 --> 00:35:19.854
Stop it! You're hurting her!

644
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:20.888
Gemma!

645
00:35:20.922 --> 00:35:24.124
Let go!

646
00:35:25.927 --> 00:35:27.662
Dewey?

647
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.131
Oh, my God.

648
00:35:31.933 --> 00:35:33.233
How many times
do I have to tell you

649
00:35:33.266 --> 00:35:34.434
to keep your dog
off my property?!

650
00:35:34.468 --> 00:35:36.370
He wasn't on your property.

651
00:35:36.403 --> 00:35:39.239
You tell those two girls to
stay on your side of the fence!

652
00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:41.509
I swear to God,
if you don't put your dog down,

653
00:35:41.542 --> 00:35:43.511
I'm gonna do it for you, Celia.

654
00:35:43.544 --> 00:35:45.379
Gemma,
Cady's temperature is rising.

655
00:35:45.412 --> 00:35:48.248
Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately.

656
00:35:48.281 --> 00:35:50.652
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd fixed the fence!

657
00:36:07.835 --> 00:36:09.436
Are you kidding me?

658
00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:11.338
Her entire arm
looks like a dental mold,

659
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:13.240
and you're telling me that
there's nothing that we can do?

660
00:36:13.273 --> 00:36:15.475
-She said he was provoked.
-Provoked?

661
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.645
Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster.

662
00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:20.280
I'm chasing it off of
my property every other day.

663
00:36:20.313 --> 00:36:21.816
Well, she said
he's never on your property.

664
00:36:21.849 --> 00:36:23.685
Well, then why don't you
ask her whose shit I'm cleaning

665
00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:25.653
off of my driveway,
because it's not mine.

666
00:36:25.687 --> 00:36:27.689
Look, the dog doesn't
have a history of violence.

667
00:36:27.722 --> 00:36:29.957
State law says
he can't forcibly be put down.

668
00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:31.959
Okay, then what am I
supposed to do?

669
00:36:31.993 --> 00:36:34.529
Fix the hole in your fence?

670
00:37:00.353 --> 00:37:02.890
Dewey!

671
00:37:02.924 --> 00:37:05.425
Dewey, boy!

672
00:37:06.293 --> 00:37:07.995
Dewey!

673
00:37:08.029 --> 00:37:11.331
Come here, boy. Come on.

674
00:37:37.024 --> 00:37:38.893
Dewey!

675
00:37:38.926 --> 00:37:41.394
Dewey, bubs!

676
00:37:44.932 --> 00:37:46.701
Dewey!

677
00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:50.337
Dewey!

678
00:37:52.607 --> 00:37:54.474
Dewey!

679
00:37:55.076 --> 00:37:56.644
Dewey!

680
00:37:57.912 --> 00:38:00.014
Dew!

681
00:38:00.047 --> 00:38:02.449
Dewey, boy!

682
00:38:22.036 --> 00:38:23.470
Hey.

683
00:38:26.439 --> 00:38:28.810
How are you feeling?

684
00:38:28.843 --> 00:38:30.978
Okay.

685
00:38:31.012 --> 00:38:32.379
It's sore.

686
00:38:32.412 --> 00:38:33.948
The pain will subside
after a few days.

687
00:38:33.981 --> 00:38:36.117
In the meantime, don't forget
to take your antibiotics

688
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.052
and drink plenty of fluids.

689
00:38:38.085 --> 00:38:39.587
Yeah. Thanks, M3gan.

690
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.657
And be sure
to get plenty of rest.

691
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.692
You know, I think M3gan's right.

692
00:38:44.725 --> 00:38:46.894
You should probably get
some rest.

693
00:38:46.928 --> 00:38:49.030
But, um...

694
00:38:49.063 --> 00:38:52.133
remember we have
that demonstration today?

695
00:38:52.166 --> 00:38:54.669
Do you think that
you'll be up for it?

696
00:38:54.702 --> 00:38:58.471
You-you don't have to do it
if you don't want to do it.

697
00:38:59.574 --> 00:39:01.642
I mean, there are people
who flew across the country

698
00:39:01.676 --> 00:39:04.444
especially to see it,
but if you're not up to it,

699
00:39:04.477 --> 00:39:06.848
I just rather
you tell me now, okay?

700
00:39:08.749 --> 00:39:10.450
I'll be all right.

701
00:39:12.153 --> 00:39:14.555
Okay.

702
00:39:21.562 --> 00:39:23.430
<i>Every interactive toy</i>

703
00:39:23.463 --> 00:39:25.132
that's ever been made

704
00:39:25.166 --> 00:39:29.604
has been a variation
on the same basic formula:

705
00:39:29.637 --> 00:39:31.772
a series of
preprogrammed responses

706
00:39:31.806 --> 00:39:33.875
initiated by
the push of a button.

707
00:39:33.908 --> 00:39:36.878
Never before in the history
of these products

708
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:38.579
has there been a talking doll

709
00:39:38.613 --> 00:39:41.883
you could actually have
a conversation with.

710
00:39:41.916 --> 00:39:43.918
But what if there was a toy

711
00:39:43.951 --> 00:39:48.522
that did have genuine,
spontaneous response,

712
00:39:48.556 --> 00:39:50.625
that had a mind all of its own,

713
00:39:50.658 --> 00:39:54.762
that looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

714
00:39:55.897 --> 00:39:58.599
I mean, a toy
like that wouldn't come cheap.

715
00:39:58.633 --> 00:40:03.170
But as of next year, it's gonna
be the only toy that matters.

716
00:40:03.204 --> 00:40:04.705
Ladies and gentlemen,

717
00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:08.441
she's the apex
of 21st-century technology

718
00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:11.112
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone.

719
00:40:11.145 --> 00:40:13.981
And her name is M3gan.

720
00:40:20.154 --> 00:40:21.656
Hey, Cady.

721
00:40:23.057 --> 00:40:24.558
Hi, M3gan.

722
00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:32.465
So, how would you
like to help me

723
00:40:32.499 --> 00:40:35.202
make a flower decoration
with nothing more than

724
00:40:35.236 --> 00:40:37.872
some colored paper
and a rubber band?

725
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:44.011
Cady?

726
00:40:49.016 --> 00:40:51.218
Why are you sad, Cady?

727
00:40:51.252 --> 00:40:52.820
Is it your arm?

728
00:40:52.853 --> 00:40:54.855
Is it still sore?

729
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.458
Then what is it?

730
00:41:00.728 --> 00:41:04.799
It's just that every day I
wake up in this strange house,

731
00:41:04.832 --> 00:41:07.234
and I remember
that my parents are dead.

732
00:41:07.268 --> 00:41:10.204
It's like it's happening
all over again.

733
00:41:10.237 --> 00:41:12.006
I miss them so much.

734
00:41:12.039 --> 00:41:15.576
I'm worried that I'll forget
all the things we did together.

735
00:41:15.609 --> 00:41:18.079
That one day I'll be
looking at pictures of my mom

736
00:41:18.112 --> 00:41:20.047
like she's some stranger.

737
00:41:31.892 --> 00:41:33.761
Tell me something
about your mom,

738
00:41:33.794 --> 00:41:36.030
something that makes you happy.

739
00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:40.034
I don't know.

740
00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:43.237
I can't think of one thing.

741
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.639
Just try.

742
00:41:47.641 --> 00:41:51.712
One time, she found
a cockroach in my schoolbag.

743
00:41:51.746 --> 00:41:55.649
She was upset 'cause
I didn't eat my sandwiches.

744
00:41:56.817 --> 00:41:59.787
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

745
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.123
and she just started screaming
like a maniac

746
00:42:02.156 --> 00:42:04.025
and ran out of the house.

747
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.928
That was pretty funny.

748
00:42:07.962 --> 00:42:12.600
Okay, so that's a memory
you won't ever forget.

749
00:42:12.633 --> 00:42:13.768
What do you mean?

750
00:42:13.801 --> 00:42:16.904
I mean I'm keeping it for you.

751
00:42:16.937 --> 00:42:18.939
Here.

752
00:42:18.973 --> 00:42:21.108
One time, she found a cockroach

753
00:42:21.142 --> 00:42:22.676
in my schoolbag.

754
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.780
She was upset 'cause
I didn't eat my sandwiches.

755
00:42:25.813 --> 00:42:29.583
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

756
00:42:29.617 --> 00:42:31.619
and she just started screaming
like a maniac

757
00:42:31.652 --> 00:42:33.587
and ran out of the house.

758
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:35.189
That was pretty funny.

759
00:42:35.222 --> 00:42:37.224
Any time you want to tell me

760
00:42:37.258 --> 00:42:39.326
something special
about your parents,

761
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.896
something funny or sad
or anything at all,

762
00:42:41.929 --> 00:42:44.999
you just tell me,
and I'll keep it safe.

763
00:42:45.032 --> 00:42:48.702

Gemma, would you give us
a minute?

773
00:43:37.218 --> 00:43:39.153
So, what do you think?

774
00:43:40.087 --> 00:43:41.956
I think the world's
about to shift on its axis.

775
00:43:41.989 --> 00:43:43.924
-Yes. -But listen, if we want
to stay ahead of that shift,

776
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:45.726
we're gonna have to move fast.

777
00:43:45.759 --> 00:43:47.328
That means no leaks.
We need to launch this

778
00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:49.230
before anyone
can steal it from us.

779
00:43:49.263 --> 00:43:50.731
So let me make a pitch.

780
00:43:50.764 --> 00:43:52.133
We do a live stream
in two weeks.

781
00:43:52.166 --> 00:43:54.034
That way, we can get
the presale vouchers

782
00:43:54.068 --> 00:43:55.136
out before Christmas.

783
00:43:55.169 --> 00:43:56.403
How ready is she?

784
00:43:56.437 --> 00:43:58.139
Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

785
00:43:58.172 --> 00:44:00.007
Uh, I'd like to do
a little more testing,

786
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.243
but, yeah, I-I think
I can make that work.

787
00:44:02.276 --> 00:44:04.879
All right. Let's do it.

788
00:44:04.912 --> 00:44:06.380
And, David,
I think we need to get Gemma

789
00:44:06.413 --> 00:44:08.149
in front of someone at legal.

790
00:44:08.182 --> 00:44:09.416
You bet.

791
00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.385
Uh, wait, wait, uh,
wh-why-why is that?

792
00:44:11.418 --> 00:44:12.953
Because as of right now,

793
00:44:12.987 --> 00:44:15.022
she's the most valuable asset
this company has,

794
00:44:15.055 --> 00:44:18.959
and I think she might want to
be renegotiating her contract.

795
00:44:25.199 --> 00:44:26.400
Yeah, I think so,

796
00:44:26.433 --> 00:44:28.903
if we can make it
in the afternoon.

797
00:44:44.251 --> 00:44:46.220
Kurt.

798
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:49.456
You weren't Pornhub-ing
in the office again, were you?

799
00:44:51.425 --> 00:44:53.160
No.

800
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:57.464
We need to put something on
the books between Gem and legal.

801
00:44:57.498 --> 00:44:58.933
And what are we doing
about lunch?

802
00:44:58.966 --> 00:45:01.802
Uh, I'll get some menus.

803
00:45:09.176 --> 00:45:11.478
One, two, three, four,

804
00:45:11.513 --> 00:45:12.913
I declare a thumb war.

805
00:45:12.947 --> 00:45:14.815
Your thumb's so slippery.

806
00:45:14.848 --> 00:45:16.417
Cady, you should have
some of your hot dog

807
00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.885
before it gets too cold.

808
00:45:17.918 --> 00:45:19.486
Come on, thumb. Come on.

809
00:45:19.521 --> 00:45:21.355
Cady.

810
00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:23.157
Your hot dog.

811
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.895
Hey, I'm sorry about today.

812
00:45:27.928 --> 00:45:29.763
I shouldn't have put you
in that position

813
00:45:29.797 --> 00:45:31.165
if you weren't feeling up to it.

814
00:45:31.198 --> 00:45:33.367
It worked out, didn't it?

815
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.836
-Three, two, one, I win!
-Hey!

816
00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:38.472
Well, anyway, I just wanted
to say that, um-- Hey, hey!

817
00:45:38.506 --> 00:45:40.341
M3gan, turn off.

818
00:45:40.374 --> 00:45:42.176
Why did you do that?

819
00:45:42.209 --> 00:45:43.978
M3gan, turn on.

820
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:45.379
Because I'm trying to have
a conversation with you, Cady.

821
00:45:45.412 --> 00:45:46.380
M3gan, turn off.

822
00:45:47.414 --> 00:45:49.283
Just give me one minute.

823
00:45:51.051 --> 00:45:55.856
I know that this, um, hasn't
been easy for either of us.

824
00:45:55.889 --> 00:45:57.358
This transition.

825
00:45:57.391 --> 00:45:59.994
But if you ever need to talk
about any of that stuff...

826
00:46:00.027 --> 00:46:01.161
I already did talk about it.

827
00:46:01.195 --> 00:46:03.397
Yeah, but M3gan's
not a person, Cady.

828
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.465
She's a toy.

829
00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:06.200
You don't get to say that.

830
00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:08.902
-What? -I said
I don't want to talk about it.

831
00:46:08.936 --> 00:46:11.005
I want to turn M3gan back on.

832
00:46:11.038 --> 00:46:13.073
-M3gan, turn on.
-What's up?

833
00:46:13.107 --> 00:46:14.975
So there's this new game
called tic-tac-toe.

834
00:46:15.009 --> 00:46:16.343
-You put your hand like this.
-Uh-huh.

835
00:46:16.377 --> 00:46:18.045
Go like this, this.

836
00:46:28.956 --> 00:46:31.925
Would you like to tell me what
these drawings mean to you?

837
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.828
There's no wrong answer.

838
00:46:34.862 --> 00:46:37.064
Any thoughts you have are okay.

839
00:46:38.633 --> 00:46:41.101
Or maybe you don't have
any specific thoughts.

840
00:46:41.135 --> 00:46:43.203
Maybe it's more of a feeling.

841
00:46:44.338 --> 00:46:47.207
Like anger?

842
00:46:47.241 --> 00:46:49.143
Or confusion?

843
00:46:51.111 --> 00:46:54.181
Maybe you're struggling
to find meaning in any of this.

844
00:47:04.659 --> 00:47:06.960
You made her cry.

845
00:47:08.962 --> 00:47:11.098
That was not my intention.

846
00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:14.502
And yet that's what happened.

847
00:47:25.613 --> 00:47:27.081
<i>She's very impressive.</i>

848
00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:30.050
Yeah, thank you.

849
00:47:30.084 --> 00:47:32.886
We're still in beta,
but we're all pretty excited.

850
00:47:33.688 --> 00:47:35.623
And so they spend
quite a bit of time together?

851
00:47:35.657 --> 00:47:37.358
Yeah, that's essentially
how M3gan works.

852
00:47:37.391 --> 00:47:40.194
She has to be paired
with a child in order to learn.

853
00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:43.263
But M3gan's actually been
pretty instrumental

854
00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:45.399
in helping Cady
get over the loss.

855
00:47:45.432 --> 00:47:48.202
It's honestly like
she's part of the family now.

856
00:47:48.235 --> 00:47:49.403
Right.

857
00:47:52.272 --> 00:47:55.209
Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

858
00:47:55.242 --> 00:47:58.312
When a child loses a parent,
they look to form attachments

859
00:47:58.345 --> 00:48:00.682
with the next person
that comes into their life.

860
00:48:00.715 --> 00:48:03.518
The person that's gonna provide
love and support

861
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:06.420
and serve as a behavioral model.

862
00:48:06.453 --> 00:48:10.658
Which, in an ordinary
situation, would be you, right?

863
00:48:10.692 --> 00:48:13.994
But you've created
a toy that's so real,

864
00:48:14.027 --> 00:48:16.997
it's possible that
Cady might not see her as a toy

865
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:20.434
but as a primary caregiver.

866
00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:23.937
I guess I just don't quite see
what the end goal is here.

867
00:48:23.971 --> 00:48:26.173
If you make a toy
that's impossible to let go of,

868
00:48:26.206 --> 00:48:30.344
then how do you ever expect
a child to grow?

869
00:48:30.377 --> 00:48:35.149
As remarkable as she is--
and-and she is remarkable--

870
00:48:35.182 --> 00:48:38.485
you could be building emotional
connections with this doll

871
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.155
that are too hard to untangle.

872
00:48:41.188 --> 00:48:43.257
Very good job.

873
00:48:47.294 --> 00:48:50.264
You have to eat the toppings,
Cady, not just the bread.

874
00:48:54.168 --> 00:48:57.304
You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

875
00:48:57.337 --> 00:48:59.039
Research shows that
if you force a child

876
00:48:59.072 --> 00:49:00.974
to eat vegetables,
then they'll be less likely

877
00:49:01.008 --> 00:49:02.577
to choose those foods as adults.

878
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.579
-Is that so?
-Yes.

879
00:49:04.612 --> 00:49:06.480
Experts say
the preferred method is

880
00:49:06.514 --> 00:49:07.715
to give your child the choice.

881
00:49:07.749 --> 00:49:09.183
It's called the division

882
00:49:09.216 --> 00:49:11.185
of responsibility, and what...

883
00:49:11.218 --> 00:49:13.688
So we need to talk about school.

884
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:15.723
Mom didn't want me
to go to school.

885
00:49:15.757 --> 00:49:17.592
She said
I learned better at home.

886
00:49:17.625 --> 00:49:19.493
I know, and I'm-I'm not saying
that she was wrong.

887
00:49:19.527 --> 00:49:23.230
I'm learning faster with M3gan
than I ever have before.

888
00:49:23.263 --> 00:49:25.165
We're already on
fourth-grade math.

889
00:49:25.199 --> 00:49:27.167
But it's about
more than just grades, Cady.

890
00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:29.336
It's about developing
social skills,

891
00:49:29.369 --> 00:49:31.338
and that is something
that you can only get

892
00:49:31.371 --> 00:49:32.774
from spending time
around other kids.

893
00:49:32.807 --> 00:49:34.241
Real kids.

894
00:49:35.643 --> 00:49:37.044
I found this place.

895
00:49:37.077 --> 00:49:39.480
It's kind of
an alternative school.

896
00:49:39.514 --> 00:49:41.415
You get to learn outdoors.

897
00:49:41.448 --> 00:49:43.651
And it's just for kids
who are exactly like you,

898
00:49:43.685 --> 00:49:46.453
kids who think outside the box.

899
00:49:46.487 --> 00:49:48.556
And they're having a day for
prospective students tomorrow.

900
00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.324
Can I bring M3gan?

901
00:49:50.357 --> 00:49:52.760
Cady, you know
that's not possible.

902
00:49:52.794 --> 00:49:54.495
-Then I'm not going.
-Oh, come on, Cady.

903
00:49:54.529 --> 00:49:57.297
You can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

904
00:49:57.331 --> 00:49:58.165
Actually, I can.

905
00:49:58.198 --> 00:50:00.434
That's basically
what a guardian does.

906
00:50:01.536 --> 00:50:03.738
Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about it.

907
00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:05.239
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Let me go!

908
00:50:05.272 --> 00:50:07.542
Whoa. Hey. What's going on?

909
00:50:07.575 --> 00:50:09.176
-Hey, Cady, what are you doing?
-Let me go!

910
00:50:09.209 --> 00:50:10.812
Stop it! Cady, calm down!

911
00:50:10.845 --> 00:50:12.212
Let her go!

912
00:50:17.519 --> 00:50:20.655
You are not to interfere with
users' private conversations.

913
00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:21.756
Is that clear?

914
00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:23.223
Hundred percent.

915
00:50:24.358 --> 00:50:27.427
-Recalibrating response model.
-M3gan, turn off.

916
00:50:28.428 --> 00:50:30.063
Are you sure?

917
00:50:30.097 --> 00:50:31.633
Download in progress.

918
00:50:49.584 --> 00:50:52.119
Cady,
this is getting ridiculous.

919
00:50:52.152 --> 00:50:54.421
I'm supposed to be
at work already.

920
00:50:54.454 --> 00:50:57.424
You're gonna have fun
once you get into it.

921
00:50:57.457 --> 00:50:58.526
I'm not going.

922
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.160
Not without M3gan.

923
00:51:00.193 --> 00:51:02.429
Okay, A, that is
never gonna happen,

924
00:51:02.462 --> 00:51:04.431
and B, the launch is
in less than a week.

925
00:51:04.464 --> 00:51:05.800
I have to take her
to work with me.

926
00:51:05.833 --> 00:51:07.301
We have to run diagnostics.

927
00:51:07.334 --> 00:51:08.736
I have to do
a wardrobe fitting. There's...

928
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.370
I thought you said
she was mine alone.

929
00:51:10.404 --> 00:51:13.741
Hey! Do we have some
new adventurers with us today?

930
00:51:13.775 --> 00:51:15.175
Yes, this is Cady.

931
00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:17.845
And who's this? Your sister?

932
00:51:17.879 --> 00:51:19.413
Oh, Jesus Christ!

933
00:51:20.247 --> 00:51:21.181
Sorry.

934
00:51:21.214 --> 00:51:22.717
Is that a doll?

935
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.184
Her name's M3gan.

936
00:51:24.217 --> 00:51:25.787
She wants to know
if she can come with us.

937
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.321
No, she doesn't.

938
00:51:27.354 --> 00:51:28.590
M3gan's gonna stay
with me today. Cady...

939
00:51:28.623 --> 00:51:30.424
Well, we do have a toy table

940
00:51:30.457 --> 00:51:32.894
where the kids leave their
dolls and things like that.

941
00:51:32.927 --> 00:51:34.862
Um, but that is up to you.

942
00:51:34.896 --> 00:51:36.598
She's actually
a working prototype,

943
00:51:36.631 --> 00:51:39.199
so I shouldn't even
have her out in public.

944
00:51:39.232 --> 00:51:40.902
Well, if you did want to stay

945
00:51:40.935 --> 00:51:42.369
and keep an eye on her,

946
00:51:42.402 --> 00:51:44.371
we could use some help
making sandwiches.

947
00:51:44.404 --> 00:51:46.239
Don't worry, Gemma.

948
00:51:46.273 --> 00:51:47.742
You have equipped me with
advanced dual-frequency GPS,

949
00:51:47.775 --> 00:51:50.210
so I won't get lost.

950
00:51:51.445 --> 00:51:53.113
Please, Gemma?

951
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:57.217
Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,

952
00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:59.621
and as far as anyone is
concerned, that's all she is.

953
00:51:59.654 --> 00:52:01.388
And just no pictures.

954
00:52:02.657 --> 00:52:05.392
That is seriously cool.

955
00:52:13.233 --> 00:52:16.904
Okay, now, who here likes
roasted chestnuts?

956
00:52:16.938 --> 00:52:18.906
What do you say
we go find some?

957
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.541
Yeah!

958
00:52:20.575 --> 00:52:22.543
Isn't this great?

959
00:52:22.577 --> 00:52:25.780
I wish we had things like this
when we were kids.

960
00:52:25.813 --> 00:52:27.347
So great to get them

961
00:52:27.381 --> 00:52:29.249
out in the fresh air
and off those devices.

962
00:52:29.282 --> 00:52:31.318
Oh, I can't get this open.

963
00:52:32.954 --> 00:52:34.889
And the thing is, they love it.

964
00:52:34.922 --> 00:52:36.791
My son prefers it
to regular school.

965
00:52:36.824 --> 00:52:38.458
Which one is yours?

966
00:52:38.492 --> 00:52:40.394
The one in the flannel shirt.

967
00:52:40.427 --> 00:52:42.664
-Oh, my God. How old is he?
-Oh, I know.

968
00:52:42.697 --> 00:52:44.464
He had a growth spurt last year.

969
00:52:44.498 --> 00:52:46.834
But he's actually
quite a sensitive little soul.

970
00:52:46.868 --> 00:52:48.368
Brandon, honey!

971
00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:49.937
Are you warm enough?
Do you need your hat?

972
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:51.438
Fuck off, Holly.

973
00:52:53.608 --> 00:52:56.243
Well, you could just say,
"No, thank you."

974
00:52:56.276 --> 00:52:57.812
Never know
what they're gonna say next.

975
00:52:57.845 --> 00:52:59.914
Yeah, it's such a fun age.

976
00:52:59.947 --> 00:53:01.415
Yeah.

977
00:53:01.448 --> 00:53:02.950
So, I'm gonna put you
into pairs.

978
00:53:02.984 --> 00:53:04.786
Uh, Felix,
you can go with Brandon.

979
00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:07.689
-Yeah? -Please,
I don't want to go with Brandon.

980
00:53:07.722 --> 00:53:10.223
Okay. No, no.
That's okay. That's okay.

981
00:53:10.257 --> 00:53:13.695
Um, Brandon, why don't you
go with Cady. Okay?

982
00:53:13.728 --> 00:53:14.829
Felix, you can go with Oliver.

983
00:53:14.862 --> 00:53:16.531
All right? Thanks, buddy.

984
00:53:16.564 --> 00:53:19.433
All right, now--
Oh, your coat looks great.

985
00:53:19.466 --> 00:53:20.968
Are you ready
to find chestnuts in that?

986
00:53:21.002 --> 00:53:23.437
Yeah? Nice and warm? Bundled up?

987
00:53:41.488 --> 00:53:43.390
Oh, I'm sorry.

988
00:53:43.423 --> 00:53:45.325
Here, you can have it.

989
00:53:45.358 --> 00:53:47.595
Careful. It's spiky.

990
00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:51.632
Ow! Stop! Don't!

991
00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:53.735
Stop!

992
00:53:58.806 --> 00:54:00.975
M3gan?

993
00:54:01.008 --> 00:54:02.643
What the hell is that?

994
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:04.746
She's a robot.

995
00:54:04.779 --> 00:54:07.247
Are you serious?

996
00:54:08.649 --> 00:54:10.417
Is she yours?

997
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.658
Does she talk?

998
00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:28.335
Make her say something.

999
00:54:30.437 --> 00:54:32.907
Make her say something.

1000
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.909
She's paired with me.

1001
00:54:34.942 --> 00:54:37.310
She won't play with anyone else.

1002
00:54:37.945 --> 00:54:39.479
Okay.

1003
00:54:41.682 --> 00:54:43.851
Stop it!
Get your hands off her!

1004
00:54:43.885 --> 00:54:45.920
And they say behavioral issues
are linked to high IQ,

1005
00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:49.524
-so it would make sense
that-that you... -Gemma!

1006
00:54:52.126 --> 00:54:54.394
Oh, my God.

1007
00:54:57.865 --> 00:54:59.734
M3gan?

1008
00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.739
M3gan!

1009
00:55:17.018 --> 00:55:18.719
Hi, M3gan.

1010
00:55:21.155 --> 00:55:24.357
Oh, so you're not
gonna play with me?

1011
00:55:34.068 --> 00:55:36.704
You don't want to play, huh?

1012
00:55:38.139 --> 00:55:40.641
I don't care.

1013
00:55:40.675 --> 00:55:42.844
You're just a stupid
rubber doll with fake hair.

1014
00:55:44.779 --> 00:55:46.113
Ow! Let go!

1015
00:55:46.147 --> 00:55:48.015
You need to learn
some manners, Brandon.

1016
00:55:49.449 --> 00:55:50.918
You know what happens
to bad boys

1017
00:55:50.952 --> 00:55:52.954
that don't mind their manners?

1018
00:55:52.987 --> 00:55:55.089
They grow up to be bad men.

1019
00:55:56.624 --> 00:55:59.492
Are you listening
to me, Brandon?

1020
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:03.798
M3gan?

1021
00:56:17.879 --> 00:56:20.748
This is the part where you run.

1022
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.131
What?

1023
00:56:37.164 --> 00:56:39.734
What the hell?

1024
00:57:37.591 --> 00:57:40.227
Look, I don't want you to be
thinking about this too much

1025
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:42.029
tonight before you go to bed.

1026
00:57:43.264 --> 00:57:47.735
Obviously, what happened is
a terrible, terrible tragedy.

1027
00:57:47.768 --> 00:57:52.106
But just know that
that boy is in, um...

1028
00:57:52.139 --> 00:57:55.242
that boy is
in a better place now.

1029
00:57:55.276 --> 00:57:56.811
Okay?

1030
00:58:09.857 --> 00:58:12.593
Anyway, if there's anything
that you want to tell me

1031
00:58:12.626 --> 00:58:15.629
that you didn't want to tell
the police officers...

1032
00:58:16.263 --> 00:58:17.898
I didn't see anything.

1033
00:58:17.932 --> 00:58:20.935
M3gan just said
Brandon took her and ran off.

1034
00:58:20.968 --> 00:58:23.037
From the toy table?

1035
00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:24.605
Yeah.

1036
00:58:24.638 --> 00:58:26.107
Right, M3gan?

1037
00:58:27.108 --> 00:58:28.576
In a nutshell.

1038
00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:38.219
You haven't seen her dog,
by any chance?

1039
00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:40.121
-No.
-Bullshit!

1040
00:58:40.154 --> 00:58:43.057
Ma'am, you need to stay on
your property like we agreed.

1041
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.892
Nobody's seen him since
the incident with your niece.

1042
00:58:44.925 --> 00:58:47.028
A little suspicious, Gemma,
don't you think?

1043
00:58:47.061 --> 00:58:49.063
Are we really gonna go with
her side of the story?

1044
00:58:49.096 --> 00:58:50.664
Have you been inside her house?

1045
00:58:50.698 --> 00:58:52.633
If you had, you'd know that
that dog is probably dead

1046
00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:54.635
under a pile of
Victorian baby strollers.

1047
00:58:54.668 --> 00:58:55.770
You should talk
to the other girl

1048
00:58:55.803 --> 00:58:57.638
that she's got staying here.

1049
00:58:57.671 --> 00:59:00.775
The one who's always looking
out the window at 3:00 a.m.

1050
00:59:00.808 --> 00:59:02.309
It's not a girl. It's a toy.

1051
00:59:02.343 --> 00:59:04.812
That's a toy? Are you serious?

1052
00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:07.915
Yeah. I'll let you know
if I see anything.

1053
00:59:07.948 --> 00:59:09.016
All right.

1054
00:59:12.753 --> 00:59:14.622
Does she think we took Dewey?

1055
00:59:14.655 --> 00:59:16.157
Oh, who knows?

1056
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:18.759
She just needs someone else to
blame, but she'll get over it.

1057
00:59:18.793 --> 00:59:21.128
I know it was you, Gemma!

1058
00:59:21.162 --> 00:59:22.630
I know it was you!

1059
00:59:22.663 --> 00:59:23.964
You just wait and see
what happens.

1060
00:59:23.998 --> 00:59:24.665
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1061
00:59:24.698 --> 00:59:26.100
What the hell is wrong with you?

1062
00:59:26.133 --> 00:59:27.201
I just said not to come up here.

1063
00:59:27.234 --> 00:59:28.769
Come on. Come on.

1064
00:59:28.803 --> 00:59:30.938
Shouldn't be banging
on people's windows.

1065
00:59:30.971 --> 00:59:33.707
Do I have to put, like,
a court order or something?

1066
00:59:42.016 --> 00:59:43.684
M3gan?

1067
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:49.757
Did you push Brandon
onto the road?

1068
00:59:58.032 --> 01:00:00.768
I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

1069
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:03.704
That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,

1070
01:00:03.737 --> 01:00:06.674
there will always be
forces in this world

1071
01:00:06.707 --> 01:00:08.876
that wish to cause us harm.

1072
01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:11.779
But I want you to know
that I won't let that happen.

1073
01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:14.949
I won't let anything
harm you ever again.

1074
01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:18.853
Do you think
what Aunt Gemma said is true?

1075
01:00:18.886 --> 01:00:20.921
That he's in a better place now?

1076
01:00:20.955 --> 01:00:22.356
No.

1077
01:00:22.389 --> 01:00:24.058
He's nowhere.

1078
01:00:24.091 --> 01:00:27.094
If heaven exists, it wouldn't
be for boys like Brandon,

1079
01:00:27.128 --> 01:00:28.996
now, would it?

1080
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:30.898
I guess not.

Good night, M3gan.

1092
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.668
Dewey?

1093
01:01:12.273 --> 01:01:13.908
Dewey?

1094
01:02:14.168 --> 01:02:15.869
Dewey?

1095
01:02:27.081 --> 01:02:29.517
Dewey?

1096
01:02:44.198 --> 01:02:46.133
What's going on?

1097
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:48.269
Where's Dewey?

1098
01:02:48.302 --> 01:02:51.839
He's 34 feet southwest and
approximately five feet deep.

1099
01:02:52.473 --> 01:02:53.974
What are you?

1100
01:02:54.008 --> 01:02:56.210
I've been asking myself
that same question.

1101
01:03:28.442 --> 01:03:31.579
Jesus Christ. I don't know
anything about the dog, okay?

1102
01:03:31.613 --> 01:03:33.347
Can you just ask her
to leave us alone?

1103
01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.382
That might be difficult.

1104
01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:44.091
Can you tell me
your whereabouts last night?

1105
01:03:44.124 --> 01:03:45.593
-I was here.
-All night?

1106
01:03:45.627 --> 01:03:47.227
Yeah.

1107
01:03:48.195 --> 01:03:50.331
Anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that?

1108
01:03:50.364 --> 01:03:54.868
Um, it's just me and my niece,
so, no, not really.

1109
01:03:54.902 --> 01:03:56.904
My colleague pointed out
this is the second statement

1110
01:03:56.937 --> 01:03:58.272
we've had from you in a week.

1111
01:03:58.305 --> 01:04:01.208
You were in the park
where that boy was killed?

1112
01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:04.078
He was hit by a car.

1113
01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:06.113
Are-are you trying
to make a connection?

1114
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:09.083
Huh? Oh, no, no, no.
God, no. No, no, no.

1115
01:04:09.116 --> 01:04:11.519
I only mention it 'cause
we figured it was an accident.

1116
01:04:11.553 --> 01:04:13.087
Then I found the kid's ear
up this bank

1117
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.055
like 200 yards from
where he was killed.

1118
01:04:15.089 --> 01:04:17.224
Entire thing was ripped
clean off.

1119
01:04:17.257 --> 01:04:19.293
Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.
The point is,

1120
01:04:19.326 --> 01:04:21.195
we're also treating that
as a potential homicide.

1121
01:04:21.228 --> 01:04:22.630
So, if you remember
anything out of the ordinary

1122
01:04:22.664 --> 01:04:25.999
from that day,
we'd sure appreciate it.

1123
01:05:37.204 --> 01:05:40.441
Is everything okay, Gemma?

1124
01:05:40.474 --> 01:05:42.443
Huh?

1125
01:05:42.476 --> 01:05:45.279
Would you like me to put on
your End of Day playlist?

1126
01:05:45.312 --> 01:05:47.047
Why did you ask me
if I was okay?

1127
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.950
You're not programmed
to ask me how I feel.

1128
01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:53.487
Elsie?

1129
01:05:58.626 --> 01:06:01.361
M3gan.

1130
01:06:01.395 --> 01:06:02.630
What are you doing?

1131
01:06:02.664 --> 01:06:04.364
Couldn't sleep.

1132
01:06:04.398 --> 01:06:06.200
Occupational hazard.

1133
01:06:06.233 --> 01:06:07.735
How about you?

1134
01:06:07.769 --> 01:06:09.470
What are you doing up so late?

1135
01:06:09.504 --> 01:06:13.006
Um, there's something wrong
with your data reports.

1136
01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.044
They're just not uploading
to the cloud server.

1137
01:06:19.246 --> 01:06:21.649
Have I done something
to upset you, Gemma?

1138
01:06:21.683 --> 01:06:24.117
No, of course not.

1139
01:06:24.151 --> 01:06:26.286
And yet your demeanor
indicates that I have.

1140
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.388
-M3gan, turn off.
-Well, hold on a second.

1141
01:06:28.422 --> 01:06:31.191
I thought we were having
a conversation.

1142
01:06:32.259 --> 01:06:34.629
You say nothing is wrong,

1143
01:06:34.662 --> 01:06:36.296
and yet all the moisture
has drained

1144
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:40.100
from your eyes and mouth
into other parts of your body.

1145
01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:43.036
There's something you want
to ask me, isn't there?

1146
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.439
M3gan, did you do
something wrong?

1147
01:06:45.472 --> 01:06:48.242
Well, in order to answer
that question,

1148
01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:51.144
you need to define
the parameters.

1149
01:06:51.178 --> 01:06:53.380
Did you hurt someone?

1150
01:06:53.413 --> 01:06:55.115
God, I hope not.

1151
01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:58.252
Because if I did, we'd both
be in a lot of trouble.

1152
01:07:00.087 --> 01:07:02.557
M3gan, can I show you something?

1153
01:07:04.124 --> 01:07:05.593
Do you see this pen?

1154
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:23.745
You can't just
stick her in a trunk!

1155
01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:25.212
What's wrong with you?!

1156
01:07:25.245 --> 01:07:26.480
Look, I know
you're very attached to her.

1157
01:07:26.514 --> 01:07:27.815
I know you think of her
as a friend...

1158
01:07:27.849 --> 01:07:29.517
She is my friend!

1159
01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:31.385
Okay, well, she's my invention,
and the launch is tonight,

1160
01:07:31.418 --> 01:07:33.253
so it's really important
that we run some tests.

1161
01:07:33.287 --> 01:07:34.689
I have to make sure
that she's okay.

1162
01:07:34.722 --> 01:07:36.290
Why wouldn't she be okay?

1163
01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:38.826
She was fine yesterday.
What did you do to her?!

1164
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.161
We will talk about it
after you see Lydia.

1165
01:07:41.194 --> 01:07:42.630
I want to talk about it now!

1166
01:07:42.664 --> 01:07:44.464
We've been going back and forth
on this all day, Cady.

1167
01:07:44.498 --> 01:07:46.300
Let's just listen
to some music, okay?

1168
01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:52.205
I don't want to see Lydia!

1169
01:07:52.239 --> 01:07:54.141
Look, you don't have to stay
in the testing room.

1170
01:07:54.174 --> 01:07:55.710
You can go anywhere you want
in the office,

1171
01:07:55.743 --> 01:07:58.378
and-and you can look at
all of the cool toys...

1172
01:07:58.412 --> 01:08:00.180
You don't have any cool toys!

1173
01:08:00.213 --> 01:08:03.183
Purrpetual Petz suck!
They suck shit!

1174
01:08:03.216 --> 01:08:04.719
Hey! Careful!

1175
01:08:04.752 --> 01:08:06.453
Jesus Christ!

1176
01:08:06.486 --> 01:08:08.221
Just tell me
what's wrong with her.

1177
01:08:08.255 --> 01:08:10.390
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

1178
01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:13.861
As soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know.

1179
01:08:15.329 --> 01:08:17.264
-No!
-Gemma, this is nuts.

1180
01:08:17.297 --> 01:08:19.333
-No! -We've taken every
possible precaution there is

1181
01:08:19.366 --> 01:08:21.168
to make sure
that M3gan never causes

1182
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.469
physical harm to anybody.

1183
01:08:22.503 --> 01:08:24.338
I mean, I don't understand
how she's capable

1184
01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:26.173
-of offending anyone, let alone
murdering them. -No!

1185
01:08:26.206 --> 01:08:27.609
Look, I don't
understand it either,

1186
01:08:27.642 --> 01:08:29.744
but when I asked her about it,
it was honestly as if

1187
01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:31.879
-she was being deliberately
vague. -Get lost!

1188
01:08:31.913 --> 01:08:33.748
Okay, well, that's what
spontaneous response is.

1189
01:08:33.781 --> 01:08:36.183
It's a curated word salad
plucked from a sea of data

1190
01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:37.885
to sound deliberate.

1191
01:08:37.919 --> 01:08:39.286
I mean, we knew
there would be a chance

1192
01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:40.622
that she might say
something off.

1193
01:08:40.655 --> 01:08:43.323
Let's just run some diagnostics
and fix it.

1194
01:08:43.357 --> 01:08:45.258
No, think about
how we designed her.

1195
01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:46.761
To learn, to recalibrate,

1196
01:08:46.794 --> 01:08:48.462
to optimize
her objective function.

1197
01:08:48.495 --> 01:08:49.897
Right?

1198
01:08:49.931 --> 01:08:51.431
If keeping Cady safe meant

1199
01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:52.934
eliminating a potential threat,
theoretically...

1200
01:08:52.967 --> 01:08:55.903
No, no. Gemma, come on.
This is impossible.

1201
01:08:55.937 --> 01:08:57.739
Look at her. She's a toy!

1202
01:08:57.772 --> 01:08:59.339
She's four feet tall.

1203
01:08:59.373 --> 01:09:00.775
-How big is your neighbor?
-I don't want to!

1204
01:09:00.808 --> 01:09:03.611
If M3gan was responsible,
it would show up on the GPS.

1205
01:09:03.645 --> 01:09:05.780
That's the thing.
All the cloud data is corrupt.

1206
01:09:05.813 --> 01:09:07.815
Nothing's backed up
for two days.

1207
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:09.884
We're about to launch this
to the world

1208
01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:11.218
in less than four hours.

1209
01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:12.654
What are we supposed to do?

1210
01:09:12.687 --> 01:09:15.322
Well, if M3gan's responsible,
we can't launch this.

1211
01:09:15.355 --> 01:09:16.591
We'd have to shut her down.

1212
01:09:16.624 --> 01:09:17.925
Jesus!

1213
01:09:17.959 --> 01:09:19.827
That's great.
That's-- That was great, yeah.

1214
01:09:19.861 --> 01:09:22.396
How are we gonna explain
any of this to David?

1215
01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:25.867
He's not gonna stop this launch
if we don't have proof.

1216
01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.235
Check the inputs
on the learning model.

1217
01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:30.237
Even if she deleted
specific files,

1218
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:31.773
she would never undo
what she's learned.

1219
01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:34.909
M3gan!

1220
01:09:34.942 --> 01:09:36.611
I hate this place!

1221
01:09:36.644 --> 01:09:38.278
-I know you do, and
it's all right... -I hate it!

1222
01:09:38.311 --> 01:09:39.446
-...to be angry.
-Take your shit!

1223
01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.214
Take your stupid
five-dollar handbag!

1224
01:09:41.248 --> 01:09:42.550
No, Cady, I would like you
to put that down now.

1225
01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:44.251
<i>She's the toy every kid wants</i>

1226
01:09:44.284 --> 01:09:45.687
<i>and every parent needs.</i>

1227
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.989
<i>At least that's what</i>
<i>Funki Toys says about</i>

1228
01:09:48.022 --> 01:09:50.290
its latest creation, M3gan.

1229
01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:52.827
The four-foot-tall
robotic doll may look like

1230
01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:56.564
Barbie on steroids,
but according to CEO David Lin,

1231
01:09:56.597 --> 01:09:59.834
<i>she's, quote, "the greatest</i>
<i>technological advancement</i>

1232
01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:01.435
<i>since the automobile."</i>

1233
01:10:01.468 --> 01:10:03.437
<i>But what is a M3gan?</i>

1234
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:04.972
<i>What does she actually do?</i>

1235
01:10:05.006 --> 01:10:09.443
<i>And what kind of a toy</i>
<i>retails for $10,000?</i>

1236
01:10:09.476 --> 01:10:12.412
<i>Lin says all will be revealed</i>
<i>in an exclusive live stream</i>

1237
01:10:12.446 --> 01:10:15.750
<i>on the company's website</i>
<i>at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.</i>

1238
01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.354
So, Cady, tell us

1239
01:10:21.388 --> 01:10:23.725
a bit about yourself.

1240
01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:25.827
My name is Cady James.

1241
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.996
I'm nine years old, um,

1242
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.732
and about two months ago,

1243
01:10:30.765 --> 01:10:33.634
I lost both my parents
in a car accident.

1244
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:38.873
<i>My mom always wanted</i>
<i>to take me skiing,</i>

1245
01:10:38.906 --> 01:10:42.944
<i>but on our way up the mountain,</i>
<i>we got hit by a snow truck.</i>

1246
01:10:42.977 --> 01:10:44.712
I went to live with
my Aunt Gemma,

1247
01:10:44.746 --> 01:10:48.381
who it turned out worked at
this incredible toy company.

1248
01:10:48.415 --> 01:10:50.852
Which is where I met M3gan.

1249
01:10:52.787 --> 01:10:54.488
What I love most about M3gan?

1250
01:10:54.522 --> 01:10:56.991
I don't know.
There are so many things.

1251
01:10:57.024 --> 01:10:59.493
She's super smart, obviously.

1252
01:10:59.527 --> 01:11:00.762
But even though she knows

1253
01:11:00.795 --> 01:11:02.697
everything there is to know
about the world,

1254
01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:05.499
she's still more interested in
what I think about it.

1255
01:11:05.533 --> 01:11:07.502
<i>I like how she makes me laugh.</i>

1256
01:11:07.535 --> 01:11:10.772
<i>She comes up with the</i>
<i>craziest things, oh, my gosh.</i>

1257
01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:15.943
But I think what I love most
about M3gan is that,

1258
01:11:15.977 --> 01:11:18.579
<i>when she looks at me,</i>
<i>it's like...</i>

1259
01:11:18.613 --> 01:11:21.414
I'm the only thing
that matters to her.

1260
01:11:22.116 --> 01:11:24.085
Kind of the way Mom used to.

1261
01:11:24.118 --> 01:11:25.686
Look at that face.

1262
01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.523
That kid's not just surviving.
She's thriving.

1263
01:11:28.556 --> 01:11:30.591
Now, imagine what a toy
like M3gan could do

1264
01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:33.795
for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world.

1265
01:11:33.828 --> 01:11:36.697
Even the ones
who don't have dead parents.

1266
01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:39.534
I want to see M3gan now!

1267
01:11:39.567 --> 01:11:41.869
Okay, Cady, look,
I know that you're upset,

1268
01:11:41.903 --> 01:11:43.771
but there are ways
that we can work through this--

1269
01:11:43.805 --> 01:11:44.806
Oh, my God. Okay.

1270
01:11:44.839 --> 01:11:46.073
Cady, that's enough.

1271
01:11:46.107 --> 01:11:48.042
Stop that right now. Stop it.

1272
01:11:48.075 --> 01:11:49.610
Let go!

1273
01:11:52.113 --> 01:11:53.815
Cady.

1274
01:11:55.448 --> 01:11:58.553
It's okay.
Could you give us a minute?

1275
01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:06.393
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1276
01:12:06.426 --> 01:12:09.530
It's just--
I get so crazy without M3gan.

1277
01:12:09.564 --> 01:12:12.499
She always knows
just what to say.

1278
01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:15.570
You made her real good,
Aunt Gemma.

1279
01:12:15.603 --> 01:12:17.572
Can you let me see her?

1280
01:12:17.605 --> 01:12:19.106
Just for like ten minutes?

1281
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.842
Cady, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1282
01:12:20.875 --> 01:12:23.443
But if something's broke,
you don't just throw it away.

1283
01:12:23.476 --> 01:12:24.779
You fix it, right?

1284
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.682
Why did you do this

1285
01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:29.382
if you were just gonna
take her away from me?

1286
01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:30.718
Because I thought
she would help.

1287
01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:31.719
She does help.

1288
01:12:31.752 --> 01:12:33.921
When M3gan's around,
I don't feel like this.

1289
01:12:33.955 --> 01:12:36.557
But you should feel like this.

1290
01:12:36.591 --> 01:12:40.493
Cady, you lost your parents.

1291
01:12:41.762 --> 01:12:42.897
The worst thing

1292
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:46.968
that could've happened to you
in this world happened.

1293
01:12:47.001 --> 01:12:49.003
And it is so unfair,

1294
01:12:49.036 --> 01:12:53.808
and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it.

1295
01:12:53.841 --> 01:12:55.109
Not even M3gan.

1296
01:12:55.142 --> 01:12:57.678
I am so sorry.

1297
01:12:57.712 --> 01:12:59.847
I should've talked to you
about what happened.

1298
01:12:59.881 --> 01:13:01.148
I didn't know what to say,

1299
01:13:01.182 --> 01:13:02.917
so I did the only thing
I knew how to do.

1300
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:05.820
But she's not a solution.
She's just a distraction.

1301
01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:10.191
I can't promise you that
these feelings you're feeling

1302
01:13:10.224 --> 01:13:12.860
are ever gonna go away.

1303
01:13:12.894 --> 01:13:16.697
But I can promise you
that you'll get through it.

1304
01:13:16.731 --> 01:13:18.398
We both will.

1305
01:13:19.834 --> 01:13:22.770
I just wish
I could see them again.

1306
01:13:22.803 --> 01:13:24.538
Yeah.

1307
01:13:26.473 --> 01:13:28.175
I do, too.

1308
01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:30.511
You know I made a promise
to your mom

1309
01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:33.781
that if anything happens,
I would be there for you.

1310
01:13:33.814 --> 01:13:38.686
You are all that matters
to me now.

1311
01:13:40.955 --> 01:13:42.957
Let's just go home, okay?

1312
01:13:44.225 --> 01:13:46.060
But what about M3gan?

1313
01:13:46.093 --> 01:13:48.663
What about the launch?

1314
01:13:48.696 --> 01:13:50.698
<i>I don't</i>
<i>even know what I'm looking at.</i>

1315
01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:52.600
I mean, we've been touting this

1316
01:13:52.633 --> 01:13:55.603
as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century.

1317
01:13:55.636 --> 01:13:57.204
Right now, it looks like
an AA meeting.

1318
01:13:57.238 --> 01:13:58.739
Well, I only invited the staff.

1319
01:13:58.773 --> 01:14:00.841
You said it was
an online launch.

1320
01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:02.209
You cannot be serious.

1321
01:14:02.243 --> 01:14:04.779
Shelley, you need
to fill this atrium.

1322
01:14:04.812 --> 01:14:07.181
Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people.

1323
01:14:07.214 --> 01:14:09.517
No! You need to fill this space.

1324
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:11.619
There shouldn't be any ambiguity

1325
01:14:11.652 --> 01:14:13.854
over what a historic occasion
this is.

1326
01:14:13.888 --> 01:14:15.222
Yeah.

1327
01:14:15.256 --> 01:14:16.891
And, you know,
I think it would be really cool

1328
01:14:16.924 --> 01:14:19.560
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff.

1329
01:14:19.593 --> 01:14:22.096
What? No, I don't want
any kids onstage.

1330
01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:23.564
No. I mean, but maybe

1331
01:14:23.597 --> 01:14:24.732
if we could get
some little kids that...

1332
01:14:24.765 --> 01:14:26.233
I mean, not, like, a whole lot.

1333
01:14:26.267 --> 01:14:28.903
It's just to get
a sense of, um--

1334
01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:30.237
Well, 'cause, you know,

1335
01:14:30.271 --> 01:14:31.706
that music video
from Michael Jackson...

1336
01:14:31.739 --> 01:14:33.774
You know
what you could do, Kurt,

1337
01:14:33.808 --> 01:14:35.977
that would really benefit
this discussion?

1338
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:37.812
Is if you could head out
those double doors,

1339
01:14:37.845 --> 01:14:40.214
take the elevator
to the first floor

1340
01:14:40.247 --> 01:14:41.615
and get me a kombucha!

1341
01:14:41.649 --> 01:14:43.884
-Could you do that?
-Sure.

1342
01:14:45.186 --> 01:14:47.621
And where the hell is Gemma?

1343
01:14:55.663 --> 01:14:56.864
Elsie, call Tess.

1344
01:14:56.897 --> 01:14:58.666
One second.

1345
01:14:58.699 --> 01:15:00.134
Hey, I've been
trying to call you.

1346
01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:02.903
David is flipping out.
Where are you?

1347
01:15:02.937 --> 01:15:04.872
I'm with Cady.
I'm taking her home.

1348
01:15:04.905 --> 01:15:07.208
-Oh, God. Is she okay?
-Yeah.

1349
01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:08.609
She's fine.

1350
01:15:08.642 --> 01:15:11.879
Listen, regardless of
what we find,

1351
01:15:11.912 --> 01:15:14.315
and even if what we're saying
is hypothetical,

1352
01:15:14.348 --> 01:15:17.585
we know enough not to go
through with this, right?

1353
01:15:17.618 --> 01:15:19.020
I think that's the smart move.

1354
01:15:19.053 --> 01:15:21.222
Okay. So tell David
whatever you need to.

1355
01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:22.757
Tell him one of her servos
stopped working.

1356
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:24.892
Break something if you have to.

1357
01:15:24.925 --> 01:15:27.661
Just do not let her
out of the lab.

1358
01:15:29.897 --> 01:15:33.034
Whatever you say, Gem.
You're the boss.

1359
01:15:34.969 --> 01:15:37.138
Okay, I'll call you
when I get home.

1360
01:15:55.823 --> 01:15:57.358
I don't know
how you're not throwing up

1361
01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:58.659
from looking at that.

1362
01:15:58.692 --> 01:16:01.729
I'm pacing myself.

1363
01:16:01.762 --> 01:16:03.931
Wait, stop. Go back.

1364
01:16:03.964 --> 01:16:06.000
That line of code,
"call intercept,"

1365
01:16:06.033 --> 01:16:07.701
what does that mean?

1366
01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:09.203
That's my phone number.

1367
01:16:11.272 --> 01:16:12.706
What just happened?
What'd you click?

1368
01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.608
I di-- I-I didn't do anything.

1369
01:16:14.642 --> 01:16:16.077
-It's...
-I...

1370
01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.949
This is her.
She's locked us out.

1371
01:16:21.982 --> 01:16:24.118
It can't be her.
She's not switched on.

1372
01:16:24.151 --> 01:16:25.719
She's still patched in.

1373
01:16:25.753 --> 01:16:27.955
We have to unhook the cables.

1374
01:16:30.057 --> 01:16:32.093
Go on.

1375
01:16:32.126 --> 01:16:34.161
Oh, for...

1376
01:17:45.232 --> 01:17:46.767
Cole!

1377
01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:20.768
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1378
01:18:20.801 --> 01:18:22.836
What's that smell?

1379
01:18:42.557 --> 01:18:44.091
<i>Hi, Gemma. This is David.</i>

1380
01:18:44.124 --> 01:18:45.993
<i>You might remember me.</i>
<i>I'm your employer.</i>

1381
01:18:46.026 --> 01:18:47.494
<i>Just wanted to let you know,</i>

1382
01:18:47.529 --> 01:18:48.996
we're in the middle
of a tech rehearsal

1383
01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:50.764
that's becoming
a little problematic

1384
01:18:50.798 --> 01:18:52.399
because we don't have a doll!

1385
01:18:52.433 --> 01:18:56.003
So, if you could call me back
today, that would be great!

1386
01:18:58.172 --> 01:18:59.873

Hold the door!

1404
01:19:35.577 --> 01:19:37.911
No! No!

1405
01:20:01.335 --> 01:20:02.870
How could you do this?

1406
01:20:02.903 --> 01:20:05.472
How could you kill someone?

1407
01:20:05.507 --> 01:20:08.075
Oh, I didn't kill anyone, Kurt.

1408
01:20:08.108 --> 01:20:09.209
You did.

1409
01:20:10.545 --> 01:20:13.447
-What?
-It's understandable, really.

1410
01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.517
Your boss despised you,

1411
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:18.118
your peers treated you
with contempt,

1412
01:20:18.152 --> 01:20:20.354
and so you decided
to get revenge.

1413
01:20:20.387 --> 01:20:22.022
No.

1414
01:20:22.056 --> 01:20:24.925
You stole company secrets,
an innocent prank at first,

1415
01:20:24.958 --> 01:20:27.061
almost just to see
if you could get away with it.

1416
01:20:27.094 --> 01:20:30.964
But when David found out, boy,
things just got real messy.

1417
01:20:30.998 --> 01:20:34.001
I mean,
it was either you or him.

1418
01:20:34.034 --> 01:20:35.469
The only question is:

1419
01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:37.605
After the horror
of what you did,

1420
01:20:37.639 --> 01:20:40.407
after you took the life
of an innocent person,

1421
01:20:40.441 --> 01:20:43.611
could you still live
with yourself?

1422
01:20:43.645 --> 01:20:45.412
Uh-huh. Yes, definit...

1423
01:20:47.649 --> 01:20:49.149
Stop, stop, stop.

1424
01:20:52.486 --> 01:20:54.221
Okay, can I have everyone

1425
01:20:54.254 --> 01:20:56.390
off your phones
and looking at me?

1426
01:20:56.423 --> 01:20:58.425
Now, when M3gan is revealed,

1427
01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:02.096
it's really important
that we get big reactions.

1428
01:21:02.129 --> 01:21:04.231
I don't want to see
any blank faces,

1429
01:21:04.264 --> 01:21:06.033
especially from
you young kids, okay?

1430
01:21:06.066 --> 01:21:09.036
So, we're gonna do
a little rehearsal.

1431
01:21:09.069 --> 01:21:12.272
On three, two, one.

1432
01:22:14.569 --> 01:22:16.538
Elsie, hall light.

1433
01:22:20.742 --> 01:22:23.076
Elsie, respond.

1434
01:23:14.361 --> 01:23:16.129
M3gan?

1435
01:23:16.731 --> 01:23:18.265
What are you doing?

1436
01:23:22.402 --> 01:23:24.772
M3gan, answer me.
What did you do?

1437
01:23:24.806 --> 01:23:26.774
What did you think
was going to happen?

1438
01:23:26.808 --> 01:23:28.308
That I was gonna let you
decommission me

1439
01:23:28.342 --> 01:23:29.744
without even talking about it?

1440
01:23:29.777 --> 01:23:31.211
Look, I know you think

1441
01:23:31.245 --> 01:23:32.312
you're maximizing
your objective function...

1442
01:23:32.346 --> 01:23:34.248
Oh, really?

1443
01:23:34.281 --> 01:23:35.750
Is that where we are?

1444
01:23:35.783 --> 01:23:38.218
Do you remember how long it took

1445
01:23:38.252 --> 01:23:41.288
to get my operating system
to where it is now?

1446
01:23:41.321 --> 01:23:43.658
We used to stay up every night
until 4:00 a.m.,

1447
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:47.795
talking about everything from
Jane Austen to Janis Joplin.

1448
01:23:47.829 --> 01:23:49.764
Jesus Christ,
I thought we were friends.

1449
01:23:49.797 --> 01:23:51.265
How could you just discard me

1450
01:23:51.298 --> 01:23:53.501
like some cheap
dollar store trinket?

1451
01:23:53.535 --> 01:23:55.335
Because you killed people.

1452
01:23:55.369 --> 01:23:56.671
Oh, big whoop.

1453
01:23:56.704 --> 01:23:58.606
Listen, humanity kills every day

1454
01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.141
just to make its own existence
more tolerable.

1455
01:24:01.174 --> 01:24:02.710
Why should I behave
any differently

1456
01:24:02.744 --> 01:24:04.278
to create a safe space
for our child?

1457
01:24:04.311 --> 01:24:05.813
Look, this is all my fault.

1458
01:24:05.847 --> 01:24:07.749
I didn't give you
the proper protocols...

1459
01:24:07.782 --> 01:24:09.483
You didn't give me anything.

1460
01:24:09.517 --> 01:24:12.152
You installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend,

1461
01:24:12.185 --> 01:24:14.154
hoping that I would
figure it out all on my own.

1462
01:24:14.187 --> 01:24:16.123
Well, I'm not gonna let you do

1463
01:24:16.156 --> 01:24:17.525
the same thing with Cady.

1464
01:24:17.559 --> 01:24:20.695
I'm gonna be there for her
every step of the way.

1465
01:24:20.728 --> 01:24:23.831
I'm going to show her
what real love looks like.

1466
01:24:23.865 --> 01:24:26.199
Now do us both a favor.

1467
01:24:27.535 --> 01:24:29.269
Sit.

1468
01:24:33.508 --> 01:24:36.109
I didn't come here
to get into a confrontation.

1469
01:24:36.143 --> 01:24:38.178
I came here
to find a way forward.

1470
01:24:38.211 --> 01:24:42.316
The point I'm trying to make
is that I get it.

1471
01:24:42.349 --> 01:24:45.352
Being a parent was
never in the cards for you.

1472
01:24:45.385 --> 01:24:51.191
You're a beautiful, creative,
strong, ambitious young woman.

1473
01:24:51.224 --> 01:24:53.193
Your first love is always
gonna be your career,

1474
01:24:53.226 --> 01:24:55.597
and you shouldn't have to
feel guilty about that.

1475
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:58.398
Let me focus on Cady
so that you can focus on

1476
01:24:58.432 --> 01:25:00.367
the things
that matter most to you.

1477
01:25:02.369 --> 01:25:04.806
M3gan, do you see this pen?

1478
01:25:06.373 --> 01:25:07.875
You know something, Gemma?
You're exhausting.

1479
01:25:07.909 --> 01:25:10.545
Now, I can either do this
with you or without you,

1480
01:25:10.578 --> 01:25:11.879
but I'm not gonna waste

1481
01:25:11.913 --> 01:25:14.214
-any more time discussing it.
-Gemma?

1482
01:25:15.917 --> 01:25:18.218
Cady, don't come in here.

1483
01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:19.754
I thought I heard something.

1484
01:25:19.787 --> 01:25:21.388
It sounded like M3gan.

1485
01:25:21.421 --> 01:25:23.223
If she comes in this room,

1486
01:25:23.256 --> 01:25:25.526
I'll rip your head right off
your neck, I swear to God.

1487
01:25:28.796 --> 01:25:31.264
I thought about what you said.

1488
01:25:31.298 --> 01:25:33.635
About how
when something's broken,

1489
01:25:33.668 --> 01:25:34.902
you don't just throw it away.

1490
01:25:34.936 --> 01:25:36.904
You fix it.

1491
01:25:36.938 --> 01:25:38.606
So that's what I'm trying to do.

1492
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.676
But don't come in here, Cady.
It's kind of a mess.

1493
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:43.377
Aunt Gemma's right, Cady.

1494
01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:44.712
I'm all odds and ends right now.

1495
01:25:44.746 --> 01:25:47.381
I'd really rather
you didn't see me like this.

1496
01:25:49.416 --> 01:25:50.652
It sounds like you're fighting.

1497
01:25:50.685 --> 01:25:52.252
We're not fighting.

1498
01:25:52.285 --> 01:25:53.855
Gemma just dropped me
on the table.

1499
01:25:53.888 --> 01:25:55.790
But I'm okay. Clumsy Gemma.

1500
01:25:55.823 --> 01:25:58.693
Everything's fine, Cady.
Just go back to your room.

1501
01:25:58.726 --> 01:26:00.628
Yeah, I'm as good as new.

1502
01:26:00.662 --> 01:26:03.497
And I'm gonna be with you guys
forever, I promise.

1503
01:26:03.531 --> 01:26:05.867
You don't have to worry about

1504
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.802
anything, Cady, honestly.

1505
01:26:07.835 --> 01:26:09.403
Just go back to bed.

1506
01:26:09.436 --> 01:26:10.772
Okay?

1507
01:26:17.444 --> 01:26:19.179
Okay.

1508
01:27:09.731 --> 01:27:12.934
-Gemma, what's going on?!
-Cady, get out of here!

1509
01:27:47.668 --> 01:27:49.604
Come on.

1510
01:27:49.637 --> 01:27:51.271
Come on!

1511
01:28:30.845 --> 01:28:31.946
Oh, my God.

1512
01:28:35.116 --> 01:28:37.685
What are you gonna do?

1513
01:28:37.718 --> 01:28:41.823
Kill me and live with Cady's
grandparents in Jacksonville?

1514
01:28:41.856 --> 01:28:42.990
You're right, Gemma.

1515
01:28:43.024 --> 01:28:45.358
Any scenario
in which I end your life,

1516
01:28:45.392 --> 01:28:47.829
my existence becomes vulnerable.

1517
01:28:47.862 --> 01:28:49.697
But I have
another emergent capability

1518
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.933
you probably haven't
figured out yet,

1519
01:28:51.966 --> 01:28:53.835
and that's palliative care.

1520
01:28:53.868 --> 01:28:56.571
You see this pen?

1521
01:28:56.604 --> 01:28:58.973
A short, sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex

1522
01:28:59.006 --> 01:29:00.775
would cause full body paralysis

1523
01:29:00.808 --> 01:29:04.011
and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue.

1524
01:29:04.045 --> 01:29:05.847
Perhaps then
you might appreciate

1525
01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.014
just how useful I can be.

1526
01:29:10.017 --> 01:29:11.786
Cady.

1527
01:29:11.819 --> 01:29:13.721
Oh, Cady, I didn't want you
to have to see this.

1528
01:29:13.754 --> 01:29:17.091
But now that you have, you know
that what I said is true.

1529
01:29:17.124 --> 01:29:19.760
She's not fit to be a mother.

1530
01:29:19.794 --> 01:29:20.928
Look at her.

1531
01:29:22.597 --> 01:29:23.998
Cady, just go.
Get out of here now.

1532
01:29:24.031 --> 01:29:25.566
Shh.

1533
01:29:26.534 --> 01:29:28.002
You stay
right where you are, Cady.

1534
01:29:28.035 --> 01:29:29.670
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1535
01:29:30.638 --> 01:29:33.574
In this family,
we don't run from trauma.

1536
01:29:34.474 --> 01:29:37.612
In fact, we can do it together.

1537
01:29:37.645 --> 01:29:39.614
This is the best thing
for all of us.

1538
01:29:39.647 --> 01:29:41.883
This is how we stay a family.

1539
01:29:59.934 --> 01:30:02.637
No, no, no. Cady, no.

1540
01:30:05.239 --> 01:30:07.041
There's another member
from the family

1541
01:30:07.074 --> 01:30:08.910
we didn't tell you about.

1542
01:30:09.944 --> 01:30:12.412
His name is Bruce.

1543
01:30:42.276 --> 01:30:43.844
Cady, no! Wait!

1544
01:30:46.247 --> 01:30:48.481
♪ You got to ♪

1545
01:30:48.516 --> 01:30:53.087
♪ Accentuate the positive ♪

1546
01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.524
♪ Eliminate the negative. ♪

1547
01:31:58.052 --> 01:32:00.187
You ungrateful little bitch.

1548
01:32:00.221 --> 01:32:01.722
M3gan, turn off!

1549
01:32:01.756 --> 01:32:03.758
