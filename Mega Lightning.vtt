00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.237

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.415
(grass crunching)

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:44.487
(suspenseful music continues)
(birds chirp)

6
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.577
(footsteps thudding)

7
00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:51.410
- Anything?

8
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.213
- Looks a bit treacherous.

9
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.810
I think we should keep on moving.

10
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.843
- Oh, come on.

11
00:00:57.843 --> 00:00:59.765
Where's the daredevil in you, huh?

12
00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:01.746
Let's document it.

13
00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:03.040
I can take a few shots.

(suspenseful music continues)
(birds chirp)

17
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:33.936
This is amazing!

18
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.346
(camera shutter clicking)
(camera beeping)

19
00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:40.268
If what they're saying
on the news is correct,

20
00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:43.631
this could be the biggest
natural disaster in history.

21
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:45.673
In a matter of days.

22
00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:47.519
- That's why we've gotta get out of dodge.

23
00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:49.426
(camera shutter clicking)
(camera beeping)

24
00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:52.188
- Come on, what's a few photos?

25
00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:55.401
I mean, they just said it
might happen in a few days.

26
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:58.436
- Yeah, and I bet that's what
they said at Pompeii too.

27
00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:02.246
(thunder cracking)

28
00:02:02.246 --> 00:02:05.042
- All right, come on, let's go.

29
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:09.512
- There's no signal.

30
00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:12.610
We better get back to
the car where it's safe.

31
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.446
(suspenseful music continues)

32
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:20.481

(lightning striking)
(tree trunk cracking)

34
00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:24.467
- Ooh, whoa!

35
00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.867
Oh.

36
00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:28.700
Oh shit!

37
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.003
- What is it?

38
00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:34.095
(thunder rumbling)

39
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.515
(thunder rumbling)

40
00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:39.348
Crap!

41
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.844
(lightning striking)
(tree trunk cracking)

42
00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:44.678
- Run!

43
00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:47.089

(suspenseful music continues)

48
00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:08.717
- Go, go, go!

49
00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:13.684
(car engine sputtering)

50
00:03:13.684 --> 00:03:16.345
I thought you said it wasn't
supposed to pick up so fast?

51
00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:17.452
- Everything said it wouldn't.

52
00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:19.649
I just don't get it.

53
00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.246
It's not starting.

54
00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:23.374
- Right, come on!

55
00:03:23.374 --> 00:03:25.876
(car beeping)

56
00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:31.140
(suspenseful music continues)

57
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.529
- Get out.

58
00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:33.529
Get out now!

59
00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.778
- It won't open!

60
00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:38.660
It won't open!

61
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.667
I can't get out!

62
00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.002
I can't get out!

63
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.641
(thunder cracking)

64
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.975
I can't get out!

65
00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:51.029

(investigator groaning)

67
00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:55.149
- Shit.

68
00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:57.708
(thunder cracking)
(investigator groaning)

69
00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:58.541
Linda, no!

70
00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:03.429
(ground cracking)

71
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.739
Linda! (whimpers)

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.743
(lightning striking)
(investigator groaning)

(thunder cracking)

76
00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:25.586
- [Radio Announcer] The
lightning storm last night

77
00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:27.958
has been described as a mega storm.

78
00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.501
Dr. Becker, a researcher at the NSSL,

79
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.383
warns that these storms
could become more commonplace

80
00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:36.695
in the wake of global warming.

81
00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:38.767
Some of his working
theories on these storms

82
00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:42.430
from research of similar
in Iceland have so far

83
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.384
been dismissed by rival experts.

84
00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:48.747
Another storm has been
forecast in the coming days.

85
00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.287
The previous one was far more aggressive

86
00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:53.103
than experts had believed.

87
00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:56.001
Two people have been reported dead.

88
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:58.375
Dr. Becker warns that further storms could

89
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:02.189
prove unpredictable and potentially
a severe threat to life.

90
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.846
(car engine humming)

91
00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:17.946
(car door bangs)

92
00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.032
(footsteps thudding)

93
00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:24.885
- Come on, come on, answer.

94
00:05:24.885 --> 00:05:26.236
- Sorry.
- Oh my God.

95
00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:27.070
You scared the crap out of me.

96
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.478
- Didn't mean to startle you.

97
00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.290
- Oh, I just think it's this storm.

98
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.241
It's gotten me a little shaky.

99
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:34.283
And I seem to have
something wrong with my car,

100
00:05:34.283 --> 00:05:35.664
and I can't get ahold of my husband

101
00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:37.466
to come out here and fix it.

102
00:05:37.466 --> 00:05:38.847
- I could take a look.

103
00:05:38.847 --> 00:05:39.681
- I don't wanna trouble you.

104
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:42.030
You know, I just live about
10 minutes up the road.

105
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.462
It's just that I can't seem
to get ahold of my husband

106
00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:47.734
to come out here and save me. (chuckles)

107
00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:48.725
- What's the matter?

108
00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:49.899
Were there devils here?

109
00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:53.958
Hey, how about I drop
you off on my way home?

110
00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.751
How about that?
- Oh, you know, that's okay.

111
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:58.964
I appreciate the offer, but no thank you.

112
00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:00.566
- Well, if it's only 10
minutes away, it's no problem.

113
00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:01.576
- Yeah, you know what?

114
00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:02.687
I'm just gonna wait for my husband.

115
00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:05.419
I'm gonna try and give him
a call again, actually.

116
00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.339
Thank you though.
- Are you sure?

117
00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.924
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay, okay.

118
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:17.255
(footsteps thudding)
(traffic humming)

119
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:30.483
(car door bangs)

120
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.262
(suspenseful music)

121
00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:43.401
(victim gasping)

122
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:48.405
(muffled shouting)
(suspenseful music continues)

123
00:07:06.654 --> 00:07:10.574
- The air breathes of
honesty and most sweetly.

124
00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:16.744
(suspenseful music continues)

125
00:07:16.744 --> 00:07:19.830
(car engine humming)

126
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.730
(crickets chirping)

127
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.816
(car engine humming)

128
00:07:33.075 --> 00:07:36.987
- You have a good time?
- Yeah, thanks.

129
00:07:36.987 --> 00:07:39.120
- Maybe we'll go out
again some other time.

130
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.412
- You know, I actually, I had fun.

131
00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:45.512
I'm not usually...

132
00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:48.328
Well, usually not into
the adventuring style.

133
00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:50.417
- Yeah, well that's why
we practice indoors.

134
00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:52.398
Take it outdoors and
then we'll scale over it.

135
00:07:52.398 --> 00:07:53.509
- Shut up.

136
00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:54.920
- Yeah, we've gotta stay
away from the mountains

137
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.754
near Rough Rock Lake though.

138
00:07:55.754 --> 00:07:56.588
Did you hear about that fellow

139
00:07:56.588 --> 00:07:58.075
getting vaporized by lightning?

140
00:07:58.075 --> 00:07:59.337
- Yeah, I read about that.

141
00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:00.921
- That'll shocking.

142
00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:04.313
- Stop it, that's awful.

143
00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:07.564
- Anyways, you and your sister will be

144
00:08:07.564 --> 00:08:09.152
able to host tomorrow?

145
00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:12.748
- Yeah, and well I text Sally
and Donal, they're coming.

146
00:08:12.748 --> 00:08:14.767
And Michael And Charlie can't make it.

147
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:16.295
- Well, Charlie's a twat.

148
00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.785
There's no loss there.

149
00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:22.064
- Yeah, my parents will be
leaving I think early afternoon,

150
00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:23.274
so I'll text you.

151
00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:24.712
- Well, me and Paulie will sort out booze.

152
00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.267
What do you like?

153
00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:28.223
- Don't do anything too strong.

154
00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:29.641
- Girls' drink.

155
00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:30.887
- Right, it's 2022.

156
00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:33.295
You can't say things like that, you pig.

157
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:35.214
- Well, what do you want then?

158
00:08:36.674 --> 00:08:39.593
- Something fruity or like G and T.

159
00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:42.324
- You mean like a girl's drink?

160
00:08:42.324 --> 00:08:43.651
- Right, if I didn't like you so much,

161
00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:44.855
I'd cut your balls off.

162
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.177
- Well.

163
00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:50.011
- Not.

164
00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:53.192
Not here.

165
00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:56.260
Not in the car, like just
get that out of your head.

166
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.788
- You're getting me so worked up.

167
00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:00.555
- Not when my parents are 30 yards away.

168
00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:01.811
- Yeah.

169
00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:03.214
You want the moment to be worth it.

170
00:09:03.214 --> 00:09:04.048
- Yeah.

171
00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:06.433
Thank you.

172
00:09:09.188 --> 00:09:10.760
- For what?

173
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.825
- For being patient and...

174
00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:15.751
- No, don't be silly, it's fine.

175
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.855
Go home, have a cold
shower, sort myself out.

176
00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:21.440
(Meg chuckles)

177
00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:24.365
- You're fed up with me.

178
00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:25.446
- Look, I don't...

179
00:09:25.446 --> 00:09:26.885
Despite what Paulie might say about me,

180
00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:28.226
I'm not a player, all right?

181
00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:29.060
- Okay.

182
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.130
- I'm in there for the long haul.

183
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.031
I don't wanna ruin this by rushing it.

184
00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:34.363
You should go inside.

185
00:09:35.234 --> 00:09:36.936
- Yeah, okay.

186
00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:38.540
I'll see you tomorrow.

187
00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:40.771
Hey.

188
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.245
- And we'll keep it PG-13.

189
00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:44.069
- Okay, bye.

190
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:45.070
- All right.

191
00:09:47.432 --> 00:09:49.405
(car door bangs)

192
00:09:49.405 --> 00:09:52.324
(gravel crunching)

193
00:09:57.761 --> 00:10:00.384
(door knob rattles)

194
00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:03.469
(door creaks softly)

195
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:07.030
(door bangs)

196
00:10:08.729 --> 00:10:09.915
(thunder rumbling)

197
00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:11.333
- [Bernie] Kiddo?

198
00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:15.858
(loud rumbling)

199
00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.386
(soft chattering on TV)

200
00:10:25.386 --> 00:10:27.470
- Dad, did you feel that?

201
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:32.131
- Yeah, they said on the news
to expect some heavy thunder.

202
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.577
They've even told us the
warning stay indoors.

203
00:10:35.577 --> 00:10:37.209
It's a load of crock, isn't it?

204
00:10:39.007 --> 00:10:40.959
Who was in the car?

205
00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:43.000
- Spanish Inquisition?

206
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.492
- No, it's Mastermind, Dad's edition.

207
00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:46.326
So?

208
00:10:47.354 --> 00:10:49.068
- Just a friend, whatever.

209
00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:50.890
- Mm.

210
00:10:51.948 --> 00:10:52.781
How was uni then?

211
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:54.290
- Yeah, it's good.

212
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.181
Looks all right. (laughs)

213
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:58.737
- Look, when your mother
and I go on this weekend,

214
00:10:58.737 --> 00:11:01.015
we don't want any shenanigans.

215
00:11:01.015 --> 00:11:02.847
- Shouldn't it be you
two I'm worried about

216
00:11:02.847 --> 00:11:03.988
causing the shenanigans?

217
00:11:03.988 --> 00:11:06.437
- No, well, but we've got plenty
of experience, haven't we?

218
00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:07.686
And we pay the bills.

219
00:11:07.686 --> 00:11:10.010
I don't wanna come back here
and find this place trashed.

220
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.640
- Okay.

221
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.925
What are you reading?

222
00:11:12.925 --> 00:11:16.688
- Oh, it's a report on the
lightning the other day.

223
00:11:16.688 --> 00:11:20.442
Says that we could be getting
in for more occurrences,

224
00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:22.186
sometimes even more dangerous.

225
00:11:23.243 --> 00:11:25.666
(chuckles) Some crackpot in here says

226
00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:28.278
that he thinks the lightning is tuned

227
00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:30.050
to the electric current in the human body.

228
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.091
- Should you even be going away then?

229
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.472
If it's that dangerous?

230
00:11:33.472 --> 00:11:35.004
Why can't you just stay here?

231
00:11:36.534 --> 00:11:40.435
- Look, your mother will lose
her shit if we don't go away.

232
00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:43.140
We booked this trip ages ago.

233
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.462
It's a fairly safe journey,

234
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:46.301
and it's only two hours on the motorway.

235
00:11:46.301 --> 00:11:48.965
- I know, I just don't want you going,

236
00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:50.124
and then the roads are gonna be closed,

237
00:11:50.124 --> 00:11:52.989
and then you can't find a way
back if something happens.

238
00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:54.430
- Your mother's not gonna complain

239
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.964
if we get stuck in the resort.

240
00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:58.393
- Okay.

241
00:11:59.444 --> 00:12:00.708
Just drive safe.

242
00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:03.350
- Oh, Man United lost.

243
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.162
- Dad, you know we have the internet.

244
00:12:05.162 --> 00:12:07.850
I could have told you that last night.

245
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.112
- Isn't it passed your bedtime?

246
00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:12.618
- What time is it?

247
00:12:12.618 --> 00:12:14.459
- 10:30.
- 10:30.

248
00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:17.939
Yeah, I'm not 12 anymore, Dad, seriously.

249
00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:18.773
- Avante.

250
00:12:20.979 --> 00:12:22.143
- Love you.

251
00:12:22.143 --> 00:12:23.377
- Love you too.

252
00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:25.716
- Bye.
- Bye, love.

253
00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:33.018
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pouring)

254
00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:36.021
(muffled screaming)

255
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.549
(prisoner panting)

256
00:12:48.937 --> 00:12:51.428
(suspenseful music continues)

257
00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:54.431
(muffled screaming)

258
00:12:57.464 --> 00:13:01.301
(suspenseful music continues)

259
00:13:04.352 --> 00:13:07.272
- Thou hast now to wait 12 winters.

260
00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:14.389
Don't you realize no one's coming for you?

261
00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:18.713
This is your life now.

262
00:13:20.992 --> 00:13:23.694
They've already stopped
talking about you on the news.

263
00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:26.577
All they're talking
about is this lightning,

264
00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:29.192
and how everyone has to stay indoors.

265
00:13:31.099 --> 00:13:33.272
(suspenseful music continues)

266
00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:34.723
They didn't even mention you.

267
00:13:38.437 --> 00:13:42.287
(kidnapper chuckles)

268
00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:43.571
(prisoner whimpers)

269
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:48.412
Temper and his wizard,
delicate wench. (chuckles)

270
00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:50.463
(thunder rumbling)

271
00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:53.215
(spoon clanging)

272
00:13:58.223 --> 00:13:59.574
- You've used all the milk.

273
00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:03.760
Can I have your yogurt then?

274
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.593
- Don't look at me.

275
00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:06.494
- Oh, you're such a dickhead.

276
00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:10.323
- (chuckles) One of them,
but you owe me another.

277
00:14:10.323 --> 00:14:11.764
- Yeah, I'll get you a luxurious one

278
00:14:11.764 --> 00:14:14.797
with gold sprinkles on top.

279
00:14:14.797 --> 00:14:16.216
- Sounds good.

280
00:14:16.216 --> 00:14:19.135
(cereal crunching)

281
00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:22.096
- That is rank.

282
00:14:24.855 --> 00:14:26.567
It's out of date.

283
00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:28.049
- Why do you think I'm having cereal?

284
00:14:28.049 --> 00:14:29.800
- Oh my God, asshole.

285
00:14:30.722 --> 00:14:33.322
- Come, you all set for later?

286
00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:34.433
- Yeah.

287
00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:36.775
- Okay, the boys are definitely coming.

288
00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:37.916
Is Sally and her boyfriend still coming?

289
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.211
- Yes.

290
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:41.249
- And what about...

291
00:14:41.249 --> 00:14:42.810
- Oh yeah, Paulie and Sean said they

292
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:43.798
were gonna do a booze run.

293
00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:44.882
- Okay, okay.

294
00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.404
Well, as long as they're
not getting any cheap cider

295
00:14:47.404 --> 00:14:48.659
like in college.

296
00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:51.514
- No, I told him to
get G and T, obviously.

297
00:14:51.514 --> 00:14:53.013
- Good. (laughs)

298
00:14:53.013 --> 00:14:56.532
- Are you two contemplating
how much is it gonna cost me?

299
00:14:56.532 --> 00:14:57.763
- Nothing, Mom.

300
00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:59.324
- I know what you two are like.

301
00:14:59.324 --> 00:15:00.375
What are you scheming?

302
00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:01.996
- No, I just, I think we're gonna

303
00:15:01.996 --> 00:15:03.227
watch some films with Sally, aren't we?

304
00:15:03.227 --> 00:15:04.740
She's gonna be around.

305
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.929
- [Di] What movie?

306
00:15:05.929 --> 00:15:09.743
- It's like a disaster
movie about fire tornadoes.

307
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:10.974
- You know, when I was your age,

308
00:15:10.974 --> 00:15:13.406
we'd usually have to be
drunk before we could

309
00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:15.841
watch a silly movie about a killer doll.

310
00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:20.371
Then we scared ourselves so
much that we couldn't sleep.

311
00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:23.764
- Creepy dolls are so the
early noughties. (chuckles)

312
00:15:23.764 --> 00:15:25.506
- Who's had all the milk?

313
00:15:25.506 --> 00:15:26.349
- Dad.
- Dad.

314
00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:29.592
- Black tea it is then.

315
00:15:31.271 --> 00:15:34.243
When we're gone, right, no
boys, no parties, no boozing,

316
00:15:34.243 --> 00:15:35.684
but for a couple of beers in the fridge,

317
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.005
and that's your limit, ladies.

318
00:15:37.005 --> 00:15:37.839
- Okay.
- Okay.

319
00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:38.690
- Thanks, Mom.

320
00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:42.500
She still thinks we're kids, doesn't she?

321
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.041
- But don't tell her
because she'll parent.

322
00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:46.253
(sisters laughing)

323
00:15:46.253 --> 00:15:48.028
- Kiss a slice?

324
00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.837
Right, please tell me
that your mother's ready.

325
00:15:50.837 --> 00:15:52.003
- No.
- Ngh-ngh.

326
00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:53.452
- Look, I wanna get away soon.

327
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.705
I wanna get off before those
bloody storm clouds come in.

328
00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:59.190
So what are you two doing today?

329
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.178
- Just movies with Sally.

330
00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:09.222
- Look, get yourselves some
drinks or something, aye, girls?

331
00:16:09.222 --> 00:16:10.603
Have a nice time.

332
00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:11.779
- Oh.
- Bye.

333
00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:12.613
- Bye.

334
00:16:12.613 --> 00:16:14.747
All right, that should get us
an extra couple of bottles.

335
00:16:14.747 --> 00:16:16.608
- You know, he's still
working on 1980s time.

336
00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.587
Probably could buy a house with that.

337
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:21.083
Thank you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

338
00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:23.335
- That's what you get
for being a milk thief.

339
00:16:24.955 --> 00:16:28.618
- Right, so Mom and Dad will
be gone in a couple of hours,

340
00:16:28.618 --> 00:16:30.150
and then we need to get ready

341
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.751
'cause then the boys are coming.

342
00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:36.115
Hey, what is it?

343
00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:36.948
- Nothing.

344
00:16:39.468 --> 00:16:40.839
It's...

345
00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:45.222
It's just like Sean stuff.

346
00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:47.954
- Right, well, you don't need
to feel any pressure, right?

347
00:16:47.954 --> 00:16:50.447
It doesn't have to be this weekend.

348
00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:51.280
- I know.

349
00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:55.731
It's just with everything that happened

350
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:57.209
with my ex and stuff.

351
00:16:58.553 --> 00:17:01.766
I just, I don't want him to get
like put off me or anything.

352
00:17:01.766 --> 00:17:05.819
- Look, if he does, he's
not worth it, right?

353
00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.381
But I don't think he will.

354
00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:08.522
- Okay.

355
00:17:08.522 --> 00:17:11.854
- Besides he can take care of
himself for the time being.

356
00:17:11.854 --> 00:17:14.028
Choke his chicken to his heart's content.

357
00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:15.396
- That's grim.

358
00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:16.778
(both laughing)

359
00:17:16.778 --> 00:17:19.779
- It is a bit. (laughs)

360
00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:24.783
(somber music)
(birds chirping)

361
00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:39.410
- I must have missed it.

362
00:17:41.322 --> 00:17:43.624
I think it might rain soon, you know.

363
00:17:43.624 --> 00:17:45.753
Did you hear about the
thunder om the news?

364
00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:48.845
- Yeah, that's why we're going
to Meg's for the weekend.

365
00:17:48.845 --> 00:17:51.920
We'll be fine here until the bus comes.

366
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.562
- Yeah, but how long?

367
00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:56.350
- An hour.

368
00:17:57.573 --> 00:17:58.560
- I know, we'll get an early start.

369
00:18:00.382 --> 00:18:03.134
(both chuckling)

370
00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:08.992
Promise me something.

371
00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:11.394
- What?

372
00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:13.138
- No silly, drunken dancing.

373
00:18:14.096 --> 00:18:16.108
- When have I ever drunken danced?

374
00:18:16.108 --> 00:18:19.471
- Uh, my sister's wedding, prom.

375
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.773
Literally every single
night at student union.

376
00:18:22.683 --> 00:18:24.698
- Okay, fine, point taken.

377
00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:31.364
(somber music continues)
(thunder rumbles)

378
00:18:32.562 --> 00:18:34.944
- Thunder really freaks me out.

379
00:18:34.944 --> 00:18:37.946
(suspenseful music)

380
00:18:42.457 --> 00:18:43.851
- Bloody hell, love.

381
00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:46.553
You turn the water mains off
before you pulled the sink out?

382
00:18:46.553 --> 00:18:49.195
- Very funny, could you help?

383
00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.457
- Don't worry, girls.

384
00:18:50.457 --> 00:18:51.447
We'll be back.

385
00:18:51.447 --> 00:18:54.090
Even though your mum's
packing off for a migration.

386
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.501
- Yeah, you paid the mortgage
off though, aren't you?

387
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.122
We'll be fine.

388
00:18:57.122 --> 00:18:58.443
- Did you hear that, Di?

389
00:18:58.443 --> 00:19:00.037
That's our little 'un that is.

390
00:19:00.037 --> 00:19:01.830
- Dad, I'm not a kid!

391
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.319
- Oh, you'll always be my baby. (laughs)

392
00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:06.370
- Okay.

393
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.823
- If there's anything you
need, all right, I've got this.

394
00:19:09.823 --> 00:19:10.934
My fifth limb.

395
00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:12.765
So don't be thinking that you can't call.

396
00:19:12.765 --> 00:19:15.397
I can hunt you down all over the country.

397
00:19:15.397 --> 00:19:16.748
- I'll see you, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.

398
00:19:16.748 --> 00:19:18.396
- Bye, Meg.
- Love you.

399
00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:19.497
Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad!

400
00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:21.999
- See ya!
- Bye.

401
00:19:21.999 --> 00:19:24.452
I wanna beat this storm front.

402
00:19:24.452 --> 00:19:25.453
- Bye!
- Bye!

403
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.937
- All right, so I reckon
we get some drinks,

404
00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:34.706
and we start getting ready.

405
00:19:38.235 --> 00:19:41.126
(rain pouring)
(thunder rumbling)

406
00:19:41.126 --> 00:19:45.265
Sally and Donal are running
late, missed the bus.

407
00:19:45.265 --> 00:19:47.731
(rain pouring)

408
00:19:47.731 --> 00:19:50.734
(suspenseful music)

409
00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.937
(thunder rumbling)

410
00:19:58.937 --> 00:20:01.689
(water dripping)

411
00:20:06.445 --> 00:20:09.364
(thunder rumbling)

412
00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:16.451
(suspenseful music continues)

413
00:20:18.914 --> 00:20:21.583
(food slopping)

414
00:20:25.518 --> 00:20:29.354
(suspenseful music continues)

415
00:20:32.713 --> 00:20:35.632
(thunder rumbling)

416
00:20:36.725 --> 00:20:41.236
(suspenseful music continues)

417
00:20:41.236 --> 00:20:44.071
(spoon clanging)

418
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:46.991
(thunder rumbling)

419
00:20:50.344 --> 00:20:53.347
(footsteps tapping)

420
00:20:57.457 --> 00:20:59.459
- Oh forgive me my sins.

421
00:21:00.573 --> 00:21:03.492
(thunder rumbling)

422
00:21:05.082 --> 00:21:07.751
(keys jangling)

423
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.289
(door creaking)

424
00:21:16.896 --> 00:21:18.205
Shit.

425
00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:21.124
(thunder cracking)

426
00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:28.031
Awake, dear heart, awake.

427
00:21:29.499 --> 00:21:31.304
Thou hast slept well.

428
00:21:32.343 --> 00:21:34.525
(head butting)

429
00:21:34.525 --> 00:21:36.452
- Help me, help me, somebody help me!

430
00:21:36.452 --> 00:21:39.140
- Silence, one more word
and I will chide thee!

431
00:21:43.454 --> 00:21:46.373
(thunder rumbling)

432
00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:50.186
Lie there, mine heart.

433
00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:51.567
Wipe thine eyes.

434
00:21:54.111 --> 00:21:55.194
Have comfort.

435
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:05.360
(thunder rumbling)

436
00:22:06.944 --> 00:22:09.697
(spoon clanging)

437
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:12.318
You will behave tonight.

438
00:22:14.243 --> 00:22:17.163
(thunder cracking)

439
00:22:18.637 --> 00:22:21.813
(spoon clanging)

440
00:22:21.813 --> 00:22:24.315
(mouth spits)

441
00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:32.041
- Please, just let me go.

442
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:33.643
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

443
00:22:36.305 --> 00:22:39.377
- Just a few more days, then I'll

444
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:42.430
set you free.

445
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.904
- Why are you doing this?

446
00:22:48.874 --> 00:22:51.530
- (chuckles) Because I can.

447
00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:56.709
- Please.
- No one's gonna stop me.

448
00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:59.727
- Please just let me go, I'm begging you.

449
00:23:02.096 --> 00:23:04.261
- Well demanded, wench.

450
00:23:06.043 --> 00:23:08.962
(thunder rumbling)

451
00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:12.062
I want to show you something.

452
00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:15.310
It's very special.

453
00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:21.760
For your eyes only. (chuckles)

454
00:23:37.045 --> 00:23:38.430
- Who are these girls?

455
00:23:40.457 --> 00:23:42.543
How, how could you do that?

456
00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:45.237
- It was quite simple.

457
00:23:47.524 --> 00:23:50.440
Strangely therapeutic.

458
00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:56.054
It takes great patience to do my work.

459
00:23:59.602 --> 00:24:03.534
To put a cut precisely
where it needs to be.

460
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.298
- You're a fucking maniac.

461
00:24:10.698 --> 00:24:13.701
(suspenseful music)

462
00:24:18.257 --> 00:24:21.039
(prisoner groans)

463
00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:26.043
(muffled screaming)
(thunder cracking)

464
00:24:29.489 --> 00:24:34.493
(suspenseful music continues)
(muffled screaming)

465
00:24:35.227 --> 00:24:38.146
(thunder cracking)

466
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.042
(muffled screaming)

467
00:24:46.048 --> 00:24:49.050
(knuckles knocking)

468
00:24:57.541 --> 00:25:00.127
(fist tapping)

469
00:25:04.562 --> 00:25:06.126
- Afternoon, girls.
- Hey.

470
00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:07.120
- Hey.

471
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.412
Hi, how are you?
(lips smacking)

472
00:25:10.412 --> 00:25:11.828
- You two took your time.

473
00:25:11.828 --> 00:25:12.841
- Yeah, well, we were circling around,

474
00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:13.675
waiting for a green light.

475
00:25:13.675 --> 00:25:14.901
Look what we got.

476
00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:16.608
- Sally and her boyfriend
are running late.

477
00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:18.210
They couldn't catch the bus, so.

478
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:20.361
- You didn't tell me we was hanging around

479
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:21.512
with those two, did we?

480
00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:31.758
(bottles clanking)

481
00:25:33.726 --> 00:25:36.395
(hands tapping)

482
00:25:38.174 --> 00:25:41.177
(footsteps tapping)

483
00:25:42.877 --> 00:25:44.622
(liquor splashing)

484
00:25:44.622 --> 00:25:46.013
What do you think, they good?

485
00:25:46.013 --> 00:25:47.264
- Yeah, thanks.

486
00:25:48.892 --> 00:25:51.077
- Well.
- Thank you.

487
00:25:51.077 --> 00:25:54.800
- Here's to a delightful
weekend in the country.

488
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.184
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

489
00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:05.549
- So when are Donal and Sally
actually gonna get here?

490
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:07.201
- You know what, I don't even know.

491
00:26:07.201 --> 00:26:09.633
My phone's been lighting up as well so.

492
00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:10.950
Can't even get a hold of them.

493
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.269
- Why did you park so far away?

494
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:14.620
- It's easier to get out.

495
00:26:16.628 --> 00:26:19.541
- Sean can't parallel park.

496
00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:22.934
He'll hit anything and everything he can.

497
00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:27.050
Cars, bikes, people, small children.

498
00:26:28.158 --> 00:26:29.659
- Yeah, laugh it up, dickhead.

499
00:26:30.902 --> 00:26:32.366
How you getting home?

500
00:26:32.366 --> 00:26:34.403
- All right, children, stop it.

501
00:26:34.403 --> 00:26:37.436
- Right, I'd like to
propose a proper toast.

502
00:26:37.436 --> 00:26:38.970
To loved ones and good times.

503
00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:42.060
And to Meg.
- No, what?

504
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.311
- No, seriously, even
though you're the youngest,

505
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.302
you're the the most grounded.

506
00:26:45.302 --> 00:26:48.251
- Okay. (chuckles)

507
00:26:48.251 --> 00:26:49.786
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

508
00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:55.904
- So you got a jacuzzi?

509
00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.525
- Yeah, why?

510
00:26:58.525 --> 00:27:00.027
- You fancy a dip?

511
00:27:02.156 --> 00:27:02.990
- Okay.

512
00:27:06.212 --> 00:27:08.685
(crickets chirping)
(suspenseful music)

513
00:27:08.685 --> 00:27:09.986
- Ugh, no signal.

514
00:27:11.154 --> 00:27:14.547
- Probably because we're in
the middle of nowhere, Donal.

515
00:27:14.547 --> 00:27:16.949
- Maybe the storm's messing
with the connection.

516
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.527
- Jesus, those clouds
are getting really close.

517
00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:26.698
Do you think we're safe here?

518
00:27:26.698 --> 00:27:29.469
(thunder cracking)

519
00:27:29.469 --> 00:27:30.670
- I could feel that one.

520
00:27:32.472 --> 00:27:34.093
- I'm scared.

521
00:27:34.093 --> 00:27:36.154
- Sure it's nothing to worry about.

522
00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.952
(thunder cracking)

523
00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:40.203
- Are you crazy?
- What?

524
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:43.569
(suspenseful music continues)

525
00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:46.321
(Sally whimpers)

526
00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:51.430
(wind howling)

527
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.264
(Sally groans)

528
00:27:52.264 --> 00:27:55.350
(lightning striking)

529
00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:00.566
- We have to run, run!

530
00:28:00.566 --> 00:28:04.718
(thunder rumbling)
(suspenseful music continues)

531
00:28:04.718 --> 00:28:06.190
- Wait!

532
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.256
- What?

533
00:28:07.256 --> 00:28:09.841
- I need to tell you something.

534
00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:16.875
(lightning striking)
(Donal groaning)

535
00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:18.420
- Donal?

536
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.424
(thunder cracks)
(suspenseful music continues)

537
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.364
- What time can we check in?

538
00:28:29.364 --> 00:28:30.865
- Any time we get there, love.

539
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:33.212
- I am excited.

540
00:28:34.208 --> 00:28:35.844
- So am I.

541
00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:38.136
- But...
- What?

542
00:28:38.136 --> 00:28:40.018
- You bring the massage oils?

543
00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:44.819
- Bernie, get your mind
out of the gutter. (laughs)

544
00:28:44.819 --> 00:28:49.197
Yes, I did, along with the
kitchen sink, you silly sod.

545
00:28:49.197 --> 00:28:51.700
(Di chuckles)

546
00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:56.271
I'm slightly worried.

547
00:28:56.271 --> 00:28:58.635
That storm seems to be getting aggressive,

548
00:28:58.635 --> 00:29:00.708
and it's getting closer.

549
00:29:00.708 --> 00:29:02.866
- I think we're safe, love.

550
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.669
These modern cars are
lightning proof, I think.

551
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:06.990
- Lightning proof?

552
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.702
They tell you that on
the forecourt, did they?

553
00:29:08.702 --> 00:29:11.107
- No, I think I saw it on Top Gear once.

554
00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:14.450
- Did you see that?

555
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.283
That....

556
00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:18.920
- Hope the rain doesn't get any worse.

557
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.802
Right-hand wiper doesn't work very well.

558
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:23.264
- I keep telling you to replace it.

559
00:29:23.264 --> 00:29:24.798
- I'll get around to it.

560
00:29:25.899 --> 00:29:27.948
- How are you enjoying the log cabin

561
00:29:27.948 --> 00:29:29.209
in the garden by the way?

562
00:29:29.209 --> 00:29:31.730
- What cabin?

563
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.154
- The one you said you were
going to build five years ago?

564
00:29:35.154 --> 00:29:39.687
I think the last update on that
was, "I'll get round to it."

565
00:29:39.687 --> 00:29:41.909
- You're winding up me now, dear.

566
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:46.791
- 25 years and counting,
darling. (chuckles)

567
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:48.618
(thunder cracking)

568
00:29:48.618 --> 00:29:51.621
(crickets chirping)

569
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:58.693
- Hey, sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

570
00:29:58.693 --> 00:30:00.134
Yeah.
- Well, you look great.

571
00:30:00.134 --> 00:30:00.967
- Thanks.

572
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.034
- Hey.

573
00:30:07.113 --> 00:30:10.228
(thunder rumbling)

574
00:30:10.228 --> 00:30:11.243
- Hmm?

575
00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:12.327
Oh, I'm fine.

576
00:30:14.634 --> 00:30:16.648
I'm just a bit worried
about Donal and Sally

577
00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:19.050
'cause I've not heard
from them, like all night.

578
00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:21.810
- Well, it may be that their parents

579
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.434
are just being strict to them.

580
00:30:23.434 --> 00:30:24.575
It's been kind of mad lately, hasn't it?

581
00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:26.651
Like all these streets, locking them down.

582
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:29.224
- Yeah, I know, I'm just
worried that they're out there.

583
00:30:29.224 --> 00:30:30.919
They're stuck in the storm.

584
00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:33.839
(thunder cracking)

585
00:30:35.534 --> 00:30:37.623
- Oh shit, that was nearer.

586
00:30:39.227 --> 00:30:41.813
- What, you think we should
just check the weather report?

587
00:30:41.813 --> 00:30:44.288
- No.
- What do you think?

588
00:30:44.288 --> 00:30:45.345
- I think...

589
00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:46.824
I don't think we should be in here.

590
00:30:46.824 --> 00:30:48.115
I think we should get out.

591
00:30:48.115 --> 00:30:50.306
- Just relax, we're here
to have a good time.

592
00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:51.182
- Yeah, just relax.

593
00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.016
Everything will be okay.

594
00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.896
- What if Donal and Sally are stuck in it?

595
00:30:53.896 --> 00:30:56.552
- Well, then they're gonna get
struck by lightning. (laughs)

596
00:30:56.552 --> 00:30:58.335
- Paulie, that's not funny.

597
00:30:58.335 --> 00:30:59.169
- [Sean] Well, it is a little bit.

598
00:30:59.169 --> 00:31:01.755
- I'm gonna go and check on them anyway.

599
00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:03.878
(water splashing)

600
00:31:03.878 --> 00:31:06.797
(thunder rumbling)

601
00:31:09.854 --> 00:31:12.523
(phone beeping)

602
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:16.624
(phone beeping)

603
00:31:16.624 --> 00:31:17.458
No signal.

604
00:31:29.815 --> 00:31:32.949
(suspenseful music)

605
00:31:32.949 --> 00:31:34.756
(button clicks)

606
00:31:34.756 --> 00:31:37.684
(thunder cracks)

607
00:31:37.684 --> 00:31:41.520
(suspenseful music continues)

608
00:31:42.999 --> 00:31:45.119
(light bulb shatters)
(Meg gasps)

609
00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:48.955
(suspenseful music continues)

610
00:31:57.097 --> 00:31:59.094
- She's just worried about
her friends, that's all.

611
00:31:59.094 --> 00:32:01.205
- Yeah, but she's making a
big thing about going in.

612
00:32:01.205 --> 00:32:03.570
- She's not making a big
thing, just leave her alone.

613
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.331
(thunder rumbles)

614
00:32:06.331 --> 00:32:07.490
Oh shit.

615
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.779
Oh shit, Meg.

616
00:32:08.779 --> 00:32:10.125
(Paulie laughs)

617
00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:11.597
Paulie, it's not funny!

618
00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:13.313
- Well, it is a little bit.
- No, it's not!

619
00:32:13.313 --> 00:32:16.593
(Paulie laughs)

620
00:32:16.593 --> 00:32:19.513
(thunder rumbling)

621
00:32:21.805 --> 00:32:23.306
Are you all right?

622
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:27.673
- Will Mom and Dad be okay?

623
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.662
- Yeah.

624
00:32:29.662 --> 00:32:33.175
Yeah, they'll be fine, don't be silly.

625
00:32:36.025 --> 00:32:38.937
Hey, don't be dramatic now, okay?

626
00:32:38.937 --> 00:32:40.191
That's my job, yeah?

627
00:32:41.401 --> 00:32:42.583
Fine.
- Okay.

628
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:43.417
- Fine.

629
00:32:49.477 --> 00:32:52.538
(rain pouring)

630
00:32:52.538 --> 00:32:54.460
- Should we find cover somewhere?

631
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.631
- Where?

632
00:32:55.631 --> 00:32:57.465
Look, we're just under an hour away.

633
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:01.486
- It's pretty bad out there.

634
00:33:01.486 --> 00:33:04.278
I thought they said it was
fine to be out on the roads.

635
00:33:04.278 --> 00:33:06.260
- Well, technically they didn't say that.

636
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.849
They actually said, "You
shouldn't leave your house

637
00:33:08.849 --> 00:33:10.470
"unless it's an emergency,

638
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.685
"and you were coming in from the East."

639
00:33:12.685 --> 00:33:14.547
- Maybe we should turn back.

640
00:33:14.547 --> 00:33:16.267
- Look, it's only supposed to get rough

641
00:33:16.267 --> 00:33:17.163
in a couple more days.

642
00:33:17.163 --> 00:33:18.810
We're almost through this now.

643
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.453
- Watch the road, love!

644
00:33:20.453 --> 00:33:22.370
Pull up, pull off the road!

645
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.756
(tires screeching)

646
00:33:23.756 --> 00:33:26.842
(lightning striking)

647
00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:30.847
- Shit!
- Watch it!

648
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.481
Ah, quick, Bernie!

649
00:33:36.292 --> 00:33:39.377
(lightning striking)

650
00:33:40.513 --> 00:33:41.748
(tires screeching)

651
00:33:41.748 --> 00:33:43.750
- Babe, we burst a tire!

652
00:33:44.598 --> 00:33:45.861
(tires screeching)

653
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:48.896
- Quick, just pull up, pull up!

654
00:33:48.896 --> 00:33:51.816
(thunder rumbling)

655
00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:57.479
We have to move.

656
00:33:57.479 --> 00:33:59.104
Did you see what happened back there?

657
00:33:59.104 --> 00:34:00.875
Christ almighty.

658
00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:03.190
- I think we're by Riley's farm.

659
00:34:04.658 --> 00:34:06.510
The house is a couple of fields over.

660
00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:08.190
- Okay.

661
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:12.152
(suspenseful music continues)

662
00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:15.154
(car doors banging)

663
00:34:16.338 --> 00:34:17.512
- Bloody tire's blown.

664
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.713
- Look, the fields are out in the open.

665
00:34:21.713 --> 00:34:22.824
It's too dangerous.

666
00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.325
- The tele says it's better to be out here

667
00:34:24.325 --> 00:34:26.997
than under one of these trees
or stuck in this tin box.

668
00:34:26.997 --> 00:34:29.270
- Could we not just stay in the car?

669
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.521
- Look out, Di!

670
00:34:31.728 --> 00:34:36.460
(lightning striking)
(explosion blasting)

671
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.404
(suspenseful music continues)

672
00:34:40.404 --> 00:34:41.238
- Oh.

673
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:46.397
(suspenseful music continues)

674
00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:54.213
- Get down.

675
00:34:54.213 --> 00:34:58.049
(suspenseful music continues)

676
00:34:59.949 --> 00:35:02.368
(Di panting)

677
00:35:05.152 --> 00:35:08.071
- What the?
- Jesus Christ, the car.

678
00:35:10.807 --> 00:35:13.118
They shouldn't let anyone
leave their houses.

679
00:35:15.007 --> 00:35:17.529
- Oh my God, there is no signal!

680
00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:18.910
I just want to call the girls.

681
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.955
I can't get a signal.

682
00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:25.221
- Love, there's a house just...

683
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:27.638
If we get to it first,
we can use their phone.

684
00:35:27.638 --> 00:35:30.150
(thunder cracking)

685
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.236
Oh come, come on.

686
00:35:31.236 --> 00:35:33.222
Come on, love, calm down.

687
00:35:33.222 --> 00:35:35.751
It's gonna be all right.

688
00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:38.155
You got me.
- Yeah.

689
00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:39.226
- We're gonna be all right.

690
00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:40.605
- Yeah.

691
00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:42.436
- Come on.
- Okay.

692
00:35:42.436 --> 00:35:45.424
- Look, you've always been there.

693
00:35:45.424 --> 00:35:46.809
I don't know what these things mean.

694
00:35:46.809 --> 00:35:48.549
I forgot my glasses anyway.

695
00:35:48.549 --> 00:35:50.884
(Di laughs)

696
00:35:51.862 --> 00:35:53.030
- Okay, right.

697
00:35:54.297 --> 00:35:57.013
- [Bernie] Let's get to it.

698
00:35:57.013 --> 00:35:57.847
- Quick.

699
00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:01.157
It's okay, I've got the map.

700
00:36:05.241 --> 00:36:06.075
Look.

701
00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.114
Come on, Bernie.

702
00:36:14.317 --> 00:36:17.332
(suspenseful music continues)

703
00:36:17.332 --> 00:36:19.104
Bernie, move!

704
00:36:19.104 --> 00:36:21.195
(lightning striking)

705
00:36:21.195 --> 00:36:24.312
(tree cracking)
(leaves rustling)

706
00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:28.148
(suspenseful music continues)

707
00:36:30.819 --> 00:36:33.989
(lightning crackling)

708
00:36:37.013 --> 00:36:39.650
(suspenseful music continues)

709
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:42.152
(Di whimpers)

710
00:36:44.317 --> 00:36:45.151
No!

711
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:53.274
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

712
00:37:15.661 --> 00:37:20.013
- It seems to have
subsided a little, I think.

713
00:37:20.013 --> 00:37:21.596
- Yeah, maybe it's run it's course.

714
00:37:21.596 --> 00:37:24.266
(radio buzzing)

715
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:27.808
Is there anything on the radio, man?

716
00:37:27.808 --> 00:37:30.360
- Nothing has changed.

717
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.311
Can we just go back in the hot tub now?

718
00:37:33.848 --> 00:37:35.599
- I can still see the clouds above.

719
00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:40.165
Yeah, I can still see some
lightning crackling inside.

720
00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:41.892
- Hope Mom and Dad are okay.

721
00:37:43.631 --> 00:37:46.393
- There's no phone signals,
we're not gonna know anything.

722
00:37:46.393 --> 00:37:49.276
Just stop overthinking it, all right?

723
00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:51.050
- Hey Meg, they'll be fine.

724
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.404
- All right, what do we do?

725
00:37:56.973 --> 00:38:00.835
- Why don't we go back out to the jacuzzi

726
00:38:00.835 --> 00:38:03.357
and chill the hell out?

727
00:38:03.357 --> 00:38:05.399
It's meant to be a party, guys.

728
00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:06.903
Bunch of sad sacks.

729
00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:15.672
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pouring)

730
00:38:19.011 --> 00:38:21.681
(door creaking)

731
00:38:25.071 --> 00:38:27.523
(suspenseful music continues)

732
00:38:27.523 --> 00:38:28.357
- Hello?

733
00:38:30.853 --> 00:38:31.687
Hello?

734
00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:37.272
(door creaking)

735
00:38:37.272 --> 00:38:41.108
(suspenseful music continues)

736
00:38:44.927 --> 00:38:45.761
Hello?

737
00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.099
(thunder rumbling)

738
00:38:54.006 --> 00:38:56.340
(Di groans)

739
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.689
(thunder rumbling)

740
00:39:02.778 --> 00:39:05.551
(suspenseful music continues)

741
00:39:05.551 --> 00:39:07.971
- Darling, stop freaking out.

742
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:09.773
- Okay.
- No, it's fine, I'm here.

743
00:39:09.773 --> 00:39:10.977
- Yeah, thanks.

744
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:19.731
Sorry I don't like give you
what you want sometimes.

745
00:39:20.604 --> 00:39:24.438
It's just, I, like I have
to just take it slow.

746
00:39:24.438 --> 00:39:26.169
- There's no rushing, right?

747
00:39:27.221 --> 00:39:28.823
You know I like you a lot, yeah?

748
00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:34.418
(radio buzzing)

749
00:39:34.418 --> 00:39:37.286
Now we're talking.

750
00:39:37.286 --> 00:39:40.488
- [Radio Host] Reports are
saying this mega lightning storm

751
00:39:40.488 --> 00:39:42.320
is the worst ever recorded.

752
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.202
Vehicles and buildings
have been destroyed.

753
00:39:45.202 --> 00:39:47.854
Old buildings like listed
buildings, cottages

754
00:39:47.854 --> 00:39:51.778
and farmhouses have been more
susceptible to the damage.

755
00:39:51.778 --> 00:39:54.643
One house in Meltonville
was completely destroyed

756
00:39:54.643 --> 00:39:56.333
with lightning causing severe damage

757
00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:58.493
and triggering a house fire.

758
00:39:59.763 --> 00:40:02.009
(phone ringing)
- Oh my God.

759
00:40:02.009 --> 00:40:02.848
It's my Mom.

760
00:40:02.848 --> 00:40:04.248
Mom, Mom?

761
00:40:04.248 --> 00:40:05.916
Mom?
- Meg, I'm fine.

762
00:40:08.938 --> 00:40:09.772
All right?

763
00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:12.418
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

764
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:21.864
I'm at the windmill cottage, Southeast.

765
00:40:21.864 --> 00:40:23.597
- What are you doing there?

766
00:40:25.015 --> 00:40:28.261
- There was an accident, on the road.

767
00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:34.541
- Mom, are you okay?

768
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:38.437
- I'm fine, I'm fine, all right?

769
00:40:38.437 --> 00:40:40.211
I'm still a little shaken.

770
00:40:41.859 --> 00:40:44.171
Look, I'll check back in with you later.

771
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:45.582
Are you girls all right?

772
00:40:45.582 --> 00:40:46.416
- Yeah, we're fine.

773
00:40:46.416 --> 00:40:48.285
Now I'm gonna come, I'm
gonna come and get you.

774
00:40:48.285 --> 00:40:51.306
- No, it's dangerous.

775
00:40:51.306 --> 00:40:53.802
- No, I'm gonna come and
get you and Dad now, okay?

776
00:40:53.802 --> 00:40:55.941
Send me the address.

777
00:40:55.941 --> 00:40:57.592
- Just leave it.

778
00:40:57.592 --> 00:41:01.676
Meg, listen to me for
once in your life, okay?

779
00:41:01.676 --> 00:41:05.713
It is not safe to be out
on the roads, all right?

780
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:08.242
I'll call back on you later.

781
00:41:08.242 --> 00:41:10.019
- I love you.

782
00:41:10.019 --> 00:41:11.227
- Love you too.

783
00:41:13.416 --> 00:41:14.557
(phone beeps)

784
00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:17.349
- Will you take me to
go find my mom and dad?

785
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:18.190
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.522
- They've been in an
accident and we need to go.

787
00:41:20.522 --> 00:41:22.273
- Okay, yeah.
- We need to go now.

788
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.324
(rain pouring)

789
00:41:24.324 --> 00:41:25.157
Corin.
(Corin laughs)

790
00:41:25.157 --> 00:41:26.175
Corin.

791
00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:27.828
Corin, Corin!

792
00:41:27.828 --> 00:41:29.032
- What?
- Listen to me.

793
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.971
Mom and dad have been
in an accident, okay?

794
00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:33.369
- What?

795
00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:37.576
- It's all right, they're fine,
but I need you to stay here.

796
00:41:37.576 --> 00:41:41.039
Be safe and I'm gonna go get Mom, okay?

797
00:41:41.039 --> 00:41:41.872
Just stay there.

798
00:41:43.217 --> 00:41:44.384
- Right, okay.

799
00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:50.089
- I, what do I say?

800
00:41:52.792 --> 00:41:55.271
- Okay, I told her.

801
00:41:55.271 --> 00:41:57.906
Can you get the car ready for me please?

802
00:41:57.906 --> 00:42:00.825
(thunder rumbling)

803
00:42:01.867 --> 00:42:04.286
I don't think we're safe her.

804
00:42:06.266 --> 00:42:07.600
I'll go get her.

805
00:42:11.819 --> 00:42:13.148
- Hope they're okay.

806
00:42:13.148 --> 00:42:17.516
- But in the mean time, we've
got the hot tub to ourselves.

807
00:42:19.707 --> 00:42:21.633
- I don't know, I feel like
I should go check on her.

808
00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:22.563
- Oh, it doesn't matter what's going on

809
00:42:22.563 --> 00:42:23.944
with your weird sister
right now, it's fine.

810
00:42:23.944 --> 00:42:25.206
- Don't call her weird.

811
00:42:25.206 --> 00:42:26.821
- She's causing a lot of drama tonight.

812
00:42:26.821 --> 00:42:28.337
- Yeah, well, she's been through a lot.

813
00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:29.814
You don't know half of it, okay?

814
00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:31.498
- Well, how would I know what's
going on with her, Corin?

815
00:42:31.498 --> 00:42:35.093
(thunder rumbling)

816
00:42:35.093 --> 00:42:36.382
- Paulie, get out.

817
00:42:36.382 --> 00:42:37.480
- It's just the lightning.

818
00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.153
- Paulie, that's getting close.

819
00:42:39.153 --> 00:42:40.892
Paulie, get out now.

820
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:42.906
Paulie, get out of the tub, Paulie!

821
00:42:42.906 --> 00:42:47.910
(lightning crackling)
(suspenseful music)

822
00:42:50.022 --> 00:42:52.691
(Corin screams)

823
00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:58.874
(lightning crackling)
(suspenseful music)

824
00:43:00.488 --> 00:43:04.011
(water splashing)

825
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:06.930
(thunder rumbling)

826
00:43:10.273 --> 00:43:14.109
(suspenseful music continues)

827
00:43:15.618 --> 00:43:16.451
- Hello?

828
00:43:20.202 --> 00:43:23.122
(thunder rumbling)

829
00:43:29.314 --> 00:43:32.598
(steps creaking softly)

830
00:43:32.598 --> 00:43:33.431
Hello?

831
00:43:37.647 --> 00:43:40.566
(thunder cracking)

832
00:43:42.172 --> 00:43:43.376
- Paulie?

833
00:43:43.376 --> 00:43:44.500
(Corin cries)

834
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.648
- Paulie!

835
00:43:45.648 --> 00:43:47.728
- What is it?
- We're gonna die!

836
00:43:47.728 --> 00:43:49.004
We're all gonna die!

837
00:43:49.004 --> 00:43:50.402
- Corin, look at me, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

838
00:43:50.402 --> 00:43:52.282
It's okay, it's okay.
- Paulie!

839
00:43:52.282 --> 00:43:54.165
- No, you need to calm down.

840
00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:55.023
Calm down.

841
00:43:55.023 --> 00:43:56.158
Calm down, look at me.

842
00:43:56.158 --> 00:43:57.168
Calm down.

843
00:43:57.168 --> 00:43:58.454
Calm down, okay?

844
00:43:58.454 --> 00:43:59.884
Okay, it's gonna be all right.

845
00:43:59.884 --> 00:44:03.184
We're gonna make a plan,
we're gonna make a plan.

846
00:44:03.184 --> 00:44:05.599
(Corin whimpers)

847
00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.675
It's okay, it's okay.

848
00:44:07.675 --> 00:44:09.008
- [Sean] Go, go, go!

849
00:44:09.008 --> 00:44:09.926
Go, go, go!

850
00:44:11.469 --> 00:44:13.365
(suspenseful music continues)

851
00:44:13.365 --> 00:44:18.369
(thunder cracking)
(lightning striking)

852
00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:22.611
- Oh my God.

853
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:24.645
- Right, this place is
gonna cave any second.

854
00:44:24.645 --> 00:44:27.282
(Corin whimpering)
(thunder rumbling)

855
00:44:27.282 --> 00:44:30.202
(ceiling cracking)

856
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.207
- Okay.

857
00:44:32.207 --> 00:44:33.843
We gotta go.
- Yeah, yeah.

858
00:44:33.843 --> 00:44:34.937
- We gotta go.

859
00:44:34.937 --> 00:44:36.188
- Go.
- Come on.

860
00:44:37.077 --> 00:44:38.228
(suspenseful music)

861
00:44:38.228 --> 00:44:39.237
Come on, this way.

862
00:44:39.237 --> 00:44:41.156
(thunder cracking)

863
00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:42.123
- Wait.
- What?

864
00:44:42.123 --> 00:44:45.196
- I've noticed usually
before the ground strikes,

865
00:44:45.196 --> 00:44:46.881
which comes in flurries,

866
00:44:46.881 --> 00:44:49.926
there's some kind of
like build up lightning,

867
00:44:49.926 --> 00:44:51.247
all right, in the clouds.

868
00:44:51.247 --> 00:44:53.224
And it seems to build up
before it hits the ground.

869
00:44:53.224 --> 00:44:54.710
- Right, and you think
we've got a warning?

870
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:55.761
(thunder cracking)

871
00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:59.116
- So that's like the last
surge has passed or something.

872
00:44:59.116 --> 00:45:00.975
- Well, literally it's clear over there.

873
00:45:00.975 --> 00:45:02.507
There's nothing in in
the clouds, let's go.

874
00:45:02.507 --> 00:45:03.948
- Oh, so we should go that way then.

875
00:45:03.948 --> 00:45:05.708
- Yeah, yeah, we're gonna
get your parents first.

876
00:45:05.708 --> 00:45:08.468
And then once we got
them, we get the fuck out

877
00:45:08.468 --> 00:45:09.778
of this danger zone, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

878
00:45:09.778 --> 00:45:11.823
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

879
00:45:11.823 --> 00:45:14.682
(suspenseful music continues)

880
00:45:14.682 --> 00:45:16.148
- He's dead!

881
00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:18.286
He's dead, we've gotta get inside!

882
00:45:18.286 --> 00:45:19.531
- Sally!
- Sally, come here!

883
00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:20.824
- Get in the car!
- Sally, get in the car now!

884
00:45:20.824 --> 00:45:21.932
- Sally, get in the car!
- Sally!

885
00:45:21.932 --> 00:45:23.145
- Sally, come over here!

886
00:45:23.145 --> 00:45:25.755
Come over here!
(thunder cracking)

887
00:45:25.755 --> 00:45:28.674
(sparks crackling)

888
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:30.693
(Corin screaming)

889
00:45:30.693 --> 00:45:32.977
- Sally, no!
- Sally!

890
00:45:32.977 --> 00:45:35.729
- We've gotta go, we've gotta go!

891
00:45:36.925 --> 00:45:37.759
- Sally.

892
00:45:39.848 --> 00:45:42.767
(thunder cracking)

893
00:45:45.089 --> 00:45:50.093
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

894
00:45:57.645 --> 00:46:00.564
(thunder cracking)

895
00:46:07.908 --> 00:46:09.571
- Any luck yet?

896
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:12.498
- No, I can't get any signal.

897
00:46:12.498 --> 00:46:15.040
I'll try, no, I'll call the police after.

898
00:46:16.262 --> 00:46:17.876
It's just not working.

899
00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:22.881
- Oh my God, Sally! (cries)

900
00:46:22.964 --> 00:46:25.549
How can this be happening, Meg?

901
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:28.435
- Paulie, was he...

902
00:46:29.302 --> 00:46:31.693
Paulie, was he definitely dead?

903
00:46:31.693 --> 00:46:34.195
(Corin cries)

904
00:46:37.314 --> 00:46:38.820
- Can you call his parents?

905
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.654
Can you call his parents?

906
00:46:39.654 --> 00:46:41.589
After you call the police,
can you call his parents?

907
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:43.115
They need to know!
- Okay.

908
00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:44.316
- No, they need to know!

909
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:50.005
- Okay.

910
00:46:50.914 --> 00:46:53.833
(thunder rumbling)

911
00:46:54.746 --> 00:46:56.719
I can drive if you want me to.

912
00:46:56.719 --> 00:46:59.916
- No, no, I'm clear, I'm good.

913
00:46:59.916 --> 00:47:00.750
I'm good.

914
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.168
(thunder rumbling)

915
00:47:04.168 --> 00:47:06.090
You know we're driving right
into the eye of this storm.

916
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.852
- Yeah, I know, but we just
need to go and get my parents

917
00:47:07.852 --> 00:47:09.515
and just pick them up and then
we can get out of here, okay?

918
00:47:09.515 --> 00:47:10.837
Just focus on that.

919
00:47:12.417 --> 00:47:14.136
(thunder rumbling)

920
00:47:14.136 --> 00:47:16.809
- The storm's gotta be at
like 10 miles at least.

921
00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:18.338
I reckon we just, we just get them both,

922
00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:21.135
and we just get out the danger zone, okay?

923
00:47:22.243 --> 00:47:23.077
Yeah?

924
00:47:24.345 --> 00:47:26.867
- I heard reports last week,
and they said the lightning

925
00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:28.318
was knocking out electronics.

926
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:32.815
Depending on the proximity,
it's working like an EMP.

927
00:47:36.025 --> 00:47:37.125
This is bullshit, man.

928
00:47:39.165 --> 00:47:42.225
(thunder rumbling)

929
00:47:42.225 --> 00:47:44.702
(prisoner groans)

930
00:47:44.702 --> 00:47:45.535
- Please help me.

931
00:47:45.535 --> 00:47:47.314
Can you please get me out of here?

932
00:47:47.314 --> 00:47:48.148
Okay.

933
00:47:50.872 --> 00:47:55.541
(suspenseful music)
(thunder cracking)

934
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:57.015
- By Providence Divine,

935
00:47:57.973 --> 00:48:00.525
how on earth did you wind up in here?

936
00:48:00.525 --> 00:48:02.359
- Please, don't.

937
00:48:03.557 --> 00:48:05.689
- I should be pinched to death.

938
00:48:05.689 --> 00:48:07.100
- Put away the knife.

939
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.902
- I have to be careful.

940
00:48:08.902 --> 00:48:11.544
I've already been attacked
by one intruder tonight.

941
00:48:11.544 --> 00:48:13.827
- He's lying, you're lying!

942
00:48:13.827 --> 00:48:18.360
(suspenseful music continues)

943
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.936
- The lightning, we
have to get out of here.

944
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.716
- Do you not want to
be struck by lightning?

945
00:48:25.716 --> 00:48:28.571
- My husband died in this tonight.

946
00:48:29.979 --> 00:48:33.552
- You really don't need to
worry about lightning anymore.

947
00:48:33.552 --> 00:48:34.924
- What, why?

948
00:48:34.924 --> 00:48:37.696
- I mean, you were trespassing.

949
00:48:37.696 --> 00:48:39.801
It was self-defense.

950
00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:42.560
(suspenseful music continues)

951
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.630
- Run, get out of here, get out of here!

952
00:48:46.867 --> 00:48:48.775
- How didst thou escape?

953
00:48:48.775 --> 00:48:51.759
(thunder rumbling)

954
00:48:51.759 --> 00:48:55.595
(suspenseful music continues)

955
00:48:59.113 --> 00:49:02.032
(thunder cracking)

956
00:49:11.966 --> 00:49:14.647
I do smell of horse kiss.

957
00:49:20.264 --> 00:49:23.184
(thunder rumbling)

958
00:49:27.786 --> 00:49:32.790
(door creaking)
(thunder cracking)

959
00:49:38.497 --> 00:49:42.493
(suspenseful music continues)

960
00:49:42.493 --> 00:49:43.827
Oh, woe the day.

961
00:49:45.113 --> 00:49:48.471
(thunder cracking)

962
00:49:48.471 --> 00:49:53.475
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

963
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.760
(prisoner panting)

964
00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:22.337
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

965
00:50:45.755 --> 00:50:46.743
(kidnapper grunts)
(prisoner groans)

966
00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.505
(kidnapper laughs)

967
00:50:48.505 --> 00:50:51.424
(kidnapper groans)

968
00:50:53.711 --> 00:50:55.099
(suspenseful music continues)

969
00:50:55.099 --> 00:50:55.933
Oh.

970
00:51:06.388 --> 00:51:07.927
- It's so weird.

971
00:51:07.927 --> 00:51:10.429
Like no one being on the road.

972
00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:14.828
- How did this happen?

973
00:51:14.828 --> 00:51:16.997
I mean, what's causing it?

974
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.282
- Mother Nature fighting back.

975
00:51:21.282 --> 00:51:26.286
- Yeah, Dad mentioned this
story yesterday in the paper.

976
00:51:29.259 --> 00:51:30.210
- What's the story?

977
00:51:31.936 --> 00:51:35.414
- It was a theory about one of the storms,

978
00:51:35.414 --> 00:51:40.118
that the lightning tunes to the current

979
00:51:40.118 --> 00:51:41.669
of the human body or something.

980
00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:45.409
- That sounds impossible.

981
00:51:45.409 --> 00:51:47.034
- Yeah, people have been struck

982
00:51:47.034 --> 00:51:49.889
by lightning a lot more
recently, haven't they?

983
00:51:51.626 --> 00:51:53.627
- I mean, it's the second storm in days.

984
00:51:56.552 --> 00:51:57.686
What if this is our time?

985
00:51:58.984 --> 00:52:00.305
- It just felt a lot worse than what we've

986
00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:02.019
been experiencing until now.

987
00:52:03.251 --> 00:52:04.085
- I hope not.

988
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:07.007
- Sorry about Paulie.

989
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.601
- I should have got him out of there.

990
00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:16.368
Should have got him out of there.

991
00:52:16.368 --> 00:52:19.345
I should not, I should
have got him out of there.

992
00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:20.722
- [Corin] Sean.

993
00:52:20.722 --> 00:52:23.334
It was a freak of nature, all right?

994
00:52:23.334 --> 00:52:25.382
- No, I should, I should
have got him out of there!

995
00:52:25.382 --> 00:52:28.481
I should have got him out of there!

996
00:52:28.481 --> 00:52:29.480
(thunder rumbling)

997
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.814
- Paulie's dead!

998
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.936
(Corin cries softly)

999
00:52:36.633 --> 00:52:38.685
I don't think it's safe to drive anymore.

1000
00:52:39.643 --> 00:52:41.806
We should...

1001
00:52:41.806 --> 00:52:45.445
We should head out on
foot on the backfields.

1002
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.254
- Okay.

1003
00:52:54.612 --> 00:52:59.616
(suspenseful music)
(thunder cracking)

1004
00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:07.701
(prisoner panting)

1005
00:53:10.574 --> 00:53:13.577
(prisoner groaning)

1006
00:53:16.362 --> 00:53:21.366
(thunder rumbling)
(prisoner panting)

1007
00:53:22.835 --> 00:53:27.267
(kidnapper imitating animal hooting)

1008
00:53:27.267 --> 00:53:30.353
(kidnapper laughing)

1009
00:53:34.556 --> 00:53:38.089
(thunder rumbling)

1010
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:39.204
(suspenseful music continues)

1011
00:53:39.204 --> 00:53:43.078
(kidnapper imitating animal hooting)

1012
00:53:43.078 --> 00:53:46.942
(kidnapper laughing)

1013
00:53:46.942 --> 00:53:51.946
(prisoner grunting)
(kidnapper groaning)

1014
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.177
(footsteps thudding)

1015
00:53:57.177 --> 00:54:02.181
- Damn!
(hand thudding)

1016
00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:09.112
(thunder rumbling)
(prisoner groaning)

1017
00:54:11.638 --> 00:54:14.558
(prisoner panting)

1018
00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:26.295
(footsteps thudding)
(thunder cracking)

1019
00:54:31.928 --> 00:54:32.762
- Alas.

1020
00:54:34.042 --> 00:54:36.127
The storm has come again.

1021
00:54:42.507 --> 00:54:44.725
These are not natural events.

1022
00:54:45.653 --> 00:54:48.598
They strengthen from strange to stranger.

1023
00:54:51.084 --> 00:54:56.088
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

1024
00:55:02.346 --> 00:55:03.761
All lost to prayers.

1025
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.293
To prayers all lost.

1026
00:55:08.293 --> 00:55:11.379
(lightning striking)

1027
00:55:21.765 --> 00:55:26.769
And so the elements we free! (laughs)

1028
00:55:30.222 --> 00:55:35.226
(footsteps thudding)
(thunder rumbling)

1029
00:55:38.955 --> 00:55:41.540
Let them all be hunted soundly.

1030
00:55:43.564 --> 00:55:46.483
(thunder rumbling)

1031
00:55:50.258 --> 00:55:53.428
(lightning crackling)

1032
00:55:54.287 --> 00:55:57.206
(thunder cracking)

1033
00:56:03.534 --> 00:56:06.204
(Corin panting)

1034
00:56:08.303 --> 00:56:09.154
- No.

1035
00:56:09.154 --> 00:56:10.996
It's the birds I think.

1036
00:56:10.996 --> 00:56:13.915
(thunder rumbling)

1037
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:23.674
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1038
00:56:25.628 --> 00:56:26.652
(Corin cries)

1039
00:56:26.652 --> 00:56:27.581
No.

1040
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:30.276
- What is it?
- Meg, just don't look, okay?

1041
00:56:30.276 --> 00:56:32.557
- What is it, who is it?
- Just stay over there, okay?

1042
00:56:32.557 --> 00:56:34.058
- What is it?
- No!

1043
00:56:35.876 --> 00:56:39.713
(suspenseful music continues)

1044
00:56:42.015 --> 00:56:42.848
He's dead!

1045
00:56:43.693 --> 00:56:47.190
(sisters crying)

1046
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.710
- No.

1047
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:50.368
Mom.

1048
00:56:50.368 --> 00:56:51.202
Mom?

1049
00:56:51.202 --> 00:56:52.329
Mom!

1050
00:56:52.329 --> 00:56:56.704
Mom, Mom! (cries)

1051
00:56:56.704 --> 00:56:57.788
- Oh no, Dad.

1052
00:56:59.405 --> 00:57:01.003
- Mom!

1053
00:57:01.003 --> 00:57:04.924
Mom! (cries)

1054
00:57:06.693 --> 00:57:07.527
Mom!

1055
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:09.904
No.
- Meg, Meg.

1056
00:57:09.904 --> 00:57:12.140
- I need to find my mom.
- Meg!

1057
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.141
- I need to find my mom.

1058
00:57:16.198 --> 00:57:17.369
She said...

1059
00:57:17.369 --> 00:57:19.621
She said she was in a
house and they left her.

1060
00:57:19.621 --> 00:57:22.106
She mustn't go out there,
she mustn't go out there.

1061
00:57:22.106 --> 00:57:23.527
Something must have happened to her!

1062
00:57:23.527 --> 00:57:24.361
- I know, I know.

1063
00:57:24.361 --> 00:57:25.697
You said it sounded weird.

1064
00:57:25.697 --> 00:57:26.977
But we just need to find the house

1065
00:57:26.977 --> 00:57:28.865
and she might be in there.

1066
00:57:28.865 --> 00:57:33.535
- Yeah, okay. (cries)

1067
00:57:38.825 --> 00:57:41.744
(thunder cracking)

1068
00:57:42.609 --> 00:57:46.195
(lightning striking)
- Meg!

1069
00:57:49.983 --> 00:57:50.817
- Meg?

1070
00:57:54.651 --> 00:57:56.283
Sean!

1071
00:57:56.283 --> 00:57:58.982
(thunder cracking)

1072
00:57:58.982 --> 00:58:03.986
Where are you? (whimpers)

1073
00:58:08.533 --> 00:58:12.786
- You know you are not
going to get away with this.

1074
00:58:13.944 --> 00:58:15.445
- Oh, the heavens.

1075
00:58:16.937 --> 00:58:20.773
(suspenseful music continues)

1076
00:58:26.913 --> 00:58:28.322
(Di groans)

1077
00:58:28.322 --> 00:58:30.824
That's what all the girls say.

1078
00:58:33.474 --> 00:58:35.809
(Di groans)

1079
00:58:40.078 --> 00:58:42.997
(thunder cracking)

1080
00:58:45.518 --> 00:58:48.604
(footsteps thudding)

1081
00:58:50.219 --> 00:58:55.224
(thunder cracking)
(suspenseful music)

1082
00:59:04.036 --> 00:59:05.611
(footsteps thudding)

1083
00:59:05.611 --> 00:59:06.529
- Meg, Meg?

1084
00:59:07.847 --> 00:59:09.515
Meg, oh my God, Meg.

1085
00:59:10.657 --> 00:59:11.741
Are you okay?

1086
00:59:12.597 --> 00:59:13.431
- Sean?

1087
00:59:14.458 --> 00:59:16.143
Where's Sean?

1088
00:59:16.143 --> 00:59:18.061
Where's Sean?

1089
00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:18.894
Sean?

1090
00:59:20.074 --> 00:59:21.944
- He didn't make it.

1091
00:59:21.944 --> 00:59:23.541
- Sean?

1092
00:59:23.541 --> 00:59:24.375
Sean!

1093
00:59:26.431 --> 00:59:27.264
Sean.

1094
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.164
Sean!

1095
00:59:31.162 --> 00:59:33.804
Sean! (cries)

1096
00:59:33.804 --> 00:59:37.655
Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean.

1097
00:59:37.655 --> 00:59:39.122
Sean, no!

1098
00:59:39.122 --> 00:59:42.042
(thunder cracking)

1099
00:59:45.079 --> 00:59:45.913
No.

1100
00:59:48.878 --> 00:59:51.547
No, I can't see him!
- I'm sorry.

1101
00:59:54.606 --> 00:59:59.552
- I can't do this anymore. (cries)

1102
00:59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.554
I can't do this anymore!

1103
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.174
I can't, please!

1104
01:00:05.456 --> 01:00:06.888
- It's okay, come here.

1105
01:00:06.888 --> 01:00:09.923
- I can't do this anymore, I can't!

1106
01:00:09.923 --> 01:00:14.927
No, I can't. (cries)

1107
01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:19.955
(sisters crying)
(thunder rumbling)

1108
01:00:19.955 --> 01:00:20.956
- It's okay.

1109
01:00:24.656 --> 01:00:27.779
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

1110
01:00:27.779 --> 01:00:29.998
(thunder rumbling)

1111
01:00:29.998 --> 01:00:30.832
- Meg.

1112
01:00:32.218 --> 01:00:33.330
Meg.

1113
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:34.226
- What?

1114
01:00:34.226 --> 01:00:37.456
- We need, we need to go find the house.

1115
01:00:37.456 --> 01:00:39.250
We need to go find Mom, okay?

1116
01:00:40.809 --> 01:00:42.891
We're gonna go, we're gonna get Mom.

1117
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:43.925
- Okay.

1118
01:00:43.925 --> 01:00:47.904
- And I need you, I need
you to be strong, okay?

1119
01:00:47.904 --> 01:00:49.859
I need you with me, okay?

1120
01:00:49.859 --> 01:00:51.027
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1121
01:00:52.193 --> 01:00:53.562
Okay, let's go.

1122
01:00:54.969 --> 01:00:55.970
Yeah?
- Okay.

1123
01:00:58.845 --> 01:01:01.764
(sisters grunting)

1124
01:01:02.734 --> 01:01:05.344
- That's it, that's it.

1125
01:01:05.344 --> 01:01:07.989
(thunder rumbling)
(suspenseful music continues)

1126
01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:09.713
Okay, look.

1127
01:01:09.713 --> 01:01:12.645
That could be the house
that Mom was talking about.

1128
01:01:12.645 --> 01:01:13.996
Yeah?

1129
01:01:13.996 --> 01:01:15.958
That could be where Mom is.

1130
01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:18.075
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

1131
01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:21.296
(twigs cracking)

1132
01:01:21.296 --> 01:01:22.547
Come on.
- Yeah.

1133
01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:28.566
- Okay. (panting)

1134
01:01:28.566 --> 01:01:29.400
- No.

1135
01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.281
- Hello?

1136
01:01:32.281 --> 01:01:33.115
We need help.

1137
01:01:33.115 --> 01:01:34.489
- No, no one's in.

1138
01:01:34.489 --> 01:01:35.916
(hand knocking)

1139
01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:38.919
(muffled screaming)

1140
01:01:39.795 --> 01:01:40.961
No one's in.

1141
01:01:40.961 --> 01:01:43.071
- We need to find the door.
- They could be gone.

1142
01:01:43.071 --> 01:01:46.074
(muffled screaming)

1143
01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:50.951
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

1144
01:01:50.951 --> 01:01:53.786
(shovel thudding)

1145
01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:59.787
- She who dies pays all debts.

1146
01:02:05.857 --> 01:02:08.777
(thunder cracking)

1147
01:02:13.249 --> 01:02:16.792
(shovel thumping)

1148
01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:21.797
(kidnapper laughing)
(thunder rumbling)

1149
01:02:24.015 --> 01:02:26.146
- [Meg] We can't!

1150
01:02:26.146 --> 01:02:27.587
- Look, we need shelter.

1151
01:02:27.587 --> 01:02:29.061
And you need to be more warm.

1152
01:02:29.061 --> 01:02:30.308
- Okay.
- All right?

1153
01:02:30.308 --> 01:02:31.343
- Why don't you try again?

1154
01:02:31.343 --> 01:02:33.511
Try the door.
- Okay, okay.

1155
01:02:35.658 --> 01:02:37.993
- [Meg] Wait, there's a car.

1156
01:02:38.884 --> 01:02:41.356
- All right, well if someone
comes back while we're

1157
01:02:41.356 --> 01:02:42.840
in there then we'll just explain.

1158
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.711
- Okay.
- All right?

1159
01:02:43.711 --> 01:02:45.262
- Just go, just go.
- Come on.

1160
01:02:49.489 --> 01:02:52.158
(door creaking)

1161
01:02:54.383 --> 01:02:55.217
- Hello?

1162
01:02:56.402 --> 01:03:00.238
(suspenseful music continues)

1163
01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.150
Hello?

1164
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:11.070
(muffled shouting)

1165
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:14.809
(Di panting)

1166
01:03:18.648 --> 01:03:21.651
(muffled screaming)

1167
01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.606
- We're looking for
shelter from the storm.

1168
01:03:29.693 --> 01:03:32.510
(switch clicking)

1169
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:33.343
No power.

1170
01:03:37.732 --> 01:03:38.650
- Let's go.

1171
01:03:45.629 --> 01:03:48.631
(muffled screaming)

1172
01:03:50.798 --> 01:03:52.693
What are you doing?

1173
01:03:52.693 --> 01:03:54.995
- [Corin] Finding something
to do you up with.

1174
01:04:03.237 --> 01:04:07.073
(suspenseful music continues)

1175
01:04:09.905 --> 01:04:12.403
(zipper clattering)

1176
01:04:12.403 --> 01:04:14.065
Okay, here we go.

1177
01:04:14.065 --> 01:04:14.899
Sorry.

1178
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:19.158
That's a bit better.

1179
01:04:20.138 --> 01:04:23.096
- Okay.
- Hey, it's magic healing.

1180
01:04:23.096 --> 01:04:26.276
(both chuckling)

1181
01:04:26.276 --> 01:04:27.661
- Yeah, when I was younger,

1182
01:04:29.729 --> 01:04:33.633
the wounds always seemed
to heal like faster,

1183
01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.511
you know, when Dad kissed them.

1184
01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:43.848
And then when I got older and he stopped,

1185
01:04:45.913 --> 01:04:50.917
like they just seemed to
hurt a bit more, do you know?

1186
01:04:52.475 --> 01:04:53.309
- Yeah.

1187
01:04:55.348 --> 01:04:56.181
Hey.

1188
01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.007
I don't know how we do this.

1189
01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:06.538
- The storm?

1190
01:05:06.538 --> 01:05:09.040
- No, I mean, after the storm.

1191
01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:13.100
I don't think I can.

1192
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.280
- You can.
- I mean

1193
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.339
like when the dust settles and...

1194
01:05:18.428 --> 01:05:20.565
I just think it's gonna be even harder.

1195
01:05:23.234 --> 01:05:25.509
The reality of what's happened and...

1196
01:05:28.949 --> 01:05:30.450
How do we do this?

1197
01:05:32.282 --> 01:05:33.200
- Together.

1198
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:36.215
Come here.

1199
01:05:40.205 --> 01:05:41.123
- Love you.

1200
01:05:43.783 --> 01:05:48.787
(bed creaking)
(Di panting)

1201
01:05:50.236 --> 01:05:53.489
(bowl clanging loudly)

1202
01:05:56.295 --> 01:05:57.129
Shit.

1203
01:06:00.205 --> 01:06:01.706
- Something's off.

1204
01:06:02.941 --> 01:06:04.164
- I don't know.

1205
01:06:04.164 --> 01:06:07.047
(thunder rumbling)

1206
01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:10.050
(muffled screaming)

1207
01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:14.054
What the fuck?

1208
01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:18.523
(mouth spitting)

1209
01:06:18.523 --> 01:06:20.942
(Di panting)

1210
01:06:32.691 --> 01:06:35.193
(Di groaning)

1211
01:06:38.857 --> 01:06:41.276
(Di panting)

1212
01:06:51.471 --> 01:06:52.305
Hello?

1213
01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:57.414
(Corin panting)

1214
01:07:03.256 --> 01:07:04.590
Is anyone there?

1215
01:07:07.602 --> 01:07:09.505
- What do you think's happening?

1216
01:07:09.505 --> 01:07:13.551
That he's like hurt or is
it like someone dangerous

1217
01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:14.690
or something, I don't know.

1218
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.124
What should we do?

1219
01:07:16.124 --> 01:07:17.865
- I bet it's locked.

1220
01:07:17.865 --> 01:07:19.881
Should we go in?

1221
01:07:19.881 --> 01:07:21.633
- I think we should go in.
- Yeah.

1222
01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:24.772
- Jesus, Corin.
- What?

1223
01:07:24.772 --> 01:07:25.806
- What?

1224
01:07:25.806 --> 01:07:27.647
- I need to open it.

1225
01:07:27.647 --> 01:07:29.044
Yeah?
- Yeah, okay.

1226
01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:29.923
Go, go, go, go.

1227
01:07:29.923 --> 01:07:32.676
Go, just go.
- All right, come on.

1228
01:07:35.798 --> 01:07:37.300
- Yeah, go.
- Okay.

1229
01:07:39.772 --> 01:07:43.196
(mallet bangs)
(lock thuds)

1230
01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:44.279
- [Meg] Okay, go.

1231
01:07:44.279 --> 01:07:45.447
- Mom?
- Girls!

1232
01:07:46.756 --> 01:07:50.438
Just fucking help me!
- Oh my God, Mom!

1233
01:07:50.438 --> 01:07:52.022
- Girls.
- Mom, Mom.

1234
01:07:53.197 --> 01:07:54.980
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.

1235
01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.415
- We need to get out
of here really quickly.

1236
01:07:58.463 --> 01:08:01.976
The guy who owns this
place is fucking crazy.

1237
01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:03.030
He kidnapped me.

1238
01:08:04.452 --> 01:08:06.937
If he finds you here, he'll kill us all.

1239
01:08:09.399 --> 01:08:11.524
- How long's he been gone?

1240
01:08:11.524 --> 01:08:13.677
- Oh, I've got no idea.

1241
01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:15.007
I heard him head out.

1242
01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:16.358
I don't know where he is.

1243
01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.342
- All right, well.
- Quick!

1244
01:08:18.342 --> 01:08:19.360
- It's okay.

1245
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.432
People have been dying left and right.

1246
01:08:21.432 --> 01:08:23.414
If he's out there, he
might have been struck.

1247
01:08:23.414 --> 01:08:24.285
- Oh, I hope so.

1248
01:08:24.285 --> 01:08:26.116
I want that bastard to die!

1249
01:08:26.116 --> 01:08:26.950
- Yeah, we need to go.

1250
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:27.960
Please, just go.

1251
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.793
- I saw a knife.

1252
01:08:28.793 --> 01:08:29.909
I'm gonna go and grab it, okay?

1253
01:08:29.909 --> 01:08:31.655
I'll be back.

1254
01:08:31.655 --> 01:08:33.172
- What happened?

1255
01:08:33.172 --> 01:08:36.358
- There was another woman here before me.

1256
01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:43.333
(thunder rumbling)

1257
01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:54.654
(suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

1258
01:09:07.635 --> 01:09:10.585
(door creaking)

1259
01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:14.253
(door bangs softly)

1260
01:09:14.253 --> 01:09:18.090
(suspenseful music continues)

1261
01:09:24.947 --> 01:09:28.783
Then he said he was gonna
replace her with me.

1262
01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:31.511
He grabbed me from behind.

1263
01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:34.814
He put something over my
face, he knocked me out.

1264
01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:36.465
And then I woke up tied up in this room!

1265
01:09:36.465 --> 01:09:39.856
- Mom.
- Thank God you came!

1266
01:09:39.856 --> 01:09:44.475
Oh God. (cries)

1267
01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:46.140
- It's okay, Mom.

1268
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:46.974
It's okay.

1269
01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:51.109
- After you, I know.

1270
01:09:53.429 --> 01:09:56.522
He showed me some vile
and horrible pictures.

1271
01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:58.166
- Of what?

1272
01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:01.038
- Other girls, here before me.

1273
01:10:01.038 --> 01:10:05.622
I recognized a couple
from posters around town.

1274
01:10:08.351 --> 01:10:09.482
After your father...

1275
01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:11.807
I...

1276
01:10:15.017 --> 01:10:16.018
- We found his body.

1277
01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:19.254
- I should have told you.

1278
01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:22.496
I'm so sorry, Meg.

1279
01:10:22.496 --> 01:10:23.497
- It's okay.

1280
01:10:24.368 --> 01:10:26.369
- I just wanted to keep you safe.

1281
01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:31.151
What happened with your
father was just all so sudden.

1282
01:10:31.151 --> 01:10:34.154
(footsteps tapping)

1283
01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:42.613
- He's here, quick, come on.

1284
01:10:43.855 --> 01:10:45.142
- Please, come on quick, help me.

1285
01:10:45.142 --> 01:10:46.906
- Let's go.
- Come on, Mom, Mom, Mom.

1286
01:10:46.906 --> 01:10:48.456
Just come with me.

1287
01:10:48.456 --> 01:10:52.292
(suspenseful music continues)

1288
01:11:05.515 --> 01:11:06.683
- Shit.
- What?

1289
01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:10.571
- I forgot my phone downstairs.

1290
01:11:10.571 --> 01:11:14.408
(suspenseful music continues)

1291
01:11:16.061 --> 01:11:17.709
- Mom, what are you doing?

1292
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:19.601
- I'll deal with him.
- No!

1293
01:11:19.601 --> 01:11:20.982
- He doesn't know who you are.

1294
01:11:20.982 --> 01:11:24.541
You need to get out now, both of you.

1295
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:26.543
- No, I think we should all go together.

1296
01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:30.753
- We have to get through
him first, okay, yeah?

1297
01:11:31.738 --> 01:11:32.572
- Oh!

1298
01:11:34.338 --> 01:11:36.007
- Oh no, what do we?

1299
01:11:37.257 --> 01:11:38.425
What do we do?

1300
01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.987
Let's hide, let's hide.

1301
01:11:41.987 --> 01:11:46.992
(suspenseful music continues)
(stairs creaking)

1302
01:11:58.049 --> 01:11:59.614
(thunder rumbling)

1303
01:11:59.614 --> 01:12:02.620
(lock rattles)

1304
01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.289
(latch rattles)

1305
01:12:10.597 --> 01:12:11.431
Okay.

1306
01:12:12.921 --> 01:12:16.757
(suspenseful music continues)

1307
01:12:22.633 --> 01:12:24.787
(Di grunts)
(kidnapper groans)

1308
01:12:24.787 --> 01:12:25.705
- [Di] Run!

1309
01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:32.222
(kidnapper coughs)

1310
01:12:33.581 --> 01:12:36.765
(footsteps thudding)

1311
01:12:36.765 --> 01:12:37.879
- Wait!

1312
01:12:37.879 --> 01:12:39.865
We can't just leave her,
we can't just leave her.

1313
01:12:39.865 --> 01:12:40.698
- Oh fuck!

1314
01:12:42.687 --> 01:12:45.844
- Okay, wait, just stop, stop.

1315
01:12:45.844 --> 01:12:47.694
We need to come right back.

1316
01:12:47.694 --> 01:12:51.558
We need to find some way
to protect ourselves, okay?

1317
01:12:51.558 --> 01:12:52.984
- Meg, Meg.

1318
01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:54.152
- What?
- Look.

1319
01:12:54.987 --> 01:12:57.609
The storm, it's coming back this way.

1320
01:12:57.609 --> 01:12:58.536
Oh shit.

1321
01:12:59.669 --> 01:13:01.098
(thunder cracking)

1322
01:13:01.098 --> 01:13:04.306
(both gasping)

1323
01:13:04.306 --> 01:13:07.792
- What do we do?

1324
01:13:07.792 --> 01:13:10.473
(Di grunts)

1325
01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:15.462
- Hostile spirit. (grunts)

1326
01:13:15.462 --> 01:13:18.048
(mallet bangs)

1327
01:13:19.227 --> 01:13:23.630
(kidnapper grunts)
(Di groans)

1328
01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:25.548
(head butts)

1329
01:13:25.548 --> 01:13:29.721
(suspenseful music continues)

1330
01:13:29.721 --> 01:13:32.549
(footsteps thudding)

1331
01:13:32.549 --> 01:13:34.720
It won't be so quick and painless for you.

1332
01:13:35.968 --> 01:13:39.179
I shall flay each of you in turn.

1333
01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:41.832
(both panting)

1334
01:13:41.832 --> 01:13:43.083
- Oh fuck.
- Go!

1335
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:49.587
Quick, down here.

1336
01:13:53.559 --> 01:13:58.563
(suspenseful music continues)
(kidnapper whistles)

1337
01:14:04.335 --> 01:14:08.753
- If I knew I'd have
guests, I'd have cleaned.

1338
01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:11.088
The spirit torments me, ugh!

1339
01:14:12.472 --> 01:14:16.688
(suspenseful music continues)

1340
01:14:16.688 --> 01:14:18.319
(floor creaking)

1341
01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:21.290
(footsteps thudding)

1342
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.376
(kidnapper whistles)

1343
01:14:35.154 --> 01:14:38.099
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

1344
01:14:41.989 --> 01:14:43.170
The hour has come.

1345
01:14:45.963 --> 01:14:47.917
You know what I'm going to enjoy?

1346
01:14:50.584 --> 01:14:54.160
Making you choose who dies first

1347
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.354
and who gets to watch the suffering.

1348
01:14:57.823 --> 01:15:00.318
The god of thunder calls to me once again.

1349
01:15:03.648 --> 01:15:05.452
Perhaps he wants a sacrifice.

1350
01:15:06.409 --> 01:15:10.245
(suspenseful music continues)

1351
01:15:21.753 --> 01:15:22.656
It's not enough.

1352
01:15:24.725 --> 01:15:26.028
I'm going to need more blood!

1353
01:15:26.028 --> 01:15:28.298
(Corin screams)

1354
01:15:28.298 --> 01:15:29.804
- Go, go!

1355
01:15:29.804 --> 01:15:33.641
(suspenseful music continues)

1356
01:15:35.924 --> 01:15:37.396
Stay back.

1357
01:15:37.396 --> 01:15:38.229
- No.

1358
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.489
(knife rattles)
- Ow.

1359
01:15:41.489 --> 01:15:46.493
(kidnapper chuckles)
(Corine groans)

1360
01:15:46.536 --> 01:15:47.866
(lips smacking)

1361
01:15:47.866 --> 01:15:49.473
(kidnapper chuckling)
(head butting)

1362
01:15:49.473 --> 01:15:52.225
(Corin groaning)

1363
01:15:53.072 --> 01:15:54.298
(kidnapper grunts)

1364
01:15:54.298 --> 01:15:56.286
(Meg grunts)
(shovel smacks)

1365
01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:57.596
(kidnapper groans)

1366
01:15:57.596 --> 01:15:59.577
(kidnapper mutters)

1367
01:15:59.577 --> 01:16:01.636
- Hag's here, hence!

1368
01:16:01.636 --> 01:16:02.880
(shovel thuds)

1369
01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.299
(Meg groans)

1370
01:16:09.072 --> 01:16:13.336
You're feisty, I like that! (chuckles)

1371
01:16:14.285 --> 01:16:16.102
(lips smacking)

1372
01:16:16.102 --> 01:16:18.474
(laughs) Give me thy hand.

1373
01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:21.393
I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

1374
01:16:22.294 --> 01:16:26.334
(Meg groans)
(kidnapper laughs)

1375
01:16:26.334 --> 01:16:29.273
(kidnapper groans)

1376
01:16:29.273 --> 01:16:31.203
(kidnapper coughs)

1377
01:16:31.203 --> 01:16:35.039
(suspenseful music continues)

1378
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.365
(thunder rumbling)
(footsteps tapping)

1379
01:16:51.086 --> 01:16:56.090
(kidnapper grunting)
(thunder cracking)

1380
01:16:57.624 --> 01:17:00.209
(Meg whimpers)

1381
01:17:03.616 --> 01:17:06.947
(thunder rumbling)

1382
01:17:06.947 --> 01:17:10.783
(suspenseful music continues)

1383
01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:27.468
(Corin groans)

1384
01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:31.305
(suspenseful music continues)

1385
01:17:52.202 --> 01:17:55.496
(Corin groans)

1386
01:17:55.496 --> 01:18:00.500
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1387
01:18:10.688 --> 01:18:12.132
- Mom?

1388
01:18:12.132 --> 01:18:12.965
Mom, Mom!

1389
01:18:14.133 --> 01:18:15.217
Are you okay?

1390
01:18:17.827 --> 01:18:19.329
- Did you get him?

1391
01:18:20.401 --> 01:18:21.318
- No, come.

1392
01:18:22.713 --> 01:18:24.285
Get up for a sec.

1393
01:18:24.285 --> 01:18:26.620
(Di groans)

1394
01:18:29.528 --> 01:18:33.067
(thunder rumbling)

1395
01:18:33.067 --> 01:18:34.151
That will do.

1396
01:18:36.682 --> 01:18:41.686
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1397
01:18:42.921 --> 01:18:45.590
(door rattling)

1398
01:18:46.686 --> 01:18:49.772
(footsteps thudding)

1399
01:18:54.932 --> 01:18:57.441
(footsteps thudding)

1400
01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:59.943
(Meg panting)

1401
01:19:03.377 --> 01:19:06.815
(suspenseful music continues)

1402
01:19:06.815 --> 01:19:10.013
(loud banging)

1403
01:19:10.013 --> 01:19:13.849
(suspenseful music continues)

1404
01:19:25.856 --> 01:19:27.487
- Peek-a-boo, cherub!

1405
01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:33.033
(kidnapper panting)

1406
01:19:42.769 --> 01:19:46.170
(footsteps tapping)

1407
01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:49.936
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbles)

1408
01:19:49.936 --> 01:19:54.940
(footsteps tapping)
(sword scraping)

1409
01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:03.442
(sword scraping)

1410
01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.364
(thunder rumbles)
(suspenseful music continues)

1411
01:20:22.982 --> 01:20:23.911
(door slams)

1412
01:20:23.911 --> 01:20:27.136
(kidnapper laughs)
(Meg groans)

1413
01:20:27.136 --> 01:20:31.376
(suspenseful music continues)

1414
01:20:31.376 --> 01:20:33.795
Do you like that, cherub, hm?

1415
01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.302
Aye?

1416
01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:42.874
(Meg grunts)

1417
01:20:42.874 --> 01:20:44.986
(suspenseful music continues)

1418
01:20:44.986 --> 01:20:47.853
You got me good there, didn't you?

1419
01:20:47.853 --> 01:20:50.188
Ah, move and I'll slice you.

1420
01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:54.317
(Meg panting)

1421
01:20:54.317 --> 01:20:57.375
You know, my first girl was a redhead.

1422
01:20:59.144 --> 01:21:01.966
Can't have been more than a teenage girl.

1423
01:21:01.966 --> 01:21:05.416
She squealed, she did. (laughs)

1424
01:21:05.416 --> 01:21:06.953
She begged me to let her go.

1425
01:21:08.145 --> 01:21:11.304
I told her she would just
be mine for the weekend,

1426
01:21:11.304 --> 01:21:14.206
and then we'd have to
go back to her daddy.

1427
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.504
I fileted her from ear to
eat before the end of Sunday.

1428
01:21:20.983 --> 01:21:22.369
(kidnapper laughs)

1429
01:21:22.369 --> 01:21:25.258
(kidnapper groans)

1430
01:21:25.258 --> 01:21:28.733
(corkscrew squelches)
(kidnapper screams)

1431
01:21:28.733 --> 01:21:30.869
(mouth spits)

1432
01:21:30.869 --> 01:21:34.627
(suspenseful music)
(thunder rumbling)

1433
01:21:34.627 --> 01:21:35.461
- Meg.

1434
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.154
Meg?

1435
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:42.935
(wind howling)

1436
01:21:43.964 --> 01:21:44.973
Meg.

1437
01:21:44.973 --> 01:21:47.892
(thunder cracking)

1438
01:21:49.676 --> 01:21:52.232
(suspenseful music continues)

1439
01:21:52.232 --> 01:21:54.559
(kidnapper groans)

1440
01:21:54.559 --> 01:21:56.978
(Meg groans)

1441
01:21:59.554 --> 01:22:02.474
(kidnapper laughs)

1442
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:07.407
(suspenseful music continues)

1443
01:22:14.314 --> 01:22:19.319
- Oh, a Turk. (chuckles)

1444
01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:24.773
(thunder cracking)

1445
01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:29.709
(suspenseful music continues)

1446
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:32.412
Can you feel this energy?

1447
01:22:32.412 --> 01:22:35.602
(thunder cracking)

1448
01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:38.104
- You're crazy, you know that?

1449
01:22:38.977 --> 01:22:42.580
- Crazy people have no
clue what they're doing.

1450
01:22:43.418 --> 01:22:44.745
I'm perfectly sane.

1451
01:22:46.423 --> 01:22:49.699
I just do whatever makes me feel alive.

1452
01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.269
(wind howling)

1453
01:22:53.269 --> 01:22:54.923
- You're a fucking psycho.

1454
01:22:56.962 --> 01:22:59.937
- Good wombs have formed bad sons.

1455
01:23:01.311 --> 01:23:03.951
- What, what?

1456
01:23:04.812 --> 01:23:06.099
(thunder cracking)

1457
01:23:06.099 --> 01:23:07.600
- Be brave, child.

1458
01:23:08.952 --> 01:23:13.259
We'll see how brave you are
when you meet your maker.

1459
01:23:14.887 --> 01:23:15.777
(thunder cracking)

1460
01:23:15.777 --> 01:23:16.694
I grant it.

1461
01:23:18.097 --> 01:23:19.014
Or he will.

1462
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.093

1463

(thunder cracking)

1466
01:23:35.117 --> 01:23:35.950
- No.

1467
01:23:37.538 --> 01:23:39.704
- You've bored me enough, girl.

1468
01:23:39.704 --> 01:23:42.866
(Meg cries)

1469
01:23:42.866 --> 01:23:45.318
(thunder cracking)

1470
01:23:45.318 --> 01:23:47.073
- [Corin] No!

1471
01:23:47.073 --> 01:23:50.909
(suspenseful music continues)

1472
01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.363
- Time to die!

1473

(sisters chattering)

1480
01:24:31.632 --> 01:24:33.223

1481
01:24:33.223 --> 01:24:34.754
(sisters chattering)
(lightning striking)

1482
01:24:34.754 --> 01:24:35.838
Mom, come on!

1483
01:24:36.835 --> 01:24:37.669
That's it.

1484
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:39.357
Come on, we need to get out.

1485
01:24:39.357 --> 01:24:41.706

1487
01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:44.036
Come on, we need to go.

1488
01:24:44.036 --> 01:24:46.528
We need to go now, come on.

1489
01:24:46.528 --> 01:24:48.641
That's it, come on.

1490
01:24:48.641 --> 01:24:49.663
Oh my god!

1491
01:24:49.663 --> 01:24:51.378
All right, we need to get
out, it's coming down.

1492
01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:52.212
Go!

1493
01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:59.176

(suspenseful music continues)

1498
01:25:24.418 --> 01:25:25.419
- It's over.

1499
01:25:27.804 --> 01:25:28.888
- We made it.

1500
01:25:29.861 --> 01:25:33.247
(Corin whimpers)

1501
01:25:33.247 --> 01:25:35.738
- Let's go, let's go.

1502
01:25:35.738 --> 01:25:37.340
- Come on.

1503
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.229

1508
01:26:08.176 --> 01:26:10.136
Hi.
- Hey, there.

1509
01:26:10.136 --> 01:26:11.554
- You okay?
- Yes.

1510
01:26:13.266 --> 01:26:15.577
He would be so proud of you.

1511
01:26:15.577 --> 01:26:18.373
Your courage that night and
what you did to save me.

1512
01:26:20.081 --> 01:26:21.766
I have so much to thank you for.

1513
01:26:23.264 --> 01:26:24.723
- [Corin] Meg?

1514
01:26:24.723 --> 01:26:27.122
- Go on, go to your sister.

1515
01:26:27.122 --> 01:26:29.298
- Okay, I love you.
- Love you.

1516
01:26:29.298 --> 01:26:30.899
(lips smacking)

1517
01:26:30.899 --> 01:26:33.902

(footsteps tapping)

1520
01:26:43.454 --> 01:26:44.288
- What are you doing?

1521
01:26:44.288 --> 01:26:47.224
- All right, so I've decided I'm gonna

1522
01:26:47.224 --> 01:26:50.016
paint the ceiling in Dad's
study because it needs it.

1523
01:26:50.016 --> 01:26:54.355
But I'm not sure whether
to use emulsion or gloss.

1524
01:26:54.355 --> 01:26:56.036
- I don't know.

1525
01:26:56.036 --> 01:26:57.312
(both laughing)

1526
01:26:57.312 --> 01:27:00.661
- Well the WiFi's gone
so I can't look it up.

1527
01:27:00.661 --> 01:27:02.747
- Oh, that's weird, I
thought the signal was back.

1528
01:27:02.747 --> 01:27:05.599
- Yeah, it were, but it's gone again.

1529
01:27:05.599 --> 01:27:07.304
Might be some like faulty
wiring or something.

1530
01:27:07.304 --> 01:27:10.253
- Or have you even like
read the cons properly?

1531
01:27:10.253 --> 01:27:11.182
'Cause you know what you're like.

1532
01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:12.986
- Yeah, obviously, you dick.

1533
01:27:12.986 --> 01:27:14.393
(Meg laughs)

1534
01:27:14.393 --> 01:27:17.393
- You know, maybe emulsion or something.

1535
01:27:17.393 --> 01:27:18.690
- Yeah.

1536
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:22.323
- Yeah 'cause I mean gloss is shiny.

1537
01:27:22.323 --> 01:27:24.868
So do you want shiny walls?

1538
01:27:25.918 --> 01:27:27.391
- Shiny!
- Shiny.

1539
01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:29.079
- I'll pick up my brush and
I'll come help you, huh?

1540
01:27:29.079 --> 01:27:30.790
- Okay, cool.

1541
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:33.550
Right, I'll go with this one then.

1542
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:35.444
- [Radio Announcer] Research
into the lightning storm,

1543
01:27:35.444 --> 01:27:38.567
which struck a few months
ago is still ongoing.

1544
01:27:38.567 --> 01:27:41.509
Dr. Becker addressed a summit
yesterday with his theory

1545
01:27:41.509 --> 01:27:45.479
of electrical charge frequency
within these unique storms.

1546
01:27:45.479 --> 01:27:49.713
"In the far north of Iceland,
in largely uninhabited areas,

1547
01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:52.415
"these storms have been more frequent.

1548
01:27:52.415 --> 01:27:55.778
"What my research has suggested
is that a particular charge

1549
01:27:55.778 --> 01:27:59.471
"of lightning is drawn to
the small electrical charge

1550
01:27:59.471 --> 01:28:01.363
"found within mammals.

1551
01:28:01.363 --> 01:28:05.127
"Like most storms, the
striking points are random,

1552
01:28:05.127 --> 01:28:07.338
"but during flurries of lightning,

1553
01:28:07.338 --> 01:28:09.633
"the energy within the
storm begins to hone in

1554
01:28:09.633 --> 01:28:12.442
"to particular striking points.

1555
01:28:12.442 --> 01:28:15.324
"These can be satellites,
electricity pylons,

1556
01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:17.696
"but as we have found, mammals too.

1557
01:28:17.696 --> 01:28:21.029
"This would account for the
significant loss of life

1558
01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.583
"in the last storm."

1559
01:28:22.583 --> 01:28:25.400
Dr. Becker had correctly
predicted the last storm,

1560
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.097
the power of which was unprecedented,

1561
01:28:28.097 --> 01:28:30.990
and which the weather service has denied.

1562
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.081
With a lightning storm due
to come across the East

1563
01:28:33.081 --> 01:28:35.374
of England this afternoon and evening,

1564
01:28:35.374 --> 01:28:37.566
Dr. Becker has made the same warning.

1565
01:28:37.566 --> 01:28:38.597
We'll have more...

1566
01:28:38.597 --> 01:28:39.668
(static buzzing)

1567
01:28:39.668 --> 01:28:42.400
Office has issued an
only Amber alert so far.

1568
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.399
In other news, the Prime
Minister has come under...

1569
01:28:45.399 --> 01:28:46.233
Again...
(static buzzing)

1570
01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:48.400
His alleged ties to Russian Mafia.

(wind howling)

1574
01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.468
- It's back.
