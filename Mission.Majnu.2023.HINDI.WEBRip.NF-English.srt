1
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,416
<i>World War II.</i>

2
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,000
<i>For the first time in the world,
a country used a nuclear bomb.</i>

3
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,000
<i>Though American atomic bombings
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki</i>

4
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,791
<i>put an end to the World War,</i>

5
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>it started a new kind of race
in the world.</i>

6
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,958
<i>A race to build nuclear bombs.</i>

7
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,750
<i>The ultimate symbol of power.</i>

8
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:25,666
<i>1971. Pakistan lost the war
to India for the third time.</i>

9
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,166
<i>They wanted revenge at all costs.</i>

10
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,666
<i>They had only one way left
to defeat India.</i>

11
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,291
<i>To make a nuclear bomb.</i>

12
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,250
<i>However, wars are not won with weapons,
but with intelligence.</i>

13
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,625
<i>And India's trump card was RAW.</i>

14
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:50,250
<i>Our RAW agents infiltrated Pakistan
from Peshawar to Karachi.</i>

15
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,750
<i>They were not tasked to use firearms,</i>

16
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,541
<i>but to find critical information
and send it to Delhi.</i>

17
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,541
<i>Away from their land,
they were the soldiers of the land.</i>

18
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,375
<i>My name is R.N. Kao. I'm the chief of RAW.</i>

19
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,708
<i>And this is the story
of one such gallant soldier.</i>

20
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,916
{\an8}<i>God is great</i>

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
{\an8}<i>God is great</i>

22
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:27,958
<i>I bear witness
That there is no god except the One God</i>

23
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,750
Hey, Anwar!

24
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,083
- Tariq.
- Peace be upon you.

25
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,958
- How are you?
- All well by God's grace, Anwar.

26
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,708
Did you talk to your uncle about me?

27
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,833
I did, but he doesn't need
new workers right now.

28
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,041
If you could arrange a meeting, Anwar.

29
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,833
You won't find a better tailor
than me in all of Pakistan.

30
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,833
We've been doing it
for generations. It's in my blood.

31
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,625
But they don't have an opening.

32
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,416
I hear the army is recruiting people.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,166
Your uncle must be swamped
with orders to sew new uniforms.

34
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,375
Try to understand, Anwar.

35
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,791
I don't want to be stuck
sewing women's clothing forever.

36
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,541
And they drive a hard bargain.

37
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,041
- What can a 2-meter fabric...
- Help him out, Anwar.

38
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,125
He's a God-fearing man.
He prays five times a day.

39
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,708
I'm trying, Maulvi Saab.

40
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,375
- Tell your uncle I recommended him.
- Sure.

41
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,333
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

42
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,916
Thank you so much, Maulvi Saab.

43
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,333
- May God protect you.
- May God protect you.

44
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,458
Army uniforms
are not like women's clothing.

45
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,416
MOMIN TAILORS

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,208
- Do you know how to cut sleeves?
- Yes.

47
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,166
Let me see.

48
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,375
Here.

49
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,250
Thread a needle.

50
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,125
Come on, sir.
I can do it even while I'm sneezing.

51
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,208
Do it.

52
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,875
You better sneeze, boy.
Maybe that'll help.

53
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,541
He needs training.

54
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,583
I'll pay you 300 rupees a month.
Does that work for you?

55
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,375
Who will work for that?
Right, Tariq? Is that okay?

56
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,458
- Works for me.
- He agreed!

57
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,125
You start tomorrow, son.

58
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,875
Be careful! Are you crazy?

59
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,958
- I told you so many times!
- Dad.

60
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,916
- Come on! Get in the car.
- The girl made you lose your mind.

61
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,333
You agreed to work for 300 rupees.

62
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,208
Good.

63
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,833
Nasreen, Uncle Momin's niece.

64
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,750
Poor girl is blind from birth.

65
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,666
Nasreen.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,833
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

67
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,500
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

68
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:49,333
{\an8}<i>How I love you</i>

69
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,750
{\an8}<i>Yeah, my Lord knows</i>

70
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,958
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

71
00:05:55,833 --> 00:06:01,541
{\an8}<i>How I love you</i>

72
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:08,375
{\an8}<i>My heart longs for you
I've lost my heart to you</i>

73
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,583
{\an8}<i>All I wish for is you</i>

74
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,500
{\an8}<i>Yeah, my Lord knows</i>

75
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,458
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

76
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:25,583
{\an8}<i>How I love you</i>

77
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:44,083
{\an8}<i>Oh, those beautiful eyes
Have stolen my heart</i>

78
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:49,416
{\an8}<i>My world is in your eyes</i>

79
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:56,583
{\an8}<i>Oh, those beautiful eyes
Have stolen my heart</i>

80
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,291
{\an8}<i>My world is in your eyes</i>

81
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,958
Why don't you drop me?

82
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,208
You're not as stealthy as you think.

83
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:15,583
I recognize your perfume
from the first day.

84
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,375
Come, let's get going.
It will be dark soon.

85
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,333
I am used to the dark.
Are you afraid of it?

86
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,916
<i>How one falls in love
How the world turns colorful</i>

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,250
{\an8}<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

88
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:46,125
{\an8}<i>What the moonlight is
How the lamps light up</i>

89
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:50,541
{\an8}<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

90
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,500
{\an8}<i>Oh, I wonder how the day rushes by</i>

91
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,750
{\an8}<i>I'm lost in my thoughts</i>

92
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,708
{\an8}<i>All I wish for is you</i>

93
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,916
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

95
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:15,000
{\an8}<i>How I love you</i>

96
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,916
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,208
{\an8}<i>My Lord knows</i>

98
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:26,791
{\an8}<i>How I love you</i>

99
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,750
<i>My Lord knows</i>

100
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,375
<i>My Lord knows</i>

101
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:38,791
<i>How I love you</i>

102
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,833
<i>My Lord knows</i>

103
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,708
<i>My Lord knows</i>

104
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:50,625
<i>How I love you...</i>

105
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,291
How dare you?

106
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:57,041
You'll regret it
if I see you anywhere near her.

107
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,416
- Listen to me.
- He has ill intentions.

108
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,583
How would you feel
if he had eyes for your daughter?

109
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:07,250
I'm holding back because you are
Nasreen's father, or else...

110
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,333
This is his true self. He's a goon.

111
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,125
I love Nasreen.

112
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,291
I want to marry her.

113
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,708
<i>He is a good, honest man,
where will we find anyone better?</i>

114
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,333
So I should hand my daughter
to an illiterate man?

115
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,041
- How will he keep her happy?
- Well, I'm sorry.

116
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:36,541
But you aren't very educated yourself.
Didn't I let you marry my sister?

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,458
If her mom were alive,
she would have talked some sense into her.

118
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:50,666
Dad, you know,
I don't mind that I'm blind.

119
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,583
But after Mom passed away,
I was a burden to you.

120
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:02,750
Tariq gave wings to my confined life.

121
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,458
I breathe freely when I'm with him.

122
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:12,458
No one can love me more than Tariq.

123
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,708
Not even you, Dad.

124
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,916
<i>You see the world with my eyes</i>

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,125
I do.

126
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,666
<i>I put you on my eyelashes</i>

127
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,583
I do.

128
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,166
<i>My Lord knows</i>

129
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,958
<i>My Lord knows</i>

130
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:53,416

<i>My Lord knows</i>

133
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:05,500
<i>How I love you</i>

134
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,708
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

135
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,041
{\an8}<i>six, five, four...</i>

136
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,041
{\an8}<i>...three, two, one...</i>

137
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,916
Mr. Alam, please come.

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,041
I'll read your report tomorrow.
It's my wife's birthday today.

139
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,666
It's not a report, sir.
It's news from India.

140
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:54,458
<i>We would like to tell our audience
that India has successfully carried out</i>

141
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,458
<i>its first nuclear bomb test explosion.</i>

142
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,250
<i>This operation was codenamed
Smiling Buddha.</i>

143
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,500
<i>And it was carried out
in Pokhran, Rajasthan</i>

144
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,750
<i>under the supervision
of the Indian Army and scientists.</i>

145
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,416
Hello.

146
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,416
- Can you hear me?
- Hello.

147
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,833
Yes, please speak.

148
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,291
I am listening to you.

149
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,500
Sir, what about this cake?

150
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,916
Sir, India has declared it
a peaceful nuclear test.

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,458
Peaceful nuclear test, my foot!

152
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,708
Consider it a threat from India.

153
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,583
We've already lost East Pakistan.

154
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,916
Now, we'll lose Kashmir as well.

155
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,708
We must accelerate
our nuclear weapon's program, sir.

156
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,791
That's what I wanted to hear.

157
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:59,291
Sir, we need a nuclear physicist
and metallurgical engineer for it.

158
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,583
And I think there's only one guy
who can do it.

159
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,791
A.Q. Khan. Abdul Qadeer Khan.

160
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,666
What do you say, Mr. Alam?

161
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,708
We can't trust him, sir.

162
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,375
Even while he was in Pakistan,
he has broken many laws.

163
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,250
Sir, he's doing
groundbreaking work in Holland.

164
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,875
He just wants results,
and he will do anything for it.

165
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,583
Then he's our man. Exactly who we need.

166
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,416
We need him back in Pakistan.

167
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,583
We must keep this mission
a secret from the world.

168
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,375
For Pakistan.

169
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,250
We will starve, eat grass,

170
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,791
but Pakistan will build a nuclear bomb!

171
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,833
<i>Pakistan was ready to go to any extent
to make a nuclear bomb.</i>

172
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,916
<i>And to make it happen,
they brought in A.Q. Khan.</i>

173
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,833
<i>The most dangerous scientist in the world.</i>

174
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,708
- Welcome home, sir.
- Welcome home.

175
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,916
- How was your journey?
- Good.

176
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,833
<i>He was now
Pakistan's most important asset.</i>

177
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:13,000
<i>And Pakistan left no stone unturned
to keep his family happy.</i>

178
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,000
Welcome home, Mr. Khan.

179
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,208
It's time to put India in its place.

180
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,750
<i>Hidden from the world,</i>

181
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,166
<i>a location was chosen
for the nuclear facility.</i>

182
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,541
<i>Project 706, Pakistan's top secret.</i>

183
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,791
The international community
must come together

184
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,208
to condemn India's irresponsible actions.

185
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,166
<i>On one hand,
PM Bhutto was pointing fingers at India.</i>

186
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,125
<i>On the other, his illegal
nuclear program was in full swing.</i>

187
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,333
<i>Enter Colonel Gadhafi of Libya.</i>

188
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:50,208
<i>He's a terrorist to the world,
but for Pakistan, he's a close ally.</i>

189
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,875
<i>Gadhafi provided 500 million dollars
in funding to Pakistan.</i>

190
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,416
<i>Banned nuclear components were smuggled in
from the European black market.</i>

191
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,333
<i>And the uranium used in the nuclear bomb
was smuggled in from Africa.</i>

192
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,083
<i>Pakistan was very close
to achieving its goal.</i>

193
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:16,000
{\an8}I request the international community
to put sanctions against India.

194
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,750
{\an8}To stop its heinous designs.

195
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,666
This is the main centrifuge area.

196
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,625
- The outer perimeter.
- And the inner perimeter?

197
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,541
- No, I mean...
<i>- Now for some special news.</i>

198
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:28,875
<i>Today in United Nations, Pakistan has got
an important victory against India.</i>

199
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,416
<i>Declaring the Pokhran
explosions irresponsible,</i>

200
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,541
{\an8}<i>India's atomic program
has been put on hold.</i>

201
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,666
You burned it, didn't you?

202
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,375
Yikes.

203
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,458
That's what happens
when you cook on high heat.

204
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,500
- Okay.
- Move.

205
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,208
I'll be jinxed
if you keep staring like this.

206
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:07,875
It's my right
to look at you to my heart's content,

207
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,875
for I'm your husband, love of my life.

208
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,791
Bravo, my Shakespeare!

209
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,500
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

210
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,000
That's enough now.
The doctor advised you to rest.

211
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,000
There are five months to go.
I can't rest so long.

212
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,708
All right, then.

213
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,916
Are you leaving early today?

214
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,125
Yeah, Uncle is coming in late today.
So I have to open the shop.

215
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,916
Well, won't you kiss him goodbye today?

216
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,000
<i>Traitor, come out!</i>

217
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,666
After all...

218
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,125
Traitor, come out!

219
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,958
- Traitor, come out!
- Break the door.

220
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,708
What's the matter?
Are you worried about the baby again?

221
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,208
No. I'm just a bit anxious.

222
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,666
- It's a huge responsibility.
- Lord Almighty has blessed us.

223
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,875
Trust me. You'll be the best dad.

224
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,208
{\an8}Sir!

225
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,416
I don't care if I live or die.

226
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,750
But as long as I'm alive,
I'll continue to serve.

227
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,166
I'll serve this nation and its people.

228
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,458
Mr. Kao is here. Look.

229
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,375
- Who should be our PM?
- Mother of our nation!

230
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,083
RAW Chief is here from Delhi.

231
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,916
It must be a national emergency.

232
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,875
Madam, it is a national emergency.

233
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,291
Pakistan is making a nuclear bomb.

234
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,875
We have intel from Europe

235
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:14,250
that Pakistan bought banned
nuclear components from the black market

236
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,000
and imported uranium from Africa.

237
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,166
They stopped us
and are making one themselves?

238
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,625
We did everything legally.

239
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,583
Madam, we need to expose Pakistan.

240
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,791
The world needs to know the truth.

241
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,708
Where is their nuclear facility?

242
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,291
It's Pakistan's top secret.
No one knows about it.

243
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,708
It's a radical country.

244
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,291
Before launching
a nuclear attack on India...

245
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,791
You know they won't think twice.

246
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,166
I absolutely agree.

247
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,166
Pakistan is very close
to conducting nuclear tests.

248
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,916
And we must find their nuclear facility
and neutralize it before that.

249
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,375
What if it starts a war?

250
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,166
Wars only scare
those who have never won one.

251
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,458
Pakistan should worry about it, not us.

252
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,416
We are running out of time, Madam.

253
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,166
And we don't need ammunition here.
We need intelligence.

254
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,541
Someone who can pull this off
without attracting any attention.

255
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,958
And you have
someone like that in Pakistan?

256
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,041
I have just the right man for the job.

257
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,750
I trust you, Kao. Give him the mission.

258
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,333
India is counting on him.

259
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,166
<i>After declaring an emergency,</i>

260
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,125
<i>election campaigns
are in full swing in India.</i>

261
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,916
<i>Because of sensitive relations
with New Delhi...</i>

262
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,125
Dear, switch off the radio.

263
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:32,250
They keep yapping
about India and Pakistan all day.

264
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,625
- Yeah.
- Here, Tariq. Have some.

265
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,625
The food is delicious.

266
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,208
Dad, have some.

267
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,666
- No.
- Here.

268
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,500
One shouldn't act greedy
while visiting someone else's house.

269
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,416
Someone else's house?

270
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,958
You are the eldest in this family.
Please have some.

271
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,500
So, Tariq, have you started
looking for a better job?

272
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,708
Or do you plan to keep my daughter
stuck in that shack forever?

273
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,708
Dad, it's my house too.

274
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,583
I won't listen to this anymore.

275
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,333
Come on, brother.

276
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,958
- It was better with the radio on.
<i>- India's increasing...</i>

277
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,166
Nasreen.

278
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,333
I have to visit Naved
after dropping you home.

279
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,875
He got a new order from Dubai.

280
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm thinking
of starting a business with him.

281
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,416
Since when did Dad's jabs
start bothering you?

282
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,541
Sometimes I feel he's right.

283
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,875
You could have found
someone better than me.

284
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,500
Well, that's true.

285
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,166
I just married you
because of this scooter.

286
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,625
If I wanted to,
I could have even married Dharmendra.

287
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,000
Why do girls love that actor so much?

288
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,375
And you haven't even seen him.

289
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
I haven't seen you either.

290
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,458
But that voice is all that he needs.

291
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:02,833
"I'll kill each one of you!"

292
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,750
- "Gabbar Singh, here I come!"
- "Gabbar Singh, here I come!"

293
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,666
Tariq.

294
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,708
So, Mr. Romeo,
have you tucked the blind girl in bed?

295
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:01,916
Are you angry?

296
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:07,208
<i>Look, Romeo, she's just a cover.
She's not your real wife.</i>

297
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,125
Yes, sir.

298
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,833
And I hear you've started praying
five times a day.

299
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,041
Your traitor father
must be dancing in his grave.

300
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,708
Shall we get to the point, sir?

301
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,000
Well, I think you are useless.

302
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,833
<i>But unfortunately, the boss trusts you.</i>

303
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,791
Do you hear me?

304
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,833
Yes, sir.

305
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,500
I guess you know
about our fireworks in Pokhran.

306
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,416
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

307
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,833
Our neighbors also want to do it.

308
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,958
They say,
"Our fireworks will make your jaw drop."

309
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,375
We asked them
where they are getting those from,

310
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,958
<i>where they plan to make them,
but they won't tell us.</i>

311
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:46,416
- You must find that location.
- Okay, sir.

312
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,083
And this operation will be called

313
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,041
Mission Majnu.

314
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,125
Okay, sir.

315
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,000
There's a roadside
food stall at Chakri Road.

316
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,416
Go there and tell them
that you want Gorilla brand spices.

317
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,333
Okay, sir.

318
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,333
And now... say your real name.

319
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,416
- That's not the protocol, sir.
- Name!

320
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,375
- Amandeep Singh.
<i>- Full name.</i>

321
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,833
<i>Come on, come out, traitor. Come out!</i>

322
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,333
Surrender now!

323
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,500
<i>- Break the door!
- Traitor!</i>

324
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,750
<i>Amandeep Ajitpal Singh.</i>

325
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,166
<i>Bloody son of a traitor.</i>

326
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,583
<i>Just rot there!</i>

327
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,791
{\an8}To find Pakistan's nuclear facility,
we need our best man.

328
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,708
We can't screw this up.

329
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:01,000
Speak frankly, Mishra.
I chose you because you have no filter.

330
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,333
So, tell me.

331
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,000
Sir, Amandeep is a mistake.

332
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,500
You're making a blunder
by giving him this mission.

333
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,625
The whole department is against it.

334
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:16,000
It was his father who had sold sensitive
military information to Pakistan.

335
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,083
Then how can Amandeep be reliable, sir?

336
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,333
His father betrayed the country
and the son is paying penance.

337
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,416
What could be a better reason?

338
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,166
If it were anyone else,

339
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,583
they would have changed their name
and lived an easy life.

340
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,541
But Aman took the tough path.

341
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,416
Amandeep is the number one cadet
in the history of the academy.

342
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,416
My best student!

343
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,458
He won't let India down.

344
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,500
But what is his reference point?

345
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,833
Where will he start?

346
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,125
Pakistan Army's headquarters
are in Rawalpindi.

347
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,750
And Aman knows that Pakistan

348
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,208
is not run by the government,
but by its army.

349
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,750
Hey, man! One tandoori please.

350
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,958
With Gorilla brand spices.

351
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,250
Darling, do you plan
to stay here till we get married?

352
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,541
Hey!

353
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,333
This gun is for you.

354
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,125
Sharma asked me to hand it to you.

355
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,291
And you turn me into minced meat.

356
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,583
Angry young man.

357
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,875
I want an account of every single penny.

358
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:15,500
I'm a spy, not an accountant.

359
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:18,833
Oh, my God.

360
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,541
A lover!

361
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:26,416
So she's your wife.
I hope you haven't fallen in love.

362
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:33,625
They teach us in training.
Whatever you do, be thorough with it.

363
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,000
Maybe you were sleeping in class.

364
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,666
How did you know? I really used to sleep.

365
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,583
But don't take me for a fool.

366
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,375
I'm a badass.

367
00:26:56,666 --> 00:27:02,041
To fool around is one thing,
but marriage... Never.

368
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,666
I've seen many like you.

369
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,208
A man can turn soft.

370
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:15,333
Take the gun!

371
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,250
You keep it.

372
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,833
That's not how I work.

373
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:22,666
Of course. You work
with your killer eyes, Mr. Romeo.

374
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,000
At least ask my name.

375
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,916
- Tell me.
- Aslam Usmaniya.

376
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,291
That's my real name. My food is real too.

377
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:36,333
Maybe bring your wife along some day.

378
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,208
<i>Come and see me if you wish</i>

379
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,958
<i>Or go to hell, darling</i>

380
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,583
<i>Sir, he's quite something.</i>

381
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,000
<i>Fit and tall with personality.</i>

382
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,916
He's a man of few words.
And he's tough too.

383
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,625
Should I get your sister married to him?

384
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:59,875
Sir, all I mean is he's quite a guy.

385
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,291
Keep an eye on him.

386
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,083
<i>And don't cozy up too much.</i>

387
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:07,583
If he messes up,
you'll be the one to shoot him.

388
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,875
<i>Got it?</i>

389
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,541
I had to lock it. The bill got expensive.

390
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,541
They make calls behind my back.

391
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:39,333
And here are the keys

392
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,541
in case you need to make a call.

393
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah. Thank you.

394
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,958
- Shall I deliver the uniform?
- Yeah.

395
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,750
The one on top is for the brigadier.
Deliver that first.

396
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,416
- Okay.
- Yeah.

397
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,791
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

398
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,166
<i>Shut down your shop,
if you can't do your job well!</i>

399
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,250
Sorry, sir. I'll send someone right away.

400
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,375
Yeah, sure.

401
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,375
- Rasheed!
- Yeah.

402
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,208
Hurry to the brigadier's place.

403
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,916
- What's the matter, Uncle?
- They're all useless.

404
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,125
Two buttons are missing
from the brigadier's uniform.

405
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, don't worry.

406
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,583
Give me the buttons.
I'll go and fix it right away.

407
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,500
- And I'll apologize too.
- Yes.

408
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,833
That's better. He'll be glad to see
someone from the family.

409
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,125
- Okay.
- Here.

410
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,708
- Take these buttons.
- Okay.

411
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,750
- You are here to see the brigadier?
- Yes, sir.

412
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,500
Go on.

413
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,875
Sir, your tea.

414
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:16,791
Would you like some tea?

415
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,541
No, sir, I just realized.

416
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,166
You attended my wedding.

417
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:23,666
Right.

418
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,041
- Aren't you Rasool's son-in-law?
- Yes.

419
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,583
That's why you looked familiar.
All well with you?

420
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,875
Yes, by God's grace.

421
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,750
I'll be a dad soon, sir.

422
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,666
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

423
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,750
I've decided already.

424
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,916
If it's a boy, he'll join the army, sir.

425
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,916
Good.

426
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,541
If I were in the army,
you would have seen me

427
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,208
shoot each one of those Indians.

428
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,166
But I would've spared Hema Malini.

429
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:58,000
Sir, I read in the newspaper

430
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,625
that the Indians are making
a bomb called "Atom"

431
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,583
that can destroy all of Pakistan.

432
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,250
Look, if anything happens to my family,

433
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,000
I won't spare them, sir.

434
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,916
They don't practice what they preach.

435
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,666
They can even fix a cricket match.

436
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,875
That won't happen.

437
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:20,958
- Pakistan is not less than India.
- But we don't have an atom bomb, sir.

438
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,666
Well, we'll have one.

439
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,041
But how? We don't have
the money nor qualified people.

440
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:31,250
I won't make my son a soldier.
I'll make him an atom bomb expert, sir.

441
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,958
My son will make
an atom bomb for Pakistan.

442
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,166
We don't have to wait that long.

443
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,666
Pakistani scientists
are educated and intelligent.

444
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,875
They are here from abroad.

445
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,375
God willing, we'll get the good news soon.

446
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,291
Sir, are we making a bomb?

447
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:04,333
Victory to us!
Victory to Pakistan! Victory to us...

448
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:07,125
But where are they making it?
In Rawalpindi?

449
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,916
Because I want to see it, sir.

450
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,250
Well, it's around here.

451
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,333
Everyone will see it.

452
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,916
Eid celebrations will be grand this time.

453
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:55,000
Sir, it's not confirmed yet,
but there'll be fireworks before Eid.

454
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:58,666
It could very well be tomorrow.
Just give me the location.

455
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,916
It's not confirmed yet,

456
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,958
<i>but the probability is high
it'll be around Rawalpindi.</i>

457
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,625
{\an8}<i>Your assumptions are useless to me.</i>

458
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:08,291
{\an8}<i>That's why I said, sir,
it's not confirmed yet.</i>

459
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,833
I need more time and...

460
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,375
So when will you confirm?
After they destroy Delhi?

461
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,291
Protocol, sir!

462
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,958
To hell with your protocol.

463
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,791
My line is secure.
And I don't care about you.

464
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,791
<i>We don't have to wait that long.</i>

465
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,458
Pakistani scientists
are educated and intelligent.

466
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,541
Hey. I would like that book
on nuclear physics, please.

467
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:29,916
<i>Sir, I have no idea
what kind of investigation he is doing.</i>

468
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
He's either out buying books
or at the library.

469
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,583
PAKISTAN ARMY WILL BE
A GREAT POWER BY 1980

470
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,500
Dr. Faisal, Arif, Azam.

471
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:57,291
Azam... Where have I seen that name before?

472
00:34:58,875 --> 00:34:59,833
Yes!

473
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,958
<i>It's just research and analysis.
Forget about seeing any action.</i>

474
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,916
He was angry when he came,
but I don't know what's going on now.

475
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,291
Damn it.

476
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,291
Nasreen! Are you okay?

477
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,833
Had I known
there'd be so many toilet trips,

478
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,500
I would never have gotten pregnant.

479
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,458
- Can I help?
- What would you do?

480
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,375
Nobody can help, but I need to sit down.

481
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:37,333
Now I know why they have
western toilets abroad.

482
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,708
Pakistani scientists
are educated and intelligent.

483
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,916
They are here from abroad.

484
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,750
- What are you doing?
- What would I do without you?

485
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,833
Come on. I have to rush to the bathroom.

486
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,875
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

487
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,791
- Do you have western toilets?
- Western toilets?

488
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,208
You seem to enjoy luxuries, mister.

489
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,541
Squat toilets work better though.

490
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,125
Hey, do you have western toilets here?

491
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,333
BILLA'S SANITARY WARE SHOP

492
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,000
No, you won't get it anywhere.

493
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,833
It has to be ordered specially.

494
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,875
- Okay.
- It's quite a process to get it.

495
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,625
Though I did get it done
on government orders a few years back.

496
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,125
I had a tough time.

497
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,750
I need it urgently.

498
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,541
My mom struggles to use squat toilets.

499
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,166
- May Almighty help her.
- Yeah.

500
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,291
- It'll be quite expensive.
- I have the advance payment right here.

501
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,333
- All right. It's 500 rupees.
- Okay.

502
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,666
- And 100 rupees for the labor...
- Here you go.

503
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,541
Consider it done.

504
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,000
- Listen.
- Yeah?

505
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,375
Well, I'm spending so much...

506
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:17,666
If I could see the job you did before,
I would feel a lot better.

507
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,166
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.

508
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,750
- Where is it?
- The address should be here.

509
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:26,083
Where is Shahi Street?

510
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,208
Here it is. There it is.

511
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,958
In all of Rawalpindi,

512
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,541
only Billa can get this done.

513
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:38,875
Fantastic! Thank you.

514
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,083
<i>House of the People,
elections results are out</i>

515
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:46,125
<i>and, by winning 298 seats,
the Janata Party has defeated</i>

516
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:49,666
<i>Madam's government with a full majority.</i>

517
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,083
<i>This defeat is attributed to the emergency
declared by the prime minister.</i>

518
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:58,125
<i>This is the worst result
the current government has ever faced.</i>

519
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,875
<i>As per our sources...</i>

520
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:03,250
You lost the Raebareli seat, Madam.

521
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:04,958
Good.

522
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,291
Now I'll have the time
to read some good books.

523
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:12,250
Who is being elected
as the next PM by the alliance?

524
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,583
This is Mahatma Gandhi's nation.

525
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,708
Government can never be
bigger than the constitution.

526
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:26,125
The abuse faced by the citizens
during the emergency

527
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,208
will be compensated.

528
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,333
That sounds like revenge to me, Mr. PM.

529
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:33,583
To me, it sounds like justice.

530
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,208
Will we see a change
in Pakistan policy, Mr. PM?

531
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,250
Anything can be resolved through talks.

532
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:41,125
They are our closest neighbors.

533
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,166
They should be our closest friend too.

534
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,958
Don't you think
that will be difficult, Mr. PM?

535
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,958
You are very difficult
to convince, my friend.

536
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,625
All good things are difficult to achieve.

537
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,166
But my government...

538
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,166
will not stop trying.

539
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,416
But, sir...

540
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,333
<i>End this investigation.</i>

541
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,041
It's a waste of time and money.

542
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:08,666
Thanks to the conspiracy theories
you and your Madam came up with,

543
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,875
our relationships
with neighboring countries are ruined.

544
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,208
I beg to differ, sir.

545
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,125
Because of our intel,
even Israeli's Mossad

546
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,500
is looking for
Pakistan's nuclear facility.

547
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:24,208
Sir, I don't think you realize
how dangerous this situation is.

548
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:27,916
Pakistan has made a deal with Gadhafi.

549
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,500
They'll provide nuclear bombs
in exchange for funding.

550
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:35,625
And soon, every Islamic dictator
and terrorist group will have this bomb!

551
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:40,791
Sir, this could start World War III.
That's why Israel wants to stop Pakistan.

552
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,875
And Pakistan is a direct threat to us.

553
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,041
We have to continue
this mission on a war footing, sir.

554
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,375
Mr. Kao,

555
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:54,375
these issues can only be resolved
through peace talks and diplomacy.

556
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,458
Violence won't change anything.

557
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,291
End this mission.

558
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:00,958
Okay, sir.

559
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:05,958
Then you should post diplomats
on the borders too.

560
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,000
Why do we need an army?

561
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,500
50% budget cut.

562
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,000
Then we'll have to stop
half our operations.

563
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,250
Our new PM thinks we are spies
for the opposition party.

564
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,208
What were you expecting?

565
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:26,833
So, what did you say?

566
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:28,416
I resigned.

567
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,833
Sir?

568
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,833
This is the only way
to divert PM's attention from RAW.

569
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:38,208
Continue the operation in Pakistan.

570
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,000
Away from PM's eyes.

571
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,000
This is my last order.

572
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,125
Yes, sir.

573
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,250
Stop.

574
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:08,541
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

575
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,666
- Is Shahi Street this way?
- Yes. Who are you?

576
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,750
- Plumber.
- I see.

577
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,333
Madam called me.

578
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,333
Madam called you?

579
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,666
Hey, where are you going?

580
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,166
Madam, are your neighbors not here?

581
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,250
They left seven months back.

582
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,583
- Okay.
- Did they not pay your dues?

583
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,166
- Actually...
- Come here.

584
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,291
Okay.

585
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,000
Thank you, madam.

586
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,875
Weren't some foreigners living here?

587
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:57,041
No, the husband was a Pathan.

588
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,125
I see.

589
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:01,250
But his wife was a foreigner.

590
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,208
Okay.

591
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,208
What was his name, madam?

592
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,083
I don't know,
but they called him Mr. Khan.

593
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,166
I see.

594
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,625
Would you like some tea, son?

595
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:13,041
Sure, I would love some.

596
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,708
Thank you.

597
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,750
Yes, madam.

598
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:20,166
Those people...

599
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,000
They never talked to anyone
or made friends with anyone.

600
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:25,958
I see.

601
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:29,791
- I even invited them over for tea one day.
- Really?

602
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,458
She just made a face and left.

603
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,375
Madam, what did he do for a living?

604
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,208
Well, I don't know,

605
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:44,166
but a government vehicle
came to pick him up every morning.

606
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,333
Along with a military guard.

607
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,000
And that woman
would come outside in just a slip,

608
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,791
and go, "Bye-bye."

609
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,000
She'd come to see him off.

610
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,208
Good heavens.

611
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,958
Good heavens.

612
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,791
How did he look, madam?

613
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,000
How did he look?
Well, like all our Pathans.

614
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,291
Big and tall.

615
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,166
Didn't they have any kids?

616
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,375
Yes, they had two daughters.

617
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:13,291
They were around the same age as Gullu.

618
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,333
And they used to play together sometimes.

619
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,000
Hi, Gullu. Come here.
Which school do you attend?

620
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,083
Who are you?

621
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:26,375
Peace be upon you.

622
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:29,500
Your foreign neighbors
left without paying my dues.

623
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:33,083
- Well, that's how they are.
- Yeah.

624
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,041
They were the ones
who looted India and Pakistan.

625
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,625
Yes. We won't spare them.

626
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,833
They caused the partition.
They divided us...

627
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,708
- Peace be upon you.
- Tariq!

628
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:50,541
Nasreen's dad came by.

629
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,291
He took her to the hospital.

630
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:54,791
Hospital?

631
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,583
- What happened, Nasreen?
- It's nothing.

632
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,500
I just felt dizzy.

633
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,708
- Don't worry.
- How can we not?

634
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:13,500
Thank God I came by.
What if something happened to you?

635
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,125
Dad, please don't start again.

636
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:20,916
Well, where were you?
You weren't at the shop.

637
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,250
Tariq is really busy with work.

638
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,375
Please don't make a scene.

639
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:28,750
- What else does he do?
- Dad, please leave.

640
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,416
I'll go home with him.
May God protect you.

641
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:04,875
Come on.

642
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,250
- Hey.
- Come on.

643
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,333
Very good, Gullu.

644
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:18,000
Do you know about their dad's work?

645
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:23,166
Okay, Gullu, what were their names?

646
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:25,375
Sabah and Sara.

647
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,458
Sabah was nice
but Sara always fought with me.

648
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:29,416
Really?

649
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,708
Which school did they attend?

650
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:36,125
That English school. Mary something.

651
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,916
Very good.

652
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,166
Form a line. One by one. Don't run.

653
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,750
Hey! Where are you off to, mister?

654
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,000
Who do you want to meet?

655
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,500
Forget me. Meet Jinnah.

656
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,375
Come on. Take it.

657
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,875
Here are the admission records.

658
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,083
I don't know,
but they called him Mr. Khan.

659
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,416
Here's some tea, sir.

660
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:30,833
Sir, A.Q. Khan is the scientist
who is here from abroad.

661
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,333
The facility must be in here.

662
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:35,500
Man, I ask for a chicken
and you hand me an egg.

663
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,750
Sir, this name
is critical for the mission.

664
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,833
I need some more resources...

665
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:44,333
I won't waste my resources on the basis
of the toilet they use to take a dump.

666
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:46,791
Finer details
make the bigger picture, sir!

667
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,416
Kao always taught us that...

668
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,541
He's gone, son.
Your boss has abandoned you.

669
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,666
Now, you're under my control.

670
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,125
You can hate me all you like.

671
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:00,791
But imagine if I turn out to be right.

672
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,500
How can you be right?

673
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,958
You're your father's son after all.

674
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:10,458
And your child will be born
with the same dirty blood.

675
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:14,500
"Blessed be the sacred land,
happy be the bounteous realm."

676
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:15,666
<i>Teach him that.</i>

677
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,916
Your mission is over.

678
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,541
- Sir...
- You are dismissed.

679
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:20,541
Sir!

680
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,166
I always knew you were up to something.

681
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,791
Your behavior was always off.

682
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,666
Who knows what else you are hiding.

683
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,416
Tell me! How long has this been going on?

684
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:53,500
- Tell me.
- It's not what you think.

685
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,750
Damn it...

686
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,625
Who were you talking to?
Speak, you asshole.

687
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:02,250
Who is your mistress?

688
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,125
I've even seen you
with your son at the playground.

689
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:12,833
I won't let you
live with my daughter. Never!

690
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:15,500
I'll tell her everything. Everything!

691
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,500
<i>There's a problem, sir.</i>

692
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,458
His father-in-law heard his conversation.

693
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:24,458
Cover's blown. Means he's a goner.

694
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,208
Sir?

695
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,291
Finish Tariq.

696
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:21,541
Tariq.

697
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,208
Tariq, someone is at the door.

698
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,291
Wait here. I'll get that.

699
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,625
<i>In theory, Pakistan is a democracy.</i>

700
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:13,500
<i>But in reality,
the military runs the country.</i>

701
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:17,000
{\an8}<i>The PM's chair could be toppled.</i>

702
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:21,791
{\an8}<i>General Zia-ul-Haq
was a very cunning and radical dictator.</i>

703
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,625
<i>Things were going
to get tougher for India.</i>

704
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:30,083
This location is surrounded by these hills
and drilling is going on here.

705
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:32,916
Once we have the exact depth
and integrity of the tunnel,

706
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,583
we'll transfer the device
from the nuclear facility.

707
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,916
It'll be a swift operation, sir.

708
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,625
Mr. Khan, you have made Pakistan proud.

709
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,375
Please relax for a while.

710
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,541
It's not easy to get an appointment
for a drink with you.

711
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,583
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

712
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,583
Shoot!

713
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:04,250
General Zia-ul-Haq. Put your guns down!

714
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:07,875
Sir.

715
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:12,583
Mr. Prime Minister, you're under arrest
for corruption and money embezzlement.

716
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,541
Pakistan won't be governed
by corrupt politicians,

717
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,291
but by the Pakistani Army.

718
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,541
O Ever-living and Sustainer,
with your mercy, we appeal.

719
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:41,666
I bear witness
that there is no deity but Allah

720
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:47,125
And Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah.

721
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,291
If anyone wants to pay their respects...

722
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:13,291
I bear witness that there
is no god except the One God.

723
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,083
They were thieves.
They shot him and took off.

724
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,208
This city is going to the dogs.

725
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,041
My brother-in-law...

726
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,500
{\an8}Tariq, let me explain. Listen...

727
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:25,833
He didn't know anything.

728
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:29,125
You don't think before you act.

729
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,041
"Cover's blown. Means he's a goner."

730
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,416
Didn't Sharma say this?

731
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,458
For the first time,
Aslam defied his orders.

732
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
He saved your life.

733
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:54,916
Who are you?

734
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,791
I've been living
in Pakistan for nine years.

735
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:00,791
Senior Field Officer Raman Singh.

736
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,250
I know Aslam.

737
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:06,125
And now I get to meet you officially.

738
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:09,875
Agent? You are both Sharma's pets!

739
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,333
Calm down, Tariq!

740
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:12,875
Don't interfere with my work.

741
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,416
I won't stop till I finish this mission.

742
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,416
You can tell Sharma that.

743
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:23,041
A.Q. Khan! I was watching him too.

744
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,875
I submitted a report four years ago.

745
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:26,375
No one bothered to read it.

746
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:29,583
We can work together.

747
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:31,708
We are running out of time.

748
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,458
- Are the maps in order?
- Yes, sir.

749
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,125
- Evening, everyone.
- Evening, sir.

750
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:41,083
What's the news from the Jews?

751
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,666
Sir, according to Mossad,

752
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,958
the nuclear facility is in Quetta.

753
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:45,875
Source of intel?

754
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,208
Issac. He's our contact in Tel Aviv.

755
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,875
He said there's a lot
of military movement in Quetta.

756
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,083
The Israelis are planning
an aerial attack on Quetta.

757
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,083
- When?
- No confirmation yet.

758
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:59,500
And he has shared some aerial photos, sir.

759
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:02,583
Sir, Mossad's information is never wrong.

760
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,375
How about yours?

761
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,750
Ladies and gentlemen!

762
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,875
Martial law has been declared in Pakistan.

763
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:16,458
General Zia-ul-Haq will now lead
Pakistan from Islamabad.

764
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:19,958
After her dad's demise,

765
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:22,833
she has forgotten to smile.

766
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,625
He was both her mom and dad.

767
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,916
We have to clean all the crockery at home.

768
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,833
Nasreen is very quiet at home too.

769
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:41,416
Can she stay here for a few days?
It might cheer her up.

770
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,666
Yeah, I think that's better.

771
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,666
This is her maternal home.

772
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:51,291
Sorry, Uncle. I couldn't come to work
for the last few days.

773
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:54,125
Don't worry about work.

774
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,083
We're going through a rough patch.

775
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,000
What do you mean?

776
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,000
What happened?

777
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,833
I lost an order of 400 new uniforms.

778
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:05,125
Four hundred?

779
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,416
It was the biggest order this year.

780
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:10,625
It was a uniform with a new design.

781
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:14,166
That rascal Hamid got the order instead.

782
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,416
Come on. Food is served.

783
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,333
As God wills.

784
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:28,541
Tariq!

785
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,625
Why are you avoiding me?

786
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,916
I'm not, Nasreen.

787
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,375
Then what is it?

788
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:41,291
I need you the most right now.

789
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,958
And you are pushing me away.

790
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:51,125
For the last few days,
you have been distracted.

791
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:56,041
Please tell me what's bothering you.

792
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,291
I don't have an answer for you.

793
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,958
I'm not with you just for the good times.

794
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:15,083
Don't you trust me?

795
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,458
Prime Minister's office.

796
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:33,333
Excuse me, sir.
There's a scheduled call from Pakistan.

797
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:36,375
- General Zia-ul-Haq is on the line.
- Thank you.

798
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:40,708
General Zia.

799
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:42,333
Mr. PM, how are you?

800
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,875
Good. How are you?

801
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,250
<i>All is well by God's grace.</i>

802
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,791
- You must have received the news.
<i>- Yes.</i>

803
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,416
It was a corrupt administration, Mr. PM.

804
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,166
<i>So I had to take this step.</i>

805
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:57,375
I am sure you took this step
after thinking it through, General.

806
00:59:57,458 --> 01:00:02,291
But I hope you'll restore
democracy in Pakistan soon.

807
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:04,750
I completely agree with you.

808
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:05,916
And I assure you,

809
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,583
we'll announce elections
within three months.

810
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:11,916
We must maintain
this transparency between our nations.

811
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,916
That's why I made
the first call to you, Mr. PM.

812
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:17,791
Our closest neighbor
should be our closest friend.

813
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:21,208
<i>- It's most important for Pakistan.</i>
- And also for India.

814
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:22,166
<i>Thank you, Mr. PM.</i>

815
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,291
God willing, we'll talk again soon.

816
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,375
Of course. Bye.

817
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:27,375
Bye.

818
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:32,333
- Who is next?
- China, sir.

819
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,416
Hamid!

820
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,833
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

821
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:49,541
I hear you got an order
for 1,000 uniforms.

822
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:52,291
No. That's just a rumor.

823
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,375
It's just for 400 jackets.

824
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:58,625
But wasn't the order for jackets
already fulfilled for this season?

825
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:03,083
It's a special order.
They are using a new material.

826
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:05,250
Anyway, as long as we get good business.

827
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,791
Tell me if you need
any help delivering it.

828
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,166
I'll get my scooter.

829
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,625
I don't have to worry about it.
The army will pick it up themselves.

830
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,541
Wow. We usually have to make
ten trips to the army camp.

831
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,666
But you're being treated like a VIP.

832
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:23,416
They are taking them
somewhere else, not the army camp.

833
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:25,208
Really?

834
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,083
Please tell me where
and I'll open a shop there.

835
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:33,166
Had I known, I would've opened
one myself, young man.

836
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,458
Before you did.

837
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:36,708
- May God protect you, Tariq.
- May God protect you.

838
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:43,291
Lord, free us from the cycle
of death but not from immortality.

839
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,250
Hail Lord Shiva.

840
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:51,208
Tariq, what's the plan?

841
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:54,333
An order of 400 army jackets
is leaving Rawalpindi tomorrow.

842
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:58,041
The army will make
the pickup themselves. This is a first.

843
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:01,083
Let's follow them.

844
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,500
I say let's kidnap them.

845
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,291
Shut up!

846
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:08,166
An innocent man died
because of your rash ways.

847
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,541
Nonsense.

848
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:13,875
Man, you are very ungrateful.

849
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:17,208
Anyone else would have fallen at my feet.

850
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,916
- I can't work with him.
- Tariq!

851
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,291
Okay, then let me fall at your feet.

852
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:25,916
- Let go...
- I'll touch your feet.

853
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,083
Cut out this drama!

854
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,208
Come here. Focus. Come on, Tariq.

855
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,708
Come on, Mr. Romeo. Come.

856
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,166
What?

857
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:41,458
Israel can launch
an air raid on Quetta anytime.

858
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:45,291
If we don't get the right location,
this mission will fail.

859
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:49,250
And if you turn out to be right,
then God save us.

860
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:07,250
We'll outmaneuver them.

861
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,666
We'll ask the army directly.

862
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:11,583
Really.

863
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,750
So what was wrong with my idea?

864
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,166
- Let's just kidnap them...
- Wait a minute!

865
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,333
Tariq, what are you thinking?

866
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,708
He must zip his lips.

867
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,791
And you...

868
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:27,833
Hail Lord Shiva.

869
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:24,666
- Sir!
- Sir!

870
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,458
- What's your name?
- Sohail Khan, sir.

871
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:27,416
Umar Sheikh, sir.

872
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:29,958
- Take their names down.
- Yes, sir.

873
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,666
What's wrong, sir? What did we do?

874
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,833
What are you carrying
in this truck? Liquor?

875
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,375
Liquor?

876
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:40,625
No, sir. It's a government order.

877
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,041
These are army jackets, sir.

878
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,208
Open it. Go and check.

879
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:48,625
Sir. We have strict orders.
We can't open this consignment, sir.

880
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:53,666
You follow rules but drive a vehicle
without a number plate?

881
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,416
It might have fallen off on the way, sir.

882
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,458
You're a disgrace to Pakistani Army.

883
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,791
I'll make it sure
you two are court-martialed!

884
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,000
- Court-martialed.
- Sir.

885
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:13,000
Sorry, sir. You can check the consignment.

886
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:14,458
Let's go.

887
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:16,208
Move aside! Sir.

888
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:27,541
Only jackets, sir.

889
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:30,791
Where to?

890
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,708
Sorry, sir, but we can't reveal it.

891
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,833
Kahuta, sir. We're taking these to Kahuta.

892
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,833
Sir, we're running late for the briefing.

893
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,916
- But how dare they talk to their senior...
- Sir, briefing.

894
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,458
Fix the number plate! Scoundrels!

895
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:52,041
- Sir.
- Sir!

896
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,000
Get lost!

897
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,708
Kahuta. It's a small town.

898
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,416
It's just an hour and a half
from Rawalpindi.

899
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,500
A.Q. Khan could commute
easily to that location.

900
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,208
But I wonder.

901
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,458
Why would Pakistan build the facility
so close to the Indian border?

902
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:16,833
Hidden in plain sight.

903
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,625
Ever heard this idiom?

904
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:21,000
I'm suffocating in this uniform.

905
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:22,458
Take this.

906
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:27,083
I must admit, though,
you did look like a major.

907
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,333
How long would it take
to grow your beard back?

908
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:31,916
It was years of hard work.

909
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:37,833
Wait a minute.
Didn't you officiate Mr. Romeo's wedding?

910
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:42,291
If the maulvi is fake,
can the wedding be real?

911
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:48,708
When the couple agrees,
who cares about the maulvi?

912
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,666
- Hail Lord Shiva!
- Hail Lord Shiva!

913
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:59,708
- Nasreen, you...
- Why?

914
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:02,958
Did you think you could get rid of me?

915
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,791
Food is ready. Freshen up and come in.

916
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:11,958
Can you forgive me?

917
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:15,625
The problem
is that I can't stay angry with you.

918
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:26,166
I couldn't help your dad.

919
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:31,500
We can't do anything
to change what God has willed.

920
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:36,500
And the same God has blessed us
with this bundle of joy.

921
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,291
- What happened?
- Give me your hand.

922
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,208
Come on. Sit down. Easy.

923
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,416
Sit down.

924
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,916
- It's...
- Have you thought of a name?

925
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:01,791
Yeah, I do have a name in mind.

926
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:06,500
I'll tell you one day.

927
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:15,791
Have you ever thought
about moving away to live a peaceful life?

928
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,625
I'm always at peace when I'm by your side.

929
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:22,458
But honestly, tell me.

930
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,750
I can live in hell if you are with me.

931
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,166
Nasreen.

932
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:35,000
Let's go. I think the baby is hungry.

933
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,125
You are right, Mr. PM.

934
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:44,916
Pakistani sweets can't compete with this.

935
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,708
Thank you for sending
these gifts from India.

936
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,500
You are most welcome, General.

937
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,583
By the way, how is your health now?

938
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:57,375
Well, my knees are killing me.

939
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:01,458
You should try yoga.
You'll see the difference.

940
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:03,541
<i>Intriguing I must say, Mr. PM.</i>

941
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:07,458
I'll call you from home on Sunday
to discuss this in detail,

942
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,625
if you are free.

943
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:11,333
Sure. Look forward to it.

944
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:14,083
- May God protect you.
- May God protect you.

945
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:19,916
Be seated, please.

946
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:26,125
The PM is a close buddy of mine now.

947
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,875
Try some. It's delicious.

948
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,791
Please.

949
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,458
What were you saying
about the Kahuta facility, Sarfaraz?

950
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:38,583
Sir, we should deploy
anti-aircraft missiles there.

951
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:41,875
Sir, with increased movement,
the enemies might spot us.

952
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:45,750
India can't imagine that we're building
the bomb right under their nose.

953
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:54,000
He's right.

954
01:09:56,375 --> 01:10:00,875
If we must, gun down
a few Indians in Kashmir first.

955
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,416
That will keep them distracted.

956
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,000
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

957
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,083
- Tea, please.
- Sure. Have a seat.

958
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,708
There are many soldiers here.

959
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,666
I counted around 70.

960
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:01,958
Do you know
of any job openings in this area?

961
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:05,333
Maybe some factories looking for workers?

962
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:07,125
No, my friend.

963
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:09,041
The shops you see here,

964
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:11,916
the vegetable vendor,
the snacks shop, the barber shop,

965
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,583
they opened in the last few years

966
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:16,583
when they built the army camp
on the other side of the hills.

967
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,625
Really? How big is the camp?

968
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,791
I've never seen it.

969
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:22,625
They don't allow civilians there.

970
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:25,583
I wonder what they do there.
It stinks all night.

971
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:30,416
Stinks? What could they be making there?

972
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,375
- We want two teas.
- Peace be upon you.

973
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,958
Why don't you ask them directly?

974
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:42,541
If we don't return
in an hour, inform Control.

975
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:49,750
Aslam, if you have
a gun with you, leave it here.

976
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:53,166
I didn't bring a gun here. I'm not a fool.

977
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,250
Let's go.

978
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,375
Look. You're taking a huge risk.

979
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,291
This is the only way
to convince your Sharma.

980
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:06,583
He's not my Sharma. Nonsense.

981
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:09,583
- Come on. Watch your step.
- What have I gotten myself into?

982
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:13,583
Tariq, let's go back, man.

983
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:28,125
Up there?

984
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:31,375
Keep an eye out. I'll be back.

985
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:03,583
Hey!

986
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,666
Hands up!

987
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,541
Please don't shoot, sir!

988
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,958
- Please don't.
- What were you doing?

989
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:16,041
- We lost our way.
- What way?

990
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,000
- Our...
- Speak up!

991
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:20,041
- The way to our village, sir.
- Yes, sir.

992
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:23,583
- Which village?
- You know, the one... Baral.

993
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,041
- Baral.
- Yes.

994
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,375
Turn around.

995
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,250
- Can I put my hands down?
- Shut up!

996
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:38,000
- Not there.
- Don't be smart with me.

997
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:46,416
Move.

998
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,708
- What's going on, sir?
- Be quiet.

999
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,875
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

1000
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:16,791
There it is! We found Kalu.

1001
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:19,833
- Kalu?
- Our Kalu. Here's our Kalu.

1002
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:21,875
- Here's our Kalu.
- Kalu! Yes!

1003
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,291
This idiot was missing since morning, sir.

1004
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:27,000
- We were out looking for him.
- Go on, then.

1005
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,083
Where were you? Did you get anything?

1006
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:33,333
- We did.
- Here.

1007
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:35,666
We found Kalu.

1008
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,583
<i>Don't you guys understand orders?</i>

1009
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:45,166
I didn't expect this from you.

1010
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,541
I'm sorry, Mr. Sharma.

1011
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:49,875
But if A.Q. Khan
was staying in Rawalpindi,

1012
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:52,500
why would they make
a research facility in Quetta?

1013
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:56,291
- Tariq's theory makes sense.
- It's nonsense.

1014
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:59,041
Sir, this is Tariq.

1015
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,833
- Hey.
- I know I'm called the son of a traitor.

1016
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:08,416
But if you don't stand with us today,
your son will be called son of a fool.

1017
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,541
What do you mean?

1018
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:12,625
History won't remember us agents.

1019
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,500
But your name will be on the board.

1020
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:15,916
<i>"Officer Sharma,</i>

1021
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
whose lack of vision made us sit idly

1022
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:20,500
<i>as the country was destroyed."</i>

1023
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,625
<i>Think about it, sir.</i>

1024
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:24,958
If they raid the wrong location,
our mission will be exposed.

1025
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:28,208
It'll be impossible to stop Pakistan
from testing a nuclear bomb.

1026
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:32,750
A nuclear bomb in an unstable country
like Pakistan means destruction for India.

1027
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:38,250
Decide with your head, sir, not emotions.

1028
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,166
- Hello.
- Raman Singh, you're a senior agent.

1029
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:04,375
And you know very well
that without solid physical evidence,

1030
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,000
we can't stop Israel.

1031
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:07,875
Yes.

1032
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:11,666
If Israel attacked Quetta
and it's not the right location,

1033
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:13,750
Pakistan won't spare another minute.

1034
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:16,916
<i>Before we attack Kahuta,</i>

1035
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,666
they will conduct the nuclear test.

1036
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,666
Then they'll aim their guns at Delhi.

1037
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:22,125
Yeah.

1038
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:25,291
Israel will carry out
the air strike in the next 48 hours.

1039
01:16:25,375 --> 01:16:27,666
<i>I will wait for physical evidence.</i>

1040
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:38,625
Sharma has agreed to stay by the phone
for the next 48 hours.

1041
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,583
And he'll wait for our report.

1042
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,583
Israel won't back off
without physical evidence.

1043
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,583
If your theory is proven wrong,
you'll have to go back to India.

1044
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,208
Alone.

1045
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:02,166
I'll go into the facility.

1046
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:05,833
Have you lost it? It's a suicide mission.

1047
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,750
You don't have to atone for your father.

1048
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:10,916
Don't make a big mistake
trying to pay penance.

1049
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,750
We don't keep score with our mothers.

1050
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,791
So why would we with our country?

1051
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:20,500
A country is what its people are.

1052
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:29,125
After Dad's demise,

1053
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,625
many called me the son of a traitor.

1054
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:38,625
They kicked us out of our house.

1055
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:44,333
No one helped my dying mother.

1056
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:45,750
Hate...

1057
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,333
I just hated them.

1058
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,291
But how can I forget the sardar

1059
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,833
who never let me
sleep hungry at the gurudwara?

1060
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:08,041
Or Father Joseph, who fought everyone
to admit me in school?

1061
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,625
And Mr. Kao, who trained me

1062
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,500
to make me capable
of protecting this country?

1063
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,500
We are India.

1064
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:23,125
We don't feed on hatred, but on love.

1065
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:27,333
We won our freedom with love and peace.

1066
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,583
Tell me. Is there another country like us?

1067
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:39,625
I can do anything
to protect a country like that, Raman.

1068
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,291
Anything.

1069
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:45,208
My friend,

1070
01:18:46,416 --> 01:18:48,416
go across the hills.

1071
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,208
We have your back.

1072
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,291
My gun will take care of the soldiers.

1073
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:01,416
<i>We live under your skies</i>

1074
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,375
<i>Nestled in your lap</i>

1075
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,458
<i>We live under your skies</i>

1076
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:11,708
<i>Nestled in your lap</i>

1077
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:14,875
<i>We are the only one in the world who</i>

1078
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:18,750
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1079
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:22,083
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1080
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:24,375
- The plan isn't foolproof.
- We don't have time.

1081
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,875
MY DEAR NASREEN

1082
01:19:32,958 --> 01:19:35,333
<i>We stayed up for you all our lives</i>

1083
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:38,041
<i>Now you must come to put us to sleep</i>

1084
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:41,666
<i>May your head be held high forever
O Motherland</i>

1085
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,000
<i>Even if nobody knows us</i>

1086
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:45,333
GOODBYE NASREEN
AMAN

1087
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,625
<i>Even if nobody knows us</i>

1088
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:52,416
<i>We flow anonymously in the wind</i>

1089
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:55,458
<i>Like fragrance...</i>

1090
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:59,000
<i>We are the only one in the world who</i>

1091
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:02,666
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1092
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:06,708
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1093
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,750
What's wrong, Nasreen?

1094
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:14,958
The baby has not moved since yesterday.

1095
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,666
Everything is fine, Nasreen.

1096
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,250
It happens. You are fine.

1097
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:35,875
Please wait outside.
I'll run the rest of the tests.

1098
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:36,833
Okay.

1099
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,708
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

1100
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:42,958
- Wear this.
- Why do I have to wear this?

1101
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:45,208
They won't let you enter without it.

1102
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:48,500
- Why are you forcing me?
- It's an X-ray machine.

1103
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:52,041
The radiation it emits is so strong
it will remain in your body.

1104
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,458
It can turn you impotent.

1105
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,250
Its light is so dangerous

1106
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:58,958
that we don't touch the machine
without this jacket on.

1107
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,166
It's dangerous.

1108
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,708
Please take Nasreen home.
I'll be back soon.

1109
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:05,750
- But Tariq...
- Just...

1110
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:18,041
- We don't need to enter the facility.
- Why?

1111
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:21,083
Because Kahuta only has one barber shop.

1112
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,000
I can't believe it, man.

1113
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:30,541
You're a genius.

1114
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:41,333
Remember, this is the signal.

1115
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:45,541
What is this?

1116
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,750
Mr. Romeo's signals are also odd like him.

1117
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:50,666
Please come in.

1118
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:09,125
Peace be upon you, sir.

1119
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,083
- Please come.
- Sir.

1120
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:11,791
- I want a shave.
- Sir.

1121
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:15,875
Hey, son, order some tea.

1122
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:29,250
Please come, sir.

1123
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:32,041
Sir, the chair is free now.

1124
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,750
- Well, give me a haircut.
- Please come.

1125
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:38,166
When will he give the signal?

1126
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,291
Chotu!

1127
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:45,625
- Yes, sir?
- Clean this up.

1128
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:46,541
Okay.

1129
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,875
You...

1130
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:12,541
Oh, my God. A fight broke out. Look!

1131
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:15,083
- How dare you tease my sister?
- What's going on?

1132
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:16,916
- How dare you...
- He's hitting him.

1133
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,708
- My sister...
- Get off me!

1134
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:21,458
What's the matter?

1135
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:22,875
Stop them!

1136
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:24,958
- Somebody stop them!
- Stop!

1137
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:26,750
Let go!

1138
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,500
Get off me!

1139
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:30,500
Don't interfere!

1140
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,666
This is my hair. I'm taking it.

1141
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:45,458
But look at the mess here!
Clean it up, Chotu!

1142
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:46,666
You took long enough.

1143
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,458
Hey! Don't mess with me!

1144
01:23:50,541 --> 01:23:52,666
I won't spare you. You scoundrel.

1145
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,208
Hey!

1146
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:58,041
Hey, idiot!

1147
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,000
I won't spare you!

1148
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,958
What next, Tariq?

1149
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:05,000
We need to take it to India.

1150
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:05,916
Lahore?

1151
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,833
Man...

1152
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,958
They have tight security here.

1153
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:21,750
How will you board Samjhauta Express
without your passport and visa?

1154
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,708
No other way to reach India sooner.

1155
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,750
Wagah is just 20 minutes out.

1156
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,666
You'll get caught if you board.

1157
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:33,125
Bhanu Chak village
is between Wagah and Attari.

1158
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,208
Wait for me at that railway crossing.

1159
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:36,291
Are you crazy?

1160
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,791
See you later.

1161
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:46,458
Go to that line.

1162
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,375
- The papers aren't in order.
- They are.

1163
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,375
- No, they aren't.
- Sir, it's all there.

1164
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:54,916
Passport, please.

1165
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:58,208
Lift your arms.

1166
01:25:01,583 --> 01:25:03,500
Hey, don't touch my turban.

1167
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,125
Okay, all right. Go on.

1168
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:24,541
Hey. Please forgive me.

1169
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:47,750
- Step aside.
- Sir.

1170
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:48,916
I said step aside!

1171
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,166
- What's the matter, sir?
- Step aside.

1172
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:53,333
- Go on.
- Sir.

1173
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:55,291
Go on.

1174
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,375
Sir! Please check this also. What's wrong?

1175
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,791
You don't have a turban
in your passport photo.

1176
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:01,833
- Be assured, everything else is there.
- Really?

1177
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:03,583
Take it off.

1178
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:08,208
- What?
- Take your turban off!

1179
01:26:08,291 --> 01:26:09,166
Take the turban off?

1180
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,083
- They want to remove our turbans.
- He's asking us to remove them.

1181
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:13,541
Take off our turbans?

1182
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:15,875
He's asking us to take off our turbans.

1183
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:18,708
He's asking us to remove our turbans.

1184
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:20,666
It's our pride!

1185
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:21,958
Don't forget.

1186
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:24,083
This is also the land of our gurus.

1187
01:26:24,166 --> 01:26:28,208
When I can fight against 1,25 lakhs,
only then will I be called a Sikh.

1188
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:32,958
One who says this is free of miseries.
God is truth.

1189
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:35,750
This train won't leave without my turban.

1190
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:37,375
- Wait a minute.
- Sir.

1191
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:39,666
Do you want to start a war
on the platform?

1192
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:43,125
- Sir, you can go.
- Okay.

1193
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:46,375
Come on, friends. Let's go to Amritsar.

1194
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:49,708
Come on!
The Sikhs of the Lord are victorious!

1195
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:51,500
The Sikhs of the Lord are victorious!

1196
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:52,666
Come on, friends!

1197
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:57,541
Here, son.

1198
01:27:14,916 --> 01:27:16,750
- Is this suitcase yours?
- Yes, sir.

1199
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:26,583
- Whose bag is this?
- It's mine, sir.

1200
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:31,875
- Whose is this? Is this yours?
- Yes, it's mine.

1201
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:44,625
Oh, my god!

1202
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:45,625
Where is it?

1203
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,708
- What, sir?
- My wedding ring.

1204
01:27:47,791 --> 01:27:50,250
- Wedding ring?
- My wedding ring is missing.

1205
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:52,125
Where's my wedding ring? Find it.

1206
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:53,458
Was it expensive?

1207
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:57,083
It wasn't expensive,
but my wife will kill me.

1208
01:27:57,166 --> 01:28:00,500
She will kick me out of the house.

1209
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:04,333
- Faisal, listen carefully.
- Yes, sir.

1210
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:08,291
Coach number seven, seat number seven.
He's a sardar. Arrest him.

1211
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:11,625
- Arrest the sardar in seat number seven.
- Yes, sir.

1212
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:12,958
Oh, my God.

1213
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,458
I've been married for just two years.

1214
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:17,416
Yes, sir. We're looking for him, sir.

1215
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,375
She will kick me out of the house. Stop.

1216
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,833
- Speak.
- Why is it like this, sir?

1217
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:23,166
Nothing. Nothing.

1218
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:46,000
Hey!

1219
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:18,916
Get back inside!

1220
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:34,500
Go up!

1221
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:11,541
Are you okay?

1222
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:14,125
- Yes. Lahore's asset. Quick! Let's go.
- Come on.

1223
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:27,125
Not meds, just prayers.

1224
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:30,625
Sir, coach number seven, seat number 19.

1225
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:33,041
A woman in a blue dress,
wheatish complexion.

1226
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,750
There's a package in her suitcase.
Send it to the lab.

1227
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:36,875
What is in it?

1228
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:39,583
Hair samples of people
working in the Kahuta facility.

1229
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:43,458
If they are making a bomb,
they are exposed to radiation every day.

1230
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:47,291
So the radiation levels
must be high in their hair samples.

1231
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:51,291
You have only 12 hours, sir.
Please don't waste any time.

1232
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:55,875
Amandeep Ajitpal Singh, signing off.

1233
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:12,625
Sodhi, listen carefully.

1234
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:14,750
Wait a minute, please.

1235
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,333
Special Agent Sandeep Singh.
We have to check your bag.

1236
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:20,541
- Check her bag.
- Give it.

1237
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:22,958
What's the matter, sir? My bag...

1238
01:33:41,041 --> 01:33:42,916
- Are the samples here?
- They will be soon.

1239
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,833
The technician should be here early.

1240
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:12,750
Give it to me!

1241
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:15,458
What is it?

1242
01:34:15,541 --> 01:34:18,166
Check for radioactivity.
How long will it take?

1243
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:20,416
Hurry up.

1244
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,083
Radiation markers are very high.

1245
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:44,083
And there are fragments
of highly enriched uranium too.

1246
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:47,500
Only one thing can be made
with this kind of uranium.

1247
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:50,166
Atom bomb.

1248
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:08,750
- Sharma?
- The facility is in Kahuta, not in Quetta.

1249
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:10,500
We have physical evidence.

1250
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,291
- Please stop Israel.
- Shit!

1251
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:17,750
Fifty kilometers from the target.

1252
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,375
Come on, Issac.

1253
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:35,041
Issac, Santosh here.

1254
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,875
Lock in the target.

1255
01:35:42,416 --> 01:35:43,500
T minus 10.

1256
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:48,458
Issac, Mossad.
Get me the air marshal now! Go!

1257
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:51,958
<i>Nine.</i>

1258
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:55,583
<i>Eight.</i>

1259
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:57,166
Seven.

1260
01:36:00,041 --> 01:36:01,333
Abort the mission.

1261
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:02,625
<i>It is not in Quetta.</i>

1262
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:04,916
<i>Four.</i>

1263
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:07,166
<i>Three.</i>

1264
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:11,083
This is the air marshal.
Squadron leader, abort the mission.

1265
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:12,041
<i>Two.</i>

1266
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:15,208
Abort the mission immediately.

1267
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:21,916
Sir, the nuclear facility is close.
The location is Kahuta.

1268
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,333
We must take action, sir.

1269
01:36:23,416 --> 01:36:27,083
You carried out this mission
without my permission.

1270
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:29,708
We'll discuss that later.

1271
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:36,541
Our agents wouldn't have risked
their lives in the field if we had time.

1272
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:38,791
I said I'll think about it.

1273
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:40,958
We need to bomb the Kahuta facility, sir.

1274
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:46,458
I can't push our country into another war
without thinking it through.

1275
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:51,375
Our agents did a fantastic job.

1276
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:53,875
They made the country proud.

1277
01:36:54,666 --> 01:36:57,833
We are indebted to them for their service.

1278
01:37:07,541 --> 01:37:08,458
Sir?

1279
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,666
It was stopped in time, my friend.

1280
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,458
- Okay, sir.
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

1281
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:23,875
I'm sorry for my behavior.

1282
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:28,125
<i>Sitting at this end of the phone,</i>

1283
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:30,583
I considered myself
to be the biggest patriot.

1284
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:34,708
<i>Shouting orders. Swearing.</i>

1285
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:36,125
Calling someone a traitor,

1286
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:39,375
pointing fingers
and that made me a patriot.

1287
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:41,875
<i>But thanks to you, I know from now on.</i>

1288
01:37:43,416 --> 01:37:46,916
Patriotism is not in the blood
but in your soul.

1289
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:51,125
Anyone can talk,
but those who put it into action...

1290
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:55,125
I salute them.

1291
01:37:56,708 --> 01:37:58,625
<i>I don't know about history,</i>

1292
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:04,958
but my children will know
who Amandeep Singh was.

1293
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,291
Son of the nation.

1294
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,041
<i>A true soldier.</i>

1295
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:14,041
No one can take your country from you.

1296
01:38:45,166 --> 01:38:47,541
Connect me to General Zia.

1297
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:51,416
Mr. PM, please listen to me.

1298
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,125
Give me a straight answer.

1299
01:38:53,208 --> 01:38:56,375
Is Pakistan making
a nuclear weapon or not?

1300
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,083
I don't owe you an explanation, Mr. PM.

1301
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:01,291
<i>I'm not obliged.</i>

1302
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:03,291
But you are a friend.

1303
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:05,166
That's why I'm telling you.

1304
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:07,541
Pakistan is not making a nuclear bomb.

1305
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:09,958
Then what's going on in Kahuta?

1306
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:17,875
I don't know
what you are talking about, Mr. PM.

1307
01:39:17,958 --> 01:39:20,250
Don't pretend, General.

1308
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:24,708
We have physical evidence
from the Kahuta nuclear facility.

1309
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,541
<i>I was wrong.</i>

1310
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:29,333
Pakistan can't be trusted.

1311
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:34,625
I hope you remember
that you surrendered in every war.

1312
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:37,333
<i>We won't go easy on you this time.</i>

1313
01:39:37,416 --> 01:39:40,625
Shut down your nuclear facility now!

1314
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:41,708
Mr. PM...

1315
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:47,208
Faisal!

1316
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:51,291
Shut down the nuclear facility.

1317
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:55,541
Sir? We are very close to our goal.

1318
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:59,166
If we stop the work now,
it'll set us back years.

1319
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:01,375
General, we'll soon test it...

1320
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:03,291
Can we test it in the next 15 minutes?

1321
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,875
We need some more time, General, and...

1322
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:11,291
India's fighter jets
can reach Pakistan within 15 minutes.

1323
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:14,875
They'll turn
our 500-million-dollar facility to dust!

1324
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,208
We'll be left picking up pieces.

1325
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:21,666
Shut the facility right now!

1326
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:23,541
Yes, sir.

1327
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:27,250
I'll issue the orders
to shut down the facility.

1328
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,708
How did the Indians find out about Kahuta?

1329
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,875
Only RAW could have done this.

1330
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:36,500
A handful of Indian spies

1331
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:40,250
exposed us in front of the world.

1332
01:40:41,208 --> 01:40:43,833
Pakistan Army, ISI,

1333
01:40:44,791 --> 01:40:45,625
police.

1334
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:49,666
Just a handful of their spies
have exposed us to the world.

1335
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:55,791
Pakistan's dream
has been destroyed, General.

1336
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:58,583
Are we gonna take this lying down?

1337
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:04,833
Tariq, where have you been?

1338
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,833
- Tariq.
- I'm back.

1339
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:12,708
I won't go anywhere now.

1340
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:13,625
What happened?

1341
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:15,500
Is everything all right?

1342
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:19,291
I have some good news, Nasreen.

1343
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,333
We are leaving for Dubai
this Friday night.

1344
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:25,250
Dubai?

1345
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:31,333
Yes, I found a job there.

1346
01:41:31,916 --> 01:41:34,208
- Really? In Dubai?
- Yes.

1347
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:37,375
Thank God.

1348
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:45,500
Nasreen, I've never said...

1349
01:41:47,375 --> 01:41:48,750
this enough to you.

1350
01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:54,500
I love you a lot, Nasreen.

1351
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,458
Tell me something I don't know.

1352
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:24,750
There are RAW agents in Pakistan.

1353
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:29,583
Impossible, sir.

1354
01:42:29,666 --> 01:42:31,333
- Really?
- It's not possible.

1355
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:32,791
It's possible!

1356
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:34,375
Bastards!

1357
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:37,250
They know about Kahuta.

1358
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:43,375
RAW agents are working here

1359
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:46,458
while ISI is twiddling their thumbs.

1360
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:49,875
Find them and finish them.

1361
01:42:50,458 --> 01:42:51,333
Yes.

1362
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:54,208
Or I'll have you skinned in public!

1363
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:57,916
I'll give you 24 hours.

1364
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:59,958
Twenty-four.

1365
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:04,125
I have a bunch of morons
with me in Pakistan!

1366
01:43:05,041 --> 01:43:06,000
Morons!

1367
01:43:08,541 --> 01:43:10,333
Get me the records

1368
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,625
of every call made to India

1369
01:43:16,166 --> 01:43:17,958
in the last two weeks.

1370
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:21,458
You have 12 hours.

1371
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:44,708
- Tickets for Dubai.
- Tickets for Dubai?

1372
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:49,458
Easy. Go easy.

1373
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:09,666
A total of 7,255 calls were made.

1374
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:13,958
Mark the calls made
between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.,

1375
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:16,166
especially from offices and shops.

1376
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,083
- Okay, sir.
- One more thing.

1377
01:44:18,166 --> 01:44:20,125
Concentrate on calls made to Delhi.

1378
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:38,958
- How many people?
- Twenty-one.

1379
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:42,000
Shut down the phone lines.
Start the raids.

1380
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:46,791
If anyone tells you they are orphans,
assume they are RAW agents.

1381
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:49,916
Finish them on the spot.

1382
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,541
But, sir, some of them
might be Pakistani citizens.

1383
01:44:52,625 --> 01:44:54,750
There are martyrs in every war.

1384
01:44:58,875 --> 01:45:00,541
Operators, listen carefully.

1385
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:03,958
We have orders to ban all calls.

1386
01:45:04,041 --> 01:45:06,166
- Do not patch through any calls.
- Yes, sir.

1387
01:45:16,708 --> 01:45:20,083
You are going to a new place,
so far away from all of us.

1388
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:24,500
How will you take care of yourself?

1389
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:26,583
Tariq is with me.

1390
01:45:28,333 --> 01:45:32,416
Don't worry.
I'll send flight tickets for you too.

1391
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,708
We'll miss your biryani after all.

1392
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:38,666
- Won't you invite me to Dubai?
- Can you make biryani?

1393
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:41,791
- Well, I'll learn to.
- Then I'll invite you too.

1394
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:44,125
I wish you all the success.

1395
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:46,875
And may God fulfil all your wishes.

1396
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:48,208
Amen.

1397
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:50,708
My child.

1398
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:52,583
- It's time for Dubai.
- Yeah.

1399
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:54,916
These kids will go to Dubai,

1400
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:58,208
and we'll still be here stitching clothes.

1401
01:46:02,708 --> 01:46:05,250
<i>Don't make a fuss without a reason</i>

1402
01:46:17,333 --> 01:46:18,166
Yes, sir?

1403
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:23,000
- You're shutting shop early today.
- Yeah, I have some snacks left.

1404
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:24,500
I can pack them for you.

1405
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:27,000
- Do you live here?
- Yeah, I have a bed here.

1406
01:46:27,083 --> 01:46:28,791
Do your parents live with you?

1407
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,875
Yeah. Want to meet them?

1408
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:35,500
Mom!

1409
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:37,666
Dad, come outside, please!

1410
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:14,333
Nasreen, I forgot
to say goodbye to some friends.

1411
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:16,500
- I'll go see them.
- Come back soon.

1412
01:47:16,583 --> 01:47:17,625
Yeah.

1413
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,083
{\an8}Victory to thee, O Hanuman!
Ocean of wisdom.

1414
01:48:13,583 --> 01:48:16,958
You're the divine messenger of Lord Rama...

1415
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:19,666
You dispel the darkness...

1416
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:45,791
{\an8}Dad!

1417
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:12,375
<i>No uniform on the body
And no stars on the shoulder</i>

1418
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:17,000
<i>We live under your skies</i>

1419
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:20,541
<i>Our flag will not fly low</i>

1420
01:49:20,625 --> 01:49:24,208
<i>Whenever there's a mention of sacrifice</i>

1421
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:27,458
<i>We will be first in the queue</i>

1422
01:49:27,541 --> 01:49:30,333
<i>No matter if we're on the earth or not</i>

1423
01:49:30,416 --> 01:49:33,875
<i>We will be smiling among stars</i>

1424
01:49:34,375 --> 01:49:36,375
<i>We will be smiling among stars</i>

1425
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:37,291
Tariq!

1426
01:49:40,041 --> 01:49:41,666
Tariq, better take off from here.

1427
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:43,458
What about Aslam?

1428
01:49:44,833 --> 01:49:45,875
I came from his diner.

1429
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:49,458
I could've saved him
if I'd gotten there in time.

1430
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:53,250
Aslam?

1431
01:49:54,375 --> 01:49:57,833
Let's get out of here.
We can cross the border from Fazilka.

1432
01:49:57,916 --> 01:49:59,916
- Nasreen?
- Don't be crazy!

1433
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,166
You have more chances if you escape alive.

1434
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:04,583
For her sake, come with me!

1435
01:50:04,666 --> 01:50:07,541
Deceit leads to the same pain
whether it's India or Pakistan.

1436
01:50:07,625 --> 01:50:11,083
I won't let Nasreen and my baby
go through what I had to.

1437
01:50:12,958 --> 01:50:15,375
- I must go.
- I won't say goodbye.

1438
01:50:15,458 --> 01:50:17,833
I'll see you soon at our home,

1439
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:19,750
in our country.

1440
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,708
May Lord Shiva help you.

1441
01:50:35,708 --> 01:50:37,916
Why the hurry all of a sudden?

1442
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:42,041
Flight time's changed.

1443
01:50:42,125 --> 01:50:44,500
I couldn't even say goodbye.

1444
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:47,458
Drive carefully, man.

1445
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:49,833
Are you okay?

1446
01:50:49,916 --> 01:50:52,666
If you weren't making
those calls to India, who was?

1447
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:56,250
To India? I have no idea, sir.

1448
01:50:57,916 --> 01:51:00,625
Did you give the shop keys
to any employee?

1449
01:51:01,791 --> 01:51:02,750
Keys?

1450
01:51:04,666 --> 01:51:06,291
- Tariq?
- Tariq?

1451
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:16,000
Sir.

1452
01:51:24,041 --> 01:51:28,166
Inform the airport security.
Tariq Hussain and Nasreen.

1453
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:30,375
If their IDs match, detain them.

1454
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:36,166
Yes, sir!

1455
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,666
Here's the airport, sir.

1456
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:40,375
Lower it.

1457
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,833
Come, Nasreen.

1458
01:52:12,666 --> 01:52:14,583
Good evening, sir. Passport, please.

1459
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:21,375
There he is. Stop!

1460
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,541
Thank you, sir. Have a safe flight.

1461
01:52:39,666 --> 01:52:40,708
Come.

1462
01:52:50,041 --> 01:52:51,208
Hands up!

1463
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:53,958
Hands up!

1464
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,291
Hail Lord Shiva.

1465
01:53:13,916 --> 01:53:15,333
Commandos, this way!

1466
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:19,125
Look at this photo carefully.

1467
01:53:20,166 --> 01:53:22,708
Check-in area, waiting area,
just spread out.

1468
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:24,875
Slow down, Tariq. I can't catch my breath.

1469
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,875
We are at the security gate.

1470
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:28,583
You guys check the left side.

1471
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:46,625
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1472
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:19,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1473
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:21,083
- Come on.
- Please come forward.

1474
01:54:26,833 --> 01:54:28,250
- Have you seen him?
- Come on.

1475
01:54:28,333 --> 01:54:29,583
Show me the name entries.

1476
01:54:29,666 --> 01:54:30,916
- No, sir.
- No.

1477
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,458
Have you seen him?

1478
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:34,875
Yes, sir. He just went in.

1479
01:54:35,833 --> 01:54:37,083
Come on! Quick!

1480
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,916
He has cleared immigration.

1481
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:43,500
- Tariq...
- Just a few more steps.

1482
01:54:45,833 --> 01:54:48,166
You are holding my hand really tight.

1483
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:49,083
Let go!

1484
01:54:51,041 --> 01:54:54,333
Something's off. What are you doing?

1485
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:56,833
Sorry. Come on. Sit here.

1486
01:54:56,916 --> 01:54:58,250
Easy. Sit.

1487
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:01,541
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1488
01:55:02,291 --> 01:55:03,958
But what's wrong with you?

1489
01:55:04,666 --> 01:55:08,083
It feels like we are running from someone.

1490
01:55:11,625 --> 01:55:12,625
What's wrong?

1491
01:55:14,666 --> 01:55:18,416
Tariq.

1492
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,208
What's wrong?

1493
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:21,833
Tell me.

1494
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:25,208
Come on. Tell me.

1495
01:55:27,875 --> 01:55:29,666
You are tired.

1496
01:55:30,458 --> 01:55:32,000
I'll get a wheelchair for you.

1497
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,875
Come here. Sit on this.

1498
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:43,333
Come.

1499
01:55:44,625 --> 01:55:45,625
Be careful.

1500
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:53,208
We don't have adjoining
seats on the flight.

1501
01:55:55,333 --> 01:55:56,333
But don't worry.

1502
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,666
You seem more worried than me.

1503
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:07,375
I have been trying to tell you something.

1504
01:56:11,916 --> 01:56:13,083
Aman.

1505
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:16,291
That's the name I have for our baby.

1506
01:56:17,708 --> 01:56:18,750
Do you like it?

1507
01:56:20,125 --> 01:56:21,041
Amazing.

1508
01:56:22,083 --> 01:56:23,375
It's a beautiful name.

1509
01:56:24,041 --> 01:56:27,291
Whether we have a boy or a girl,
it will work for both.

1510
01:56:30,375 --> 01:56:31,375
Aman.

1511
01:56:34,083 --> 01:56:35,833
There's some money in your bag.

1512
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,375
Take care.

1513
01:56:38,583 --> 01:56:41,166
You're talking
as if you're going somewhere else.

1514
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,791
There is a separate queue for women here.

1515
01:56:49,458 --> 01:56:51,208
A staff member will take you.

1516
01:56:51,291 --> 01:56:52,375
How about you?

1517
01:56:55,333 --> 01:56:56,875
I'll meet you on the other side.

1518
01:57:05,541 --> 01:57:09,166
<i>My Lord knows</i>

1519
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:12,000
<i>My Lord knows</i>

1520
01:57:12,083 --> 01:57:17,833
<i>How I love you</i>

1521
01:57:17,916 --> 01:57:21,083
<i>My Lord knows</i>

1522
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:24,291
<i>My Lord knows</i>

1523
01:57:24,375 --> 01:57:30,083
<i>How I love you</i>

1524
01:57:32,166 --> 01:57:33,791
Do you have the address?

1525
01:57:37,916 --> 01:57:39,000
Passport and ticket, ma'am.

1526
01:57:46,083 --> 01:57:47,458
Stop!

1527
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:11,666
Long live India!

1528
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:20,541
Come with me, quickly.

1529
01:58:23,916 --> 01:58:27,458
- What happened, sir?
- Nothing. Some security matter it seems.

1530
01:58:53,125 --> 01:58:54,166
Hey!

1531
01:59:22,791 --> 01:59:24,291
Ma'am, please mind your head.

1532
01:59:25,875 --> 01:59:27,125
Please have a seat.

1533
02:00:03,625 --> 02:00:04,625
Back off!

1534
02:00:06,666 --> 02:00:08,208
I said back off!

1535
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:10,416
Surrender while you still can!

1536
02:00:12,541 --> 02:00:13,500
Shoot!

1537
02:00:14,666 --> 02:00:16,083
Sir, he's got our man.

1538
02:00:17,666 --> 02:00:18,958
Shoot!

1539
02:00:31,041 --> 02:00:32,708
<i>Beloved</i>

1540
02:00:32,791 --> 02:00:38,291
<i>Forgive me</i>

1541
02:00:39,541 --> 02:00:43,125
<i>That I left you</i>

1542
02:00:43,208 --> 02:00:47,041
<i>In between, on the way</i>

1543
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:55,166
<i>So as not to break the promise
I made to my mother</i>

1544
02:00:55,833 --> 02:01:02,833
<i>I broke the promise I made to you</i>

1545
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:10,041
<i>I broke the promise I made to you</i>

1546
02:01:20,166 --> 02:01:22,166
Go, Nasreen.

1547
02:01:23,583 --> 02:01:24,416
Go.

1548
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:26,916
<i>It is you who is the one</i>

1549
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,750
<i>But what can we do</i>

1550
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:34,958
<i>We call India our life</i>

1551
02:01:35,875 --> 02:01:41,041
<i>We are the only one in the world who</i>

1552
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:45,000
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1553
02:01:45,083 --> 02:01:47,291
May God protect you, Nasreen.

1554
02:01:47,375 --> 02:01:51,458
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1555
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:16,791
{\an8}<i>Welcome to Dubai International Airport.</i>

1556
02:02:37,416 --> 02:02:38,458
Tariq?

1557
02:02:41,833 --> 02:02:45,750
My name is Kao. I'm Tariq's friend.

1558
02:02:45,833 --> 02:02:47,208
Where is Tariq?

1559
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:58,250
"My dear Nasreen,
if Mr. Kao is reading this letter to you,

1560
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:01,708
then I'm not in this world anymore."

1561
02:03:04,458 --> 02:03:09,625
<i>Nasreen, you always said
that I keep secrets.</i>

1562
02:03:10,625 --> 02:03:12,250
<i>I am guilty of that.</i>

1563
02:03:13,125 --> 02:03:15,916
<i>I've always loved you with all my heart.</i>

1564
02:03:16,708 --> 02:03:21,458
<i>But bound by my duty,
I had to keep some secrets from you.</i>

1565
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:24,166
<i>Today, I want to tell you everything.</i>

1566
02:03:24,916 --> 02:03:29,583
<i>My name is Amandeep Singh,
and I'm an Indian.</i>

1567
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:38,833
<i>Because of the sacrifice of Indian agents,</i>

1568
02:03:38,916 --> 02:03:42,625
<i>the secret nuclear facility in Kahuta
was exposed to the world.</i>

1569
02:03:43,708 --> 02:03:47,291
{\an8}<i>Yet, Zia kept denying this truth.</i>

1570
02:03:48,416 --> 02:03:51,333
{\an8}<i>Why should Pakistan
indulge in the proliferation</i>

1571
02:03:51,416 --> 02:03:54,833
<i>against which Pakistan,
on principles, is opposed to?</i>

1572
02:03:54,916 --> 02:03:57,875
<i>Because we have no intentions
of developing a nuclear device.</i>

1573
02:03:57,958 --> 02:03:59,541
<i>Sir, we are honorable people.</i>

1574
02:04:01,125 --> 02:04:03,041
{\an8}<i>But the truth can't be kept under wraps.</i>

1575
02:04:03,125 --> 02:04:05,958
{\an8}<i>In 2004, A.Q. Khan admitted</i>

1576
02:04:06,041 --> 02:04:09,875
<i>that Pakistan had sold nuclear technology</i>

1577
02:04:09,958 --> 02:04:12,208
<i>to rogue nations
like North Korea and Iran.</i>

1578
02:04:12,291 --> 02:04:16,083
<i>We should... I would be worried
more about what you say about me.</i>

1579
02:04:16,166 --> 02:04:19,000
<i>Not what Bush says or Dick Cheney says.</i>

1580
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:20,875
<i>I... don't care.</i>

1581
02:04:20,958 --> 02:04:23,916
<i>Pakistan couldn't conduct
nuclear tests for the next 20 years.</i>

1582
02:04:24,916 --> 02:04:25,833
{\an8}<i>In 1998...</i>

1583
02:04:25,916 --> 02:04:29,875
{\an8}<i>under the leadership
of PM Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee,</i>

1584
02:04:29,958 --> 02:04:32,291
<i>India conducted its second nuclear test.</i>

1585
02:04:32,375 --> 02:04:36,083
<i>And it became the biggest nuclear power
of the subcontinent.</i>

1586
02:04:39,083 --> 02:04:41,083
<i>It's not the wind
that holds our tricolor high.</i>

1587
02:04:41,666 --> 02:04:43,666
<i>It's the last breath of our martyrs.</i>

1588
02:04:56,666 --> 02:05:00,166
<i>We live under your skies</i>

1589
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:03,166
<i>Nestled in your lap</i>

1590
02:05:03,791 --> 02:05:07,166
<i>We live under your skies</i>

1591
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:10,166
<i>Nestled in your lap</i>

1592
02:05:10,666 --> 02:05:14,291
<i>We are the only one in the world who</i>

1593
02:05:14,375 --> 02:05:17,666
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1594
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:21,291
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1595
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:38,875
<i>We stayed up for you all our lives</i>

1596
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:42,416
<i>Now you must come to put us to sleep</i>

1597
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:45,583
<i>May your head be held high forever
O Motherland</i>

1598
02:05:45,666 --> 02:05:49,166
<i>Even if nobody knows us</i>

1599
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:53,166
<i>We stayed up for you all our lives</i>

1600
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:56,541
<i>Now you must come to put us to sleep</i>

1601
02:05:56,625 --> 02:05:59,875
<i>May your head be held high forever
O Motherland</i>

1602
02:05:59,958 --> 02:06:03,166
<i>Even if nobody knows us</i>

1603
02:06:03,250 --> 02:06:06,625
<i>Even if nobody knows us</i>

1604
02:06:06,708 --> 02:06:10,666
<i>We flow anonymously in the wind</i>

1605
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:13,625
<i>Like fragrance...</i>

1606
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:17,625
<i>We flow anonymously in the wind</i>

1607
02:06:17,708 --> 02:06:21,166
<i>Like fragrance...</i>

1608
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:24,833
<i>We are the only one in the world who</i>

1609
02:06:24,916 --> 02:06:28,250
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1610
02:06:28,333 --> 02:06:31,958
<i>Call our soil "Mother"</i>

1611
02:07:03,583 --> 02:07:09,458
<i>No uniform on the body
And no stars on the shoulder</i>

1612
02:07:10,625 --> 02:07:14,291
<i>No uniform on the body
And no stars on the shoulder</i>

1613
02:07:14,375 --> 02:07:17,791
<i>Our flag will not fly low</i>

1614
02:07:17,875 --> 02:07:21,375
<i>Whenever there's a mention of sacrifice</i>

1615
02:07:21,458 --> 02:07:24,833
<i>We will be first in the queue</i>

1616
02:07:24,916 --> 02:07:27,875
<i>No matter if we're on the earth or not</i>

1617
02:07:27,958 --> 02:07:31,041
<i>We will be smiling among stars</i>

1618
02:07:31,833 --> 02:07:34,791
<i>We will be smiling among stars</i>

1619
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:38,916
<i>Let the garden that we call India</i>

1620
02:07:39,041 --> 02:07:41,875
<i>Keep flowering</i>

1621
02:07:42,458 --> 02:07:46,166
