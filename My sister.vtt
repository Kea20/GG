They all were independent,
they lived alone.


75

No history of domestic
violence or being stalked.


76
00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.068
So what's the connection?

77
00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:44.507
If you just take a look
at their hair color,


78
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.785
Their eyes, their
facial structure even.


79
00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:49.412
I mean, these women could
practically be related.


80
00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:52.540
I think we have a serial
killer on our hands.


81
00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:55.627
Without bodies,
that's a big leap,


82
00:03:55.854 --> 00:03:58.129
To say that this is
the work of one man.


83
00:03:58.356 --> 00:03:59.442
I know.

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:01.633
That's why I wanna
look into it some more.


85
00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:05.303
I need to interview every
person these women knew.


86
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.263
And I need this paper's
resources to do it.

head up local news,

corner column.

00:04:15.874 --> 00:04:17.557
Right.

is why this is important.

these women disappeared from.

this killer's path.

It's been one year since
the last disappearance,


98
00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:42.485

journalist, mad die.

something more than hair color.

have gotten killed.

00:07:44.766 --> 00:07:46.524
Especially if you want
something from me.


185
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.655
I know that you guys
have been through a lot.


186
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:51.604
In your lives.

187
00:07:51.698 --> 00:07:52.772
She didn't say anything,

188
00:07:52.866 --> 00:07:54.418
I just do a deep dive
on all my tenants.


189
00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:58.514
But I do need my rent asap.

190
00:07:58.538 --> 00:07:59.370
Yeah, I know.

191
00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:00.705
We'll get it to you, okay.

192
00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:02.949
Bye.

193
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.596
[dramatic music]

194
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.627
That guy is such a creep.

195
00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:10.715
I really don't know why you
stay here and put up with that.


196
00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:13.384
Mom always said, "catch
more flies with honey."


197
00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.511
Yeah, well, you catch
a-hole flies too.


198
00:08:17.282 --> 00:08:19.535
You think it was Todd
that broke in here?


199
00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:21.893
Maddie, he is a key, why would
he go through the window?


200
00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:23.205
I don't know.

201
00:08:23.229 --> 00:08:24.989
But I think maybe you
should move in with me.


202
00:08:25.123 --> 00:08:26.898
Until he gets some
bars on these windows.


203
00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:28.049
No, thank you.

204
00:08:28.142 --> 00:08:29.625
But I need space for work.

205
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.477
My place has plenty of space.

206
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:34.980
And maybe a change of scenery
will help unblock you.


207
00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:36.794
I could use the company.

208
00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:38.076
Do me a favor, come on.

209
00:08:39.562 --> 00:08:41.891
[gentle music]

210
00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:44.301
Do you promise not to mother me?

211
00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:45.325
No.

212
00:08:46.144 --> 00:08:47.144
Fine, yeah.

213
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.420
Thank you.

214
00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:50.496
[gentle music]

215
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.924
[insects chirping]

216
00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:55.343
I'm really glad we went
today to the cemetery.


217
00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:57.779
Didn't realize how lucky I am.

218
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:04.418
So, you know that article
I pitched my editor?


219
00:09:04.512 --> 00:09:06.582
Yeah, about the disappearances?

220
00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:07.772
Yeah.

221
00:09:07.923 --> 00:09:09.515
Well, I didn't
wanna tell you this.


222
00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:11.662
Because I didn't
want you to worry,


223
00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:14.498
But I think that
whoever's responsible.


224
00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:16.781
Might be here in Atlanta.

225
00:09:17.008 --> 00:09:19.002
Look, you fit the
profile, right,


226
00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:20.910
Late 20s, blonde, single.

227
00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:26.791
No, no, I'm not gonna
let you do this.


228
00:09:27.018 --> 00:09:27.941
Do what?

229
00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:29.127
I'm not gonna live my life.

230
00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:31.462
Thinking every person
I meet is a monster.


231
00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:36.445
Livy, you have to understand,
I can't lose you too.


232
00:09:36.469 --> 00:09:38.469
You are not going to lose me.

233
00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:43.619
Have you ever thought about
taking a self-defense class?


234
00:09:43.643 --> 00:09:45.696
I already know to stick my
fingers in someone's eyes.


235
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.124
And then throw a
knee in their crotch.


236
00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:50.033
There's a lot more than that.

237
00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:51.482
Please, for me.

238
00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:54.968
Can we just take a
couple of classes?


239
00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.380
I promise it'll be painless.

240
00:09:57.473 --> 00:09:58.881
Of course.

241
00:09:58.974 --> 00:09:59.802
Thank you.

242
00:09:59.826 --> 00:10:01.637
[gentle music]

243
00:10:01.661 --> 00:10:05.812
[haden] welcome to women's
self-defense intensive.


244
00:10:05.907 --> 00:10:08.749
My name is haden, and I'll be
your self defense instructor.


245
00:10:10.395 --> 00:10:13.223
Now, in this class, you're
gonna learn verbal strategies,


246
00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:16.823
Situational awareness,
assault prevention.


247
00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:19.993
And physical assailant defense.

248
00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:24.740
I'm gonna arm you with the
tools to fight back, okay.


249
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.500
All right, what is your name?

250
00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:27.852
Right here in front.

251
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.740
Olivia.

252
00:10:29.764 --> 00:10:31.000
Olivia, great, can you come
on up and help me please?


253
00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:32.242
Go on.

254
00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:33.024
[haden] come on, I'm
not gonna hurt you.


255
00:10:33.251 --> 00:10:34.251
Okay.

256
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.862
All right, Olivia,

257
00:10:39.924 --> 00:10:40.918
Have you ever taken a
self defense class before?


258
00:10:40.942 --> 00:10:42.258
- Nope.
- Okay.


259
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:43.871
Well, why did you
sign up for my class?


260
00:10:44.687 --> 00:10:46.853
My sister, mad die, wanted me to.

261
00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:48.706
I had a break in.

262
00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:49.540
Oh, okay.

263
00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:51.191
Well go on.

264
00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:53.430
Look, we need to be more open
about these experiences, okay.


265
00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:56.697
Because you could also help
somebody here in this classroom.


266
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:57.791
By sharing with us.

267
00:10:59.627 --> 00:11:02.720
Well, I had someone
break into my house,


268
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.705
And I managed to lock
myself in the bathroom,


269
00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:06.966
So he actually didn't touch me.

270
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.208
Well, that's good.

271
00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:10.039
But what if you did get in,

272
00:11:10.063 --> 00:11:11.562
What would you have
been able to do?


273
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.644
Rule number one, when
there is a threat,


274
00:11:18.738 --> 00:11:21.146
You do not hesitate, you act.

275
00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:24.817
You strike, you strike
first and you strike hard.


276
00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:26.911
You do not let them
take the advantage.


277
00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:29.989
And then you do whatever
it is that you have to do.


278
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:31.156
To get away.

279
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:33.751
You pull hair, you gouge eyes.

280
00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.495
And as much as it
pains me to say this,


281
00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:37.997
You kick him in
the crotch, okay.


282
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:39.648
[all laughing]

283
00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:40.499
All right, well,
we're actually gonna.


284
00:11:40.593 --> 00:11:42.151
Do a little demonstration here,

285
00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:44.564
And Olivia is going to actually
knee me in the groin, okay.


286
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.766
All right, don't
worry, I have some pads.


287
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.510
And I'm a professional,
so, I've done this before.


288
00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:52.581
It's okay.

289
00:11:52.605 --> 00:11:53.824
Now, I can't put
my arm around you,


290
00:11:53.848 --> 00:11:55.180
So you put yours around me.

291
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:56.941
Just go ahead,
put 'em around me.


292
00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.254
There you go.

293
00:11:58.278 --> 00:12:00.019
And I'm gonna just hold
my hands down here.


294
00:12:00.113 --> 00:12:01.113
- Okay.
- All right.


295
00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:02.925
Look at me.

296
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:05.928
When you're ready, just knee
him in the crotch, okay.


297
00:12:05.952 --> 00:12:07.504
On you, ready?

298
00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:09.098
Go.

299
00:12:09.122 --> 00:12:10.788
Again.

300
00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.123
That's it, go.

301
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.532
All right, one more.

302
00:12:13.626 --> 00:12:14.792
Nice, all right.

303
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:15.684
[all applauding]

304
00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:16.847
Great job.

305
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:17.944
Let's give Olivia a hand.

306
00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:19.108
Okay, you can have a seat.

307
00:12:19.132 --> 00:12:20.183
Okay.

308
00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:21.259
We'll have a next volunteer.

309
00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:22.778
Yeah, thank you.

310
00:12:22.802 --> 00:12:24.710
[gentle music]

311
00:12:24.862 --> 00:12:25.970
Okay, like we just did.

312
00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:27.696
[gentle music]

313
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.670
[mad die] geez, you're
really getting into this.


314
00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:30.867
I know.

315
00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:33.319
I've got some new
ideas for the book too.


316
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:34.553
Well, look at that.

317
00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:35.962
You've been inspired.

318
00:12:36.057 --> 00:12:37.706
Just like I said.

319
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.295
I don't know, I think
it's just the adrenaline.


320
00:12:39.319 --> 00:12:41.538
You gotta gimme
some pointers now.


321
00:12:41.562 --> 00:12:42.562
[Olivia] maybe.

322
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.157
You like him?

323
00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:47.140
[Olivia] who?

324
00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.068
Haden, from self defense.

325
00:12:49.162 --> 00:12:50.903
He is very attractive, mad die.

326
00:12:51.055 --> 00:12:53.309
He's our instructor, Olivia.

327
00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:56.167
Yeah, but even if he wasn't
and I met him out in the wild,


328
00:12:56.394 --> 00:12:58.586
You'd still find something
wrong with him, right?


329
00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.985
Well, just want you to
be careful, that's all.


330
00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:04.009
Yeah.

331
00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:06.010
I know.

332
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.763
[dramatic music]

333
00:13:10.683 --> 00:13:13.517
[insects chirping]

334
00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:16.020
[dramatic music]

335
00:13:27.258 --> 00:13:29.775
[cellphone beeping]

336
00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:32.536
[dramatic music]

337
00:13:41.714 --> 00:13:42.621
[car engines revving]

338
00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:43.956
[knocking on door]

339
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.050
[kyle] yeah, come in.

340
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:47.218
Hey, kyle.

341
00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:48.702
Hey, mad die.

342
00:13:48.796 --> 00:13:50.440
I'm not bothering you, am I?

343
00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:52.798
No, you just, come on in.

344
00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:55.893
<i>Mi casa</i> is your casa too.

345
00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:56.952
There you go.

346
00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.063
Sorry about the... Everything.

347
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.900
What's up?

348
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:06.048
So, I know Rachel didn't
approve the article,


349
00:14:06.072 --> 00:14:08.739
But I'm not giving up.

350
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.891
Good for you.

351
00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:11.985
What do you need from me?

352
00:14:12.136 --> 00:14:13.889
Really?

353
00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:15.282
I mean, I know without her
green lighting something,


354
00:14:15.306 --> 00:14:17.415
It could kinda put you
in an awkward position.


355
00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:20.137
Well, the fact is, this
story could save a life.


356
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:22.753
Besides, I get a lunch hour.

357
00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:24.146
Awesome, okay.

358
00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:26.999
So, I need some
background on two names.


359
00:14:27.093 --> 00:14:30.169
The first one is Todd young,
he is a local property manager.


360
00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:31.487
From the lake wood area.

361
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.100
I need a list of all
of his properties.


362
00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:35.415
To see if they

haden Carmichael.

I know about him.

Okay.

369

a pretty wide net.

Yeah, I mean, nature
gave me this gift,


543
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.781
And so it's my responsibility.

544
00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:14.057
[laughing]

545
00:22:14.284 --> 00:22:15.284
Isn't that amazing?

546
00:22:16.303 --> 00:22:16.968
- Well.
- Yeah.


547
00:22:17.062 --> 00:22:18.378
It's late.

548
00:22:18.472 --> 00:22:19.541
But thank you for
letting me clean up.


549
00:22:19.565 --> 00:22:21.456
Yeah, of course.

550
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:24.401
I had incredible time
with you tonight.


551
00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:27.905
And thank you, mad die,

552
00:22:28.132 --> 00:22:31.033
For letting me spend time
with your amazing sister.


553
00:22:32.152 --> 00:22:33.152
You're welcome.

554
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:36.304
[dramatic music]

555
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:37.563
Goodnight.

556
00:22:37.658 --> 00:22:38.999
[Olivia] night.

557
00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:45.405
You went hiking in the
middle of the night.


558
00:22:45.499 --> 00:22:46.256
With a man you hardly know.

559
00:22:46.483 --> 00:22:47.499
I know.

560
00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:49.312
It was so exhilarating.

561
00:22:49.336 --> 00:22:50.502
What did I tell you, Olivia?

562
00:22:50.596 --> 00:22:52.482
No hikes, no cruises.

563
00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:53.655
It's not like I disappeared.

564
00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:55.744
He watched over me
the entire time.


565
00:22:55.768 --> 00:22:57.412
And he didn't even
try to kiss me.


566
00:22:57.436 --> 00:22:59.603
He was the perfect gentleman.

567
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.772
Yeah, I bet.

568
00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:04.849
[cellphone beeping]

569
00:23:04.944 --> 00:23:07.110
And how was your date?

570
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.924
I didn't have a date.

571
00:23:08.948 --> 00:23:09.613
[cellphone beeping]

572
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.264
Oh, really?

573
00:23:11.358 --> 00:23:15.360
Yeah, I guess they don't call
it a date on seek and date.Com.


574
00:23:15.512 --> 00:23:16.286
Who's jack?

575
00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:17.674
[gentle music]

576
00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:19.258
Stop trying to change
the subject, okay.


577
00:23:23.353 --> 00:23:24.536
Are you gonna see him again?

578
00:23:24.688 --> 00:23:26.797
If he asks, definitely.

579
00:23:27.024 --> 00:23:28.966
Well, did you find out
anything about him,


580
00:23:29.193 --> 00:23:31.354
Where he came from, does
he have family, friends?


581
00:23:31.378 --> 00:23:33.361
Because I'd like to know.

582
00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.450
Well, what did you
find out about jack?


583
00:23:35.474 --> 00:23:36.881
Does he have friends, family?

584
00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:38.550
I'd like to know.

585
00:23:38.644 --> 00:23:39.718
[dramatic music]

586
00:23:39.812 --> 00:23:40.812
Goodnight.

587
00:23:40.962 --> 00:23:43.647
[dramatic music]

588
00:23:46.727 --> 00:23:48.043
[mad die] I need to know.

589
00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:48.964
What you found out
about the truck.


590
00:23:48.988 --> 00:23:50.654
[kyle] not much.

591
00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:53.398
I sent in a request for
any violations against it,


592
00:23:53.492 --> 00:23:57.736
But there's only so much I
can do with just a truck.


593
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.716
What else do you need?

594
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.499
Passport, driver's
license, credit card,


595
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.576
Anything with his
full name on it?


596
00:24:04.728 --> 00:24:06.889
Sure, I think I can do that.

597
00:24:06.913 --> 00:24:09.748
Oh, do you want to know.

598
00:24:09.842 --> 00:24:13.677
What I found out about your
sister's landlord, Todd young?


599
00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:15.512
Of course.

600
00:24:15.739 --> 00:24:18.849
Well, besides lake wood, he
has properties all over,


601
00:24:19.076 --> 00:24:20.350
Including perryman.

602
00:24:21.928 --> 00:24:22.831
Ho warden?

603
00:24:22.855 --> 00:24:25.022
Not that's in the public record.

604
00:24:25.173 --> 00:24:27.599
Well, two outta three ain't bad,

605
00:24:27.693 --> 00:24:29.109
But that's nothing definitive.

606
00:24:30.512 --> 00:24:32.195
[dramatic music]

607
00:24:32.422 --> 00:24:33.508
What is it?

608
00:24:33.532 --> 00:24:36.424
Well, both these men
are in my sister's life,


609
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:37.587
And I don't know
how to protect her,


610
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:39.036
Other than locking her away.

611
00:24:39.187 --> 00:24:42.539
And she probably wouldn't
like that very much, so.


612
00:24:45.544 --> 00:24:49.546
We're gonna figure this out,
no matter what it takes.


613
00:24:49.773 --> 00:24:50.773
Yeah.

614
00:24:51.775 --> 00:24:53.550
You're the best, kyle,
thank you, really.


615
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.471
[dramatic music]

616
00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:08.973
Yeah, Jeff, you're killing it.

617
00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:10.458
Again, good.

618
00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:11.552
Five more.

619
00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:13.645
Good, good, good form.

620
00:25:13.739 --> 00:25:15.383
Nice and slow on the way down.

621
00:25:15.407 --> 00:25:16.407
Good.

622
00:25:18.243 --> 00:25:19.651
Again.

623
00:25:19.745 --> 00:25:20.985
Nice.

624
00:25:21.138 --> 00:25:22.370
Pull through your lats here.

625
00:25:23.749 --> 00:25:24.749
Nice work, nice work.

626
00:25:26.143 --> 00:25:27.751
Keep going, keep going.

627
00:25:27.978 --> 00:25:28.660
Nice.

628
00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:30.069
[dramatic music]

629
00:25:30.163 --> 00:25:33.256
Extend it all the
way out, back, good.


630
00:25:33.408 --> 00:25:34.666
Nice work, Jeff.

631
00:25:34.818 --> 00:25:35.818
Go, go.

632
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.515
Add more, come on, come on.

633
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:48.438
[dramatic music]

634
00:26:02.012 --> 00:26:03.027
[telephone ringing]

635
00:26:03.122 --> 00:26:04.846
All right, listen.

636
00:26:04.939 --> 00:26:06.698
You switch over to
the left side, okay.


637
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:07.958
I'm gonna go answer that.

638
00:26:08.185 --> 00:26:11.013
[telephone ringing]

639
00:26:11.037 --> 00:26:12.612
Yeah, I'll be right back.

640
00:26:12.706 --> 00:26:15.632
[telephone ringing]

641
00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:18.635
Maddie.

642
00:26:18.862 --> 00:26:19.862
Oh, hey.

643
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:23.882
What are you doing in here?

644
00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:27.385
I just slipped in.

645
00:26:27.479 --> 00:26:29.962
I didn't wanna interrupt you.

646
00:26:30.056 --> 00:26:31.773
Yeah, well, you kinda did.

647
00:26:33.377 --> 00:26:36.038
Oh, well, I thought I
left a sweatshirt here.


648
00:26:36.062 --> 00:26:40.877
After last time and thought,
maybe it was in lost and found.


649
00:26:40.901 --> 00:26:43.805
Yeah, well, that's
not the lost and found.


650
00:26:43.829 --> 00:26:46.288
And nothing was left
after the last class.


651
00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:49.416
Oh shoot.

652
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:52.722
It was my favorite.

653
00:26:52.746 --> 00:26:54.482
I always do that.

654
00:26:54.506 --> 00:26:55.506
Yeah.

655
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.061
Well, I'm sorry again
for the interruption,


656
00:26:59.085 --> 00:27:03.805
And I will see you later.

657
00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:07.809
[dramatic music]

658
00:27:10.522 --> 00:27:13.001
And so then she pops
out from the back seat.


659
00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:14.025
Where she'd been hiding.

660
00:27:14.084 --> 00:27:14.933
What?

661
00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:17.172
And says, "this
isn't the movies."


662
00:27:17.196 --> 00:27:21.918
No, we can laugh about it
now, but I loved that boy.


663
00:27:21.942 --> 00:27:23.533
Oh god.

664
00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:25.680
I just, I don't even know.

665
00:27:25.704 --> 00:27:27.089
There's so much that
I wanna say right now,


666
00:27:27.113 --> 00:27:28.424
But I just can't.

667
00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:29.497
No, what is it?

668
00:27:31.435 --> 00:27:33.930
No, no, no, I am not gonna
add some family drama.


669
00:27:33.954 --> 00:27:35.194
Between you and your sister.

670
00:27:35.288 --> 00:27:37.772
No, I am giving you a pass.

671
00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.101
That's why I told
you that story,


672
00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:40.884
I know she can be difficult.

673
00:27:41.111 --> 00:27:42.111
Okay.

674
00:27:43.296 --> 00:27:45.463
You're not gonna like it.

675
00:27:45.557 --> 00:27:48.516
I ran into your sister today.

676
00:27:49.877 --> 00:27:52.062
Yeah, at the
studio, in the back.


677
00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:53.208
[Olivia] what?

678
00:27:53.232 --> 00:27:56.733
Like rummaging through my stuff.

679
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.622
And she gave me some
like ridiculous story.


680
00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:01.646
That she like lost a
hoodie or something.


681
00:28:01.798 --> 00:28:03.158
And at the time I
thought, oh okay,


682
00:28:03.224 --> 00:28:05.817
But now that you tell me
this, I realized, no, no,


683
00:28:05.969 --> 00:28:07.535
She does this to everybody.

684
00:28:09.806 --> 00:28:11.915
I'm sorry, that she's
checking on you like that.


685
00:28:13.994 --> 00:28:15.377
There's no excuse, but she...

686
00:28:17.756 --> 00:28:18.756
What?

687
00:28:20.592 --> 00:28:21.592
There's a history.

688
00:28:22.577 --> 00:28:23.577
A history?

689
00:28:25.338 --> 00:28:27.984
Can't believe I'm telling
you this right now.


690
00:28:28.008 --> 00:28:30.934
Maddie and I used to
have a sister, Abigail.


691
00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:32.085
Had a sister?

692
00:28:34.773 --> 00:28:36.773
When we were younger,

693
00:28:36.924 --> 00:28:39.609
Our mom used to leave us
with her a lot to watch her.


694
00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:42.186
We'd, you know, go
to the playground.


695
00:28:42.281 --> 00:28:46.007
Maddie wandered away for a
second and I wasn't looking.


696
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.620
And then, you know,
she was just gone.


697
00:28:52.273 --> 00:28:53.865
[gentle music]

698
00:28:53.959 --> 00:28:55.678
What do you mean "gone"?

699
00:28:55.702 --> 00:28:57.179
Someone took her.

700
00:28:57.203 --> 00:28:59.871
But we go to her
grave every year.


701
00:29:00.023 --> 00:29:01.517
And mad die and I just went,

702
00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:05.802
So I'm sure she's just a little
extra protective right now.


703
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:06.803
[gentle music]

704
00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:07.954
I'm so sorry.

705
00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:10.765
I know that that's a lot.

706
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.978
That's why I usually save
that for the third date.


707
00:29:20.968 --> 00:29:23.153
I don't know what to say, just...

708
00:29:23.304 --> 00:29:26.656
It's okay if you wanna
take me home now.


709
00:29:28.327 --> 00:29:29.451
Take you home?

710
00:29:31.054 --> 00:29:34.313
You just shared an
incredibly personal story.


711
00:29:34.407 --> 00:29:36.391
I mean, I don't want
to take you home,


712
00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:38.168
I want to hear more
of your stories.


713
00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:40.815
It helps me
understand who you are.


714
00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:43.059
And what you've been
through, you and your sister.


715
00:29:43.083 --> 00:29:44.132
And it's a lot.

716
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.918
Thank you.

717
00:29:47.012 --> 00:29:48.511
And now I understand.

718
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.515
I understand why she's doing
what she's doing right now.


719
00:29:54.094 --> 00:29:55.094
What do you mean?

720
00:29:58.023 --> 00:30:00.673
[dramatic music]

721
00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:01.858
No, no, no, no, no, don't.

722
00:30:03.028 --> 00:30:04.176
Don't, don't.

723
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.270
She's spying on us.

724
00:30:05.422 --> 00:30:06.422
No, no.

725
00:30:07.424 --> 00:30:12.110
She was spying on us,
but we're alone now, so.


726
00:30:12.204 --> 00:30:13.778
That's what you think.

727
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.706
No, just let her go okay.

728
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:19.687
Let her go away from here.

729
00:30:19.711 --> 00:30:22.770
And then you and I
will go somewhere else.


730
00:30:22.864 --> 00:30:27.550
We'll go somewhere that
she can't find us, okay.


731
00:30:28.461 --> 00:30:29.939
And we'll stay up all night.

732
00:30:29.963 --> 00:30:32.055
And you can tell me
all of your stories.


733
00:30:32.282 --> 00:30:34.874
And we go hide somewhere
away from the dangers.


734
00:30:34.968 --> 00:30:36.393
Of this crazy world.

735
00:30:37.804 --> 00:30:39.729
[Olivia] that sounds nice.

736
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:42.123
[dramatic music]

737
00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:43.483
[haden] I'll take care of you.

738
00:30:44.385 --> 00:30:46.236
[dramatic music]

739
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.204

742
00:31:05.257 --> 00:31:08.049
[birds chirping]

743
00:31:11.488 --> 00:31:12.837
[Olivia] you're up.

744
00:31:12.989 --> 00:31:14.242
Yeah, of course I'm up.

745
00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:15.723
I've been waiting
for you all night.


746
00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:19.018
You know I was with haden.

747
00:31:20.272 --> 00:31:22.417
I know he's hiding something.

748
00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:23.826
Kyle from work agrees with me.

749
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.275
It's really weird.

750
00:31:25.502 --> 00:31:26.587
That there's nothing
about him online, Olivia.


751
00:31:26.611 --> 00:31:29.070
And I know there is a
killer on the loose.


752
00:31:31.024 --> 00:31:33.450
You sound totally
paranoid right now.


753
00:31:33.677 --> 00:31:36.101
Hey, I just asked you
for a couple of days.


754
00:31:36.196 --> 00:31:38.196
I wanted to check
up on a few things.


755
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.123
You mean break into his studio.

756
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.792
And spy on us while
we're having dinner?


757
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:44.294
I didn't break in.

758
00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:47.355
And I went to that restaurant
to make sure you were safe.


759
00:31:47.448 --> 00:31:48.882
He makes me feel safe, mad die.

760
00:31:50.117 --> 00:31:51.117
I don't trust him.

761
00:31:52.028 --> 00:31:52.947
Okay.

762
00:31:52.971 --> 00:31:54.782
It's time for me to move home.

763
00:31:54.806 --> 00:31:55.972
What?

764
00:31:56.199 --> 00:31:57.860
Todd called, they caught
the guy that broke in.


765
00:31:57.884 --> 00:31:59.178
And they're going to
put bars on my windows.


766
00:31:59.202 --> 00:32:00.955
Yeah, right.

767
00:32:00.979 --> 00:32:02.179
I don't trust that guy either.

768
00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:04.055
That's your problem, mad die.

769
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:05.873
You don't trust anybody.

770
00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:07.295
Do you ever ask
yourself why that is?


771
00:32:07.319 --> 00:32:08.776
I have my reasons.

772
00:32:10.563 --> 00:32:12.396
You blame me for Abigail.

773
00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:14.741
You blame me for
everything, you always have.


774
00:32:16.903 --> 00:32:17.994
I asked you to watch her.

775
00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:22.279
If you thought it was dangerous,

776
00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:24.075
Then why did you leave us?

777
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:25.409
We were just kids.

778
00:32:25.562 --> 00:32:27.315
Did you once say maybe
watch out for that car.


779
00:32:27.339 --> 00:32:28.390
Or that you had a bad feeling?

780
00:32:28.414 --> 00:32:30.006
No.

781
00:32:30.233 --> 00:32:32.033
I've always tried to
protect you, both of you.


782
00:32:33.345 --> 00:32:34.345
That's my job.

783
00:32:36.906 --> 00:32:37.906
I love you, mad die.

784
00:32:39.092 --> 00:32:40.569
But you are not going
to bring back Abigail.


785
00:32:40.593 --> 00:32:42.685
By trying to stop me
from living my life.


786
00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:45.581
Right.

787
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.431
Well, if that's how you feel,
then I guess you should go.


788
00:32:49.194 --> 00:32:50.318
Okay, packing now.

789
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.030
Fine!

What are these for?

795
00:33:50.088 --> 00:33:51.588
What are you doing with these?

796
00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:54.882
Maybe I'm planning
on stealing you away.


797
00:33:56.428 --> 00:33:58.002
It's not funny.

798
00:33:58.096 --> 00:33:59.178
It's just a joke.

799
00:34:00.657 --> 00:34:01.657
Oh, come on.

800
00:34:01.749 --> 00:34:03.766
Oh, so that's it,
you're just gonna leave.


801
00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:06.010
Afraid so.

802
00:34:06.104 --> 00:34:07.104

Maddie.

855

Hold on, mad die, I got you.

856
00:38:41.862 --> 00:38:43.379
There you go.

[people speaking indistinctly]

859
00:38:47.793 --> 00:38:49.385
Someone tried to kill me.

860
00:38:49.612 --> 00:38:51.629
Someone stole my keys and
locked me in the garage.


861
00:38:51.723 --> 00:38:53.275
With the car on.

862
00:38:53.299 --> 00:38:55.703
Luckily my neighbor, Henry,

863
00:38:55.727 --> 00:38:58.227
He heard me and
he dragged me out.


864
00:38:58.454 --> 00:38:59.896
We checked,

865
00:39:00.123 --> 00:39:02.043
There's no evidence anyone
broke into your house.


866
00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:05.717
And Henry said the
door came right open.


867
00:39:05.811 --> 00:39:08.479
I told you they
were all damn shut.


868
00:39:08.631 --> 00:39:10.239
Any idea who would
do such a thing?


869
00:39:11.743 --> 00:39:14.652
I was out earlier this evening.

870
00:39:14.804 --> 00:39:17.488
And maybe someone
followed me home.


871
00:39:17.582 --> 00:39:18.414
Out where?

872
00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:19.582
Park sports bar.

873
00:39:20.993 --> 00:39:22.433
[policewoman] well
were you drinking?


874
00:39:23.663 --> 00:39:24.754
I wasn't drunk.

875
00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:26.255
You left your purse in the car.

876
00:39:26.407 --> 00:39:27.234
No, I didn't.

877
00:39:27.258 --> 00:39:28.591
I don't know how it got there.

878
00:39:28.818 --> 00:39:31.669
I told you someone put it there.

879
00:39:31.763 --> 00:39:33.315
And locked you in the garage?

880
00:39:33.339 --> 00:39:34.505
Yes.

881
00:39:34.657 --> 00:39:36.824
Has there been
any unusual stress.


882
00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:38.601
Or trauma in your life lately?

883
00:39:38.828 --> 00:39:40.678
What does that have
to do with anything?


884
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.664
I'm just wondering if
you've been experiencing.


885
00:39:43.757 --> 00:39:47.001
Any depression or dark thoughts.

886
00:39:47.094 --> 00:39:49.186
You think, I tried
to kill myself.


887
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.280
[people speaking indistinctly]

888
00:39:51.507 --> 00:39:54.191
I'm trying to tell you,
someone tried to kill me.


889
00:39:54.285 --> 00:39:56.597
You're the police, do something.

890
00:39:56.621 --> 00:39:58.287
Maddie, are you okay?

891
00:40:01.442 --> 00:40:03.512
I suggest you come to the
station in the morning.


892
00:40:03.536 --> 00:40:06.212
And tell your story
to a detective,


893
00:40:07.373 --> 00:40:08.493
If that's what you wanna do.

894
00:40:08.524 --> 00:40:09.524
[mad die] thank you.

895
00:40:12.028 --> 00:40:13.028
You okay?

896
00:40:13.805 --> 00:40:15.546
[mad die] what's he doing here?

897
00:40:15.698 --> 00:40:16.547
He drove me.

898
00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:18.140
I was too upset to drive.

899
00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:20.384
Where's he been all night?

900
00:40:20.536 --> 00:40:22.645
What? He was next to me,
he was in bed with me.


901
00:40:22.872 --> 00:40:23.554
When I got the call.

902
00:40:23.706 --> 00:40:24.388
No.

903
00:40:24.482 --> 00:40:25.556
What?

904
00:40:25.708 --> 00:40:27.228
Come on, I'm just so
happy you're okay.

How are you feeling?

907
00:40:53.085 --> 00:40:54.844
Just a little headache.

908
00:40:55.071 --> 00:40:56.071
That's good.

909
00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:58.670
That is, just a little one.

910
00:41:01.185 --> 00:41:03.519
So when do you wanna go
down to the police station?


911
00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:06.742
I don't know.

912
00:41:06.766 --> 00:41:07.766
You don't know?

913
00:41:07.917 --> 00:41:08.917
[mad die] no.

914
00:41:09.843 --> 00:41:12.528
You said someone tried
to kill you last night.


915
00:41:12.755 --> 00:41:15.322
They did, but the cops
don't believe me, so.


916
00:41:16.683 --> 00:41:17.683
So make them.

917
00:41:18.703 --> 00:41:20.453
I shouldn't have to
convince you to do this.


918
00:41:21.597 --> 00:41:22.597
Unless.

919
00:41:26.044 --> 00:41:29.211
Olivia, I didn't
try to hurt myself.


920
00:41:30.606 --> 00:41:32.214
I know how this looks, okay.

921
00:41:33.384 --> 00:41:36.794
And I wanna apologize to you
for all of the accusations.


922
00:41:36.946 --> 00:41:38.345
And the crazy behavior.

923
00:41:39.557 --> 00:41:42.058
[car engines revving]

924
00:41:42.209 --> 00:41:44.351
Maybe it's time you put
this article to rest.

[birds chirping]

926
00:41:47.473 --> 00:41:49.139
Hey, I have an idea.

927
00:41:49.233 --> 00:41:52.526
How about, to say sorry, I
make you do dinner tonight?


928
00:41:54.388 --> 00:41:55.479
You don't have to do that.

929
00:41:55.573 --> 00:41:56.573
I want to.

930
00:41:58.134 --> 00:42:00.576
Okay, yeah, no, I'd
really like that.


931
00:42:00.803 --> 00:42:01.722
Okay.

932
00:42:01.746 --> 00:42:03.579
I'll make your favorite.

933
00:42:04.898 --> 00:42:05.915
This'll be good.

934
00:42:06.142 --> 00:42:07.491
Good.

Ah, this has been truly
amazing, mad die, thank you.


938
00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:18.410
Well, I would do
anything for Olivia.


939
00:42:18.504 --> 00:42:19.911
I just wanna see her happy.

940
00:42:20.005 --> 00:42:22.681
Yeah, I know that feeling.

941
00:42:24.176 --> 00:42:27.489
And this has made me really
happy, mad die, thank you.


942
00:42:27.513 --> 00:42:29.605
So have you two thought
about the future?


943
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.757
Actually, yeah.

944
00:42:32.852 --> 00:42:33.852
[both laughing]

945
00:42:34.003 --> 00:42:35.003
Well?

946
00:42:37.115 --> 00:42:39.927
A little house in the country,

947
00:42:39.951 --> 00:42:42.785
Somewhere we can see
the stars every night.


948
00:42:43.012 --> 00:42:45.770
Live off the land, you
know, commune with nature.


949
00:42:45.865 --> 00:42:47.935
Were you raised in the country?

950
00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:49.291
Yeah.

951
00:42:49.518 --> 00:42:50.626
Yeah, I was.

952
00:42:50.853 --> 00:42:51.680
And where was that?

953
00:42:51.704 --> 00:42:53.203
Maddie.

954
00:42:53.356 --> 00:42:57.519
Sorry, promised I wouldn't
play a reporter tonight.


955
00:42:57.543 --> 00:42:59.552
Just wanna get to know
the man my sister loves.


956
00:43:01.697 --> 00:43:03.430
No, look, it's
fine, she's right.


957
00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:07.718
I'll warn you though, I'm
not really comfortable.


958
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.145
Talking about myself, so.

959
00:43:10.222 --> 00:43:11.792
Well, that's fair enough.

960
00:43:11.816 --> 00:43:13.040
[haden] yeah.

961
00:43:13.133 --> 00:43:13.891
How about we finish
off this wine?


962
00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:15.225
[Olivia] okay.

963
00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:16.319
Thank you.

964
00:43:18.047 --> 00:43:19.047
Here you go.

965
00:43:20.658 --> 00:43:22.549
You two look so cute.

966
00:43:22.643 --> 00:43:24.003
Get together for
a picture for you.


967
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.547

Aw, cute, cute, cute.

971
00:43:36.156 --> 00:43:37.156
It's a keeper.

972
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.008
She sure is.

974
00:43:40.753 --> 00:43:41.919

To love.

[dramatic music]

978
00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:56.433
You don't have to do that.

979
00:43:56.527 --> 00:43:58.919
Dinner was so delicious.

980
00:43:59.012 --> 00:44:00.863
The least I can do is
help you with the dishes.


981
00:44:02.942 --> 00:44:03.942
You're beautiful.

982
00:44:06.779 --> 00:44:09.371
See, it's not so bad, right?

983
00:44:10.524 --> 00:44:11.524
No, I guess not.

984
00:44:15.862 --> 00:44:16.690
Thank you.

985

[dramatic music]

986
00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:19.715
Oh.

987
00:44:19.942 --> 00:44:21.275
What's that?

988
00:44:21.368 --> 00:44:23.271
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't see it there.


989
00:44:23.295 --> 00:44:25.199
Did you do that on purpose?

990
00:44:25.223 --> 00:44:25.963
[dramatic music]

991
00:44:26.057 --> 00:44:27.223
What?

992
00:44:27.374 --> 00:44:28.702
I can pay for repairs
or get you a new one?


993
00:44:28.726 --> 00:44:30.041
I mean...

994
00:44:30.135 --> 00:44:31.575
No, why would you
do that on purpose?


995
00:44:32.546 --> 00:44:34.063
[dramatic music]

996
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.732
Haden, would you mind
waiting in the truck?


997
00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:39.026
I think I need to talk to
my sister for a minute.


998
00:44:40.738 --> 00:44:41.738
Yeah.

999
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.221
Thank you for a lovely evening.

[dramatic music]

1001
00:44:48.913 --> 00:44:50.412
I'll be outside.

[dramatic music]

1003
00:44:54.752 --> 00:44:55.752
Olivia, there are still.

1004
00:44:55.978 --> 00:44:57.253
Please let me talk.

1005
00:44:59.757 --> 00:45:01.142
I love haden, mad die.

1006
00:45:01.166 --> 00:45:02.591
You just met him.

1007
00:45:02.818 --> 00:45:03.926
I know that.

1008
00:45:04.077 --> 00:45:05.739
I understand that.

1009
00:45:05.763 --> 00:45:07.223
And that's why we're not
rushing off to get married.


1010
00:45:07.247 --> 00:45:09.743
But do you realize
you've done this.


1011
00:45:09.767 --> 00:45:11.892
With every man I've
ever been interested in?


1012
00:45:13.754 --> 00:45:16.083
And I appreciate it, I
understand why you do it.


1013
00:45:16.107 --> 00:45:19.024
But I really care
about him, mad die.


1014
00:45:20.853 --> 00:45:22.686
You have to let me figure
this out for myself.


1015
00:45:22.838 --> 00:45:24.258
Without interfering.

1016
00:45:24.282 --> 00:45:25.781
Can you do that?

1017
00:45:25.932 --> 00:45:28.191
[gentle music]

1018
00:45:28.344 --> 00:45:30.704
I just need you to trust me to
make this decision on my own.


1019
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.680
Okay.

1020
00:45:34.107 --> 00:45:35.107
Thank you.

1021
00:45:35.942 --> 00:45:37.793
But you know, there is something.

1022
00:45:37.944 --> 00:45:40.682
That I just still
don't know about him,


1023
00:45:40.706 --> 00:45:43.110
It's just driving me crazy.

Olivia, wait.

1027
00:45:49.198 --> 00:45:49.972
[Olivia] no.

1028
00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:52.866
Olivia, Olivia wait.

1029
00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:54.643
We still don't know
where he's from.


1030
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.710
And even kyle can't find
a trace of him online.


1031
00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.626
And he could have snuck
over here last night.


1032
00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:00.983
And stolen my key from my purse.

1033
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.037
Olivia.

Look, I wanna get this guy too,

1041
00:46:18.836 --> 00:46:20.669
But there's nothing I
can do to save this.


1042
00:46:20.896 --> 00:46:22.320
What?

1043
00:46:22.414 --> 00:46:23.633
But I need those photos for the
facial recognition software.


1044
00:46:23.657 --> 00:46:26.008
Shh, shh, quiet.

1045
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.236
What can we do?

1046
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:31.088
Okay, when you
back up your files,


1047
00:46:31.182 --> 00:46:33.515
Do you do it automatically
or is it scheduled?


1048
00:46:33.667 --> 00:46:34.667
I don't know.

1049
00:46:34.743 --> 00:46:35.996
You could get lucky.

1050
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.331
If your settings
aren't automatic,


1051
00:46:37.355 --> 00:46:39.407
Then your pictures
should be in the cloud.


1052
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:41.857
Okay, well, do you
think we can get 'em?


1053
00:46:42.084 --> 00:46:43.859
Here, I'll show you how
to log in and check.

00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:38.927
But we can go ahead and get
started.


1090
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:40.399
You want to tell me what
happened?


1091
00:50:41.657 --> 00:50:43.098
I came here to meet kyle.

1092
00:50:43.325 --> 00:50:46.246
And when I got here,
I found him like that.


1093
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:47.936
I didn't see anyone
else in the building.


1094
00:50:48.163 --> 00:50:50.163
Did you check the
security cameras?


1095
00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:52.515
Someone tamped with
the breaker box,


1096
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.861
Footage was cut off roughly
half hour before kyle's death.


1097
00:50:57.189 --> 00:50:59.114
What were you two doing
in here after hours?


1098
00:50:59.341 --> 00:51:00.341
We were.

1099
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.343
Sorry for the delay.

1100
00:51:03.436 --> 00:51:04.953
I was just wrapping
up with your boss.


1101
00:51:08.108 --> 00:51:11.201
Miss. Mcintyre, my
partner, detective Houston.


1102
00:51:11.295 --> 00:51:14.087
[dramatic music]

1103
00:51:22.473 --> 00:51:24.473
Okay, miss. Mcintyre,

1104
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.975
Please tell us why you
two were in there tonight.


1105
00:51:32.149 --> 00:51:33.556
We were working on an article.

1106
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:35.703
We were investigating a story.

1107
00:51:35.727 --> 00:51:37.969
Kyle told me that he
had found something.


1108
00:51:38.063 --> 00:51:39.103
And asked me to come over.

1109
00:51:40.565 --> 00:51:44.142
What was the article about?

1110
00:51:44.236 --> 00:51:46.306
We were connecting the
disappearances of three women.


1111
00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:47.330
To a single perpetrator.

1112
00:51:48.982 --> 00:51:50.314
It's all on the computers.

1113
00:51:50.409 --> 00:51:51.917
His hard drive was wiped clean.

1114
00:51:52.836 --> 00:51:54.336
What?

1115
00:51:54.487 --> 00:51:56.505
Our it specialists are
gonna try and recover it.


1116
00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:58.559
Well, it's obvious that
the killer did all this.


1117
00:51:58.583 --> 00:52:00.061
They wiped the drives clean.

1118
00:52:00.085 --> 00:52:01.229
And they mess with
the security cameras.


1119
00:52:01.253 --> 00:52:02.344
Before we go any further,

1120
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:03.898
Would you like to
have lawyer present?


1121
00:52:03.922 --> 00:52:04.513
Why?

1122
00:52:04.664 --> 00:52:06.089
I didn't kill him.

1123
00:52:06.183 --> 00:52:08.328
[dramatic music]

1124
00:52:08.352 --> 00:52:09.737
Whoever did this
was the same person.


1125
00:52:09.761 --> 00:52:12.429
That tried to kill
me two nights ago.


1126
00:52:12.523 --> 00:52:14.672
Someone tried to kill
you, two nights ago?


1127
00:52:14.766 --> 00:52:16.336
And there's record of this?

1128
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.769
Yeah, an officer
came by my house.


1129
00:52:19.922 --> 00:52:22.197
I'm not sure how much she
put in the actual report.


1130
00:52:23.592 --> 00:52:25.345
She said I needed to
come down to the station.


1131
00:52:25.369 --> 00:52:26.369
And talk to a detective.

1132
00:52:27.446 --> 00:52:28.203
And did you do that?

1133
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:29.037
[mad die] no.

1134
00:52:29.264 --> 00:52:30.264
Why not?

1135
00:52:31.691 --> 00:52:33.875
I just thought I could
handle it myself.


1136
00:52:35.287 --> 00:52:36.764
So let me get this straight,

1137
00:52:36.788 --> 00:52:38.288
Someone tried to kill you.

1138
00:52:38.382 --> 00:52:40.623
And you didn't follow
up with the department?


1139
00:52:40.718 --> 00:52:42.217
I followed up with kyle.

1140
00:52:42.444 --> 00:52:44.698
We were honing in on a few
subjects, we were close.


1141
00:52:44.722 --> 00:52:47.297
Whoever did this
was the same person.


1142
00:52:47.449 --> 00:52:48.724
Who murdered those women.

1143
00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:50.370
It's the same person
who tried to kill me.


1144
00:52:50.394 --> 00:52:51.852
Do you have any names?

1145
00:52:58.569 --> 00:53:00.527
Todd young and haden Carmichael.

1146
00:53:01.721 --> 00:53:04.406
[dramatic music]

1147
00:53:06.076 --> 00:53:07.076
Can I go now?

1148
00:53:08.078 --> 00:53:09.389
Sure.

1149
00:53:09.413 --> 00:53:10.413
We'll be in touch.

1150
00:53:11.564 --> 00:53:12.564
Thank you.

1151
00:53:19.164 --> 00:53:20.164
What do you mean?

1152
00:53:21.166 --> 00:53:22.340
You asked her to lawyer up?

1153
00:53:23.668 --> 00:53:26.011
She seemed shook up, I
thought it would help.


1154
00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:31.530
Just trying to
figure things out.


1155
00:53:32.585 --> 00:53:35.270
[dramatic music]

1156
00:53:37.257 --> 00:53:38.752
Yeah, over here.

1157
00:53:38.776 --> 00:53:42.861
[people speaking indistinctly]

1158
00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:46.948
Oh, excuse me.

1159
00:53:47.175 --> 00:53:48.175
Maddie.

1160
00:53:50.195 --> 00:53:51.620
I don't know what to say.

1161
00:53:51.771 --> 00:53:52.954
It's horrible.

1162
00:53:53.181 --> 00:53:54.675
It's just horrible.

1163
00:53:54.699 --> 00:53:56.269
I know.

1164
00:53:56.293 --> 00:53:58.351
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.


1165
00:53:58.444 --> 00:54:00.348
This is why we're
in this situation.


1166
00:54:00.372 --> 00:54:03.706
You doing a job that
no one asked you to do.


1167
00:54:03.859 --> 00:54:06.617
But I'm getting closer
to finding the killer.


1168
00:54:06.711 --> 00:54:07.886
You need to stop.

1169
00:54:08.788 --> 00:54:10.380
Just stop.

1170
00:54:10.474 --> 00:54:13.867
A man is dead because you
wouldn't listen to me.


1171
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.386
I can't do this
with you anymore.


1172
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.480
I'm sorry.

1173
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.150
Are you firing me?

1174
00:54:23.545 --> 00:54:26.321
You turned our offices
into a crime scene.


1175
00:54:26.548 --> 00:54:30.992
You and kyle were sneaking
around operating behind my back.


1176
00:54:32.571 --> 00:54:35.479
Even if this hadn't happened,
your work as a reporter.


1177
00:54:35.574 --> 00:54:38.741
Has been completely unreliable.

1178
00:54:38.836 --> 00:54:40.585
So, yes, I'm firing you.

1179
00:54:45.676 --> 00:54:46.676
I'm sorry, Rachel.

1180
00:54:50.496 --> 00:54:52.138
Save your apologies
for his parents.


1181

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:19.927
Yes.

Detective willett, detective
Houston, Atlanta metro.


1188
00:55:23.363 --> 00:55:24.546
A haden Carmichael live here?

1189
00:55:27.533 --> 00:55:28.533
Yeah, that's me.

1190
00:55:29.945 --> 00:55:30.627
How can I help you?

1191
00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:31.721
Is this about mad die?

1192
00:55:34.224 --> 00:55:35.632
She's my sister.

1193
00:55:35.784 --> 00:55:37.784
She failed to mention
that in our interview.


1194
00:55:37.877 --> 00:55:38.877
Interview?

1195
00:55:39.879 --> 00:55:40.781
[dramatic music]

1196
00:55:40.805 --> 00:55:42.380
Do you know a kyle Johnson?

1197
00:55:42.474 --> 00:55:45.525
I don't, never heard that name.

1198
00:55:46.904 --> 00:55:48.456
He was a colleague
of your sister's.


1199
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.738
He was murdered last night.

1200
00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:51.239
[dramatic music]

1201
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.219
That's terrible.

1202
00:55:53.243 --> 00:55:55.393
Whatever we can do
to help you guys.


1203
00:55:55.487 --> 00:55:56.607
Actually, your name came up.

1204

[dramatic music]

1205
00:55:57.489 --> 00:55:58.580
What do you mean?

1206
00:55:58.731 --> 00:56:00.042
She said she was
investigating you.


1207
00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:01.546
In connection with
some missing women.


1208
00:56:01.585 --> 00:56:02.492
[dramatic music]

1209
00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:04.252
Unbelievable.

1210
00:56:04.404 --> 00:56:06.087
Unbelievable.

1211
00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:07.589
Where were you last night?

1212
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:08.757
[dramatic music]

1213
00:56:08.984 --> 00:56:10.316
He was here with me.

1214
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:11.501
All night?

1215
00:56:11.595 --> 00:56:12.427
All night.

1216
00:56:12.578 --> 00:56:13.836
[birds chirping]

1217
00:56:13.989 --> 00:56:15.575
Any ideas as to why her
sister would accuse you.


1218
00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:16.673
Of being a killer?

1219
00:56:16.825 --> 00:56:18.675
[car engine revving]

1220
00:56:18.769 --> 00:56:22.437
Listen, you have to understand,
I love my sister to death,


1221
00:56:22.664 --> 00:56:25.919
But she gets a little
crazy overprotective.


1222
00:56:25.943 --> 00:56:28.588
And for whatever reason,
she just has it in her head.


1223
00:56:28.612 --> 00:56:31.112
That she has to protect me
from haden and everybody.


1224
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:32.931
All right.

1225
00:56:33.008 --> 00:56:36.117
[jack speaking indistinctly]

1226
00:56:36.344 --> 00:56:37.344
Yeah.

1227
00:56:39.289 --> 00:56:40.289
Is your name jack?

1228
00:56:41.516 --> 00:56:43.533
Yeah, from the
seek and date app.


1229
00:56:43.627 --> 00:56:46.439
Did you ever end up
hooking up with my sister?

[birds chirping]

1235
00:57:06.817 --> 00:57:08.577
You were messing around with
a suspect, jack?


1236
00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:09.634
What the heck?

1237
00:57:09.987 --> 00:57:11.372
I screwed up.

1238
00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:13.655
Big time, jack. Big time.

1239
00:57:13.882 --> 00:57:15.522
When were you going to
tell me about this?


1240
00:57:16.051 --> 00:57:17.575
I messed up, I was
gonna tell you.


1241
00:57:22.574 --> 00:57:23.654
What are we gonna do, babe?

1242
00:57:24.984 --> 00:57:26.479
I don't know.

1243
00:57:26.503 --> 00:57:28.055
[birds chirping]

1244
00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:30.913
Yeah, I do, I just
don't want to say it.


1245
00:57:31.008 --> 00:57:32.674
Then don't please.

1246
00:57:33.677 --> 00:57:35.010
Come on.

00:57:35.237 --> 00:57:36.564
Look, sometimes you just
have to cut toxic people.


1248
00:57:36.588 --> 00:57:38.566
Outta your life, you know that.

1249
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:39.922
She's my sister, haden.

1250
00:57:40.075 --> 00:57:41.402
Yes.

1251
00:57:41.426 --> 00:57:42.642
And she's never gonna stop.

1252
00:57:43.745 --> 00:57:44.745
I know.

1253
00:57:46.356 --> 00:57:48.023
She's all I have, right?

1254
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:51.609
Hey, hey, that is not
true, okay, you have me.

1256
00:57:55.515 --> 00:57:56.515
Crazy thought.

1257
00:57:57.776 --> 00:58:00.702
What if we leave town, hmm?

1258
00:58:00.929 --> 00:58:03.538
Just get away from
all the chaos.

[dramatic music]

1260
00:58:05.042 --> 00:58:06.449
Where would we go?

1261
00:58:06.543 --> 00:58:07.876
I have the perfect spot.

1262
00:58:08.027 --> 00:58:09.878
It's about two
hours south of here,


1263
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:12.464
Just pass vidalia,
in the low country.


1264
00:58:14.442 --> 00:58:15.216
It's the running water?

1265
00:58:15.443 --> 00:58:16.443
Yeah.

1266
00:58:16.611 --> 00:58:17.293
And electricity too.

You're gonna love it,
it's beautiful, paradise.


1269
00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:23.944
When?

1270
00:58:23.968 --> 00:58:24.968
Now.

1271
00:58:26.379 --> 00:58:27.379
What do you say?

1272
00:58:27.972 --> 00:58:28.783
Now?

1273
00:58:28.807 --> 00:58:29.807
Now?

1274
00:58:30.567 --> 00:58:31.974
Yeah.

1275
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:33.568
- Yeah.
- Great.


1276
00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:35.122
I'll go pack.

1277
00:58:35.146 --> 00:58:36.957
Perfect, just hurry up,

1278
00:58:36.981 --> 00:58:38.459
I'd love to get on the road.

1279
00:58:38.483 --> 00:58:40.683
Yeah, I'll be quick, I'm just
gonna take a quick shower.


1280
00:58:40.726 --> 00:58:43.244
Great, I'm gonna change
and load up the truck.

Where's your partner?

1285
00:59:10.515 --> 00:59:12.348
She doesn't know I'm here.

1286
00:59:12.442 --> 00:59:13.753
Can I come in?

1287
00:59:13.777 --> 00:59:15.610
Are you gonna
interrogate me some more?


1288
00:59:15.837 --> 00:59:16.589
No.

1290
00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:18.839

1293
00:59:26.681 --> 00:59:28.915
So did you find the killer yet?

1294
00:59:30.127 --> 00:59:32.105
I'm off the case.

1295
00:59:32.129 --> 00:59:33.753
In fact, I'm on
administrative leave.


1296
00:59:34.798 --> 00:59:35.946
Because of me?

1297
00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.875
No, because of me.

1298
00:59:38.969 --> 00:59:41.948
When I saw you last night,
I didn't know what to do.


1299
00:59:41.972 --> 00:59:43.954
My first thought
was to protect you.


1300
00:59:44.048 --> 00:59:45.785
Well, isn't that your job?

1301
00:59:45.809 --> 00:59:49.978
No, I mean really protect you
from what's about to happen.


1302
00:59:51.815 --> 00:59:52.981
What do you mean?

1303
00:59:53.208 --> 00:59:55.057
I mean, everybody has
an alibi, but you,


1304
00:59:55.152 --> 00:59:57.393
This guy Todd, it turns
out he was out of town.


1305
00:59:57.487 --> 00:59:58.965
Visiting family.

1306
00:59:58.989 --> 01:00:01.489
And haden, your sister says
he was with her all night.


1307
01:00:03.218 --> 01:00:04.879
She's lying.

1308
01:00:04.903 --> 01:00:06.547
Kyle told me that
he found something.


1309
01:00:06.571 --> 01:00:08.641
Well, we can't prove that.

1310
01:00:08.665 --> 01:00:10.556
What we can prove
is the murder weapon.


1311
01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:11.833
Has your fingerprints on it.

1312
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.651
Of course it has my
fingerprints on it,


1313
01:00:13.745 --> 01:00:15.336
It's my pair of scissors.

1314
01:00:15.488 --> 01:00:16.488
You see the problem.

1315
01:00:17.674 --> 01:00:19.226
This is crazy.

1316
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:20.416
You know he's setting me up.

1317
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:21.676
I believe you.

1318
01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.011
That's why I'm here.

1319
01:00:23.238 --> 01:00:25.087
To tell you to get
yourself a good lawyer.


1320
01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.015
And don't say another
word to the police.


1321
01:00:27.242 --> 01:00:28.242
Okay.

1322
01:00:28.852 --> 01:00:29.759

[car engines revving]

1326

Why are you doing this?

1327
01:00:43.033 --> 01:00:44.941
Why do you think?

Hey, hey, big boy.

Come here.

Hey, come here!

1337

Big boy, did you do this?

1338
01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:25.723
Do what?

1339
01:01:25.817 --> 01:01:26.908
Throw these in the trash.

1340
01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.554
This is olivia's phone
and charger, right?


1341
01:01:28.578 --> 01:01:30.056
I don't know, I mean,
what does it matter?


1342
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.989
You need to properly dispose
of your used electronics.


1343
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:35.825
The city's really cracking
down, I could get fined.

You know what?

1346
01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:41.756
You're right, it
probably was me.


1347
01:01:41.983 --> 01:01:44.645
I'll take this from you
and won't happen again.


1348
01:01:44.669 --> 01:01:45.646
Sorry about that.

1349
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:46.886
Great, thank you.

1350
01:01:48.932 --> 01:01:51.173
Olivia tells me you guys
are going on a trip,


1351
01:01:51.326 --> 01:01:53.393
Down south past vidalia
in the low country.


1352
01:01:56.255 --> 01:01:57.847
When did you tell you that?

1353
01:01:57.941 --> 01:01:59.941
Oh, just a few minutes ago,
ran into her out front.


1354
01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:02.184

What do you need?

1365
01:02:32.124 --> 01:02:33.344
I didn't get the
name of the place.


1366
01:02:33.368 --> 01:02:35.051
Where I can recycle,
donate these.


1367
01:02:35.145 --> 01:02:36.864
I was wondering, maybe
you have a phone number?


1368
01:02:36.888 --> 01:02:37.979
I sure do.

1369

gotta get my phone.

Huh.

I guess that's everything.

Okay, great, you ready to go?

1381
01:03:24.919 --> 01:03:26.321
Yes, I just have to
say goodbye to Todd.


1382
01:03:26.345 --> 01:03:28.174
No, no, I just did.

If Jennifer Richards ever
took a self-defense class.


1393
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:58.284
Hi, did your friend ever take
taekwondo or self-defense?


1394
01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:00.136
Did your niece know
how to fight back?


1395
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:02.563
You happen to know the
name of the instructor?


1396
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:04.732
No, I don't know that name.

1397
01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:07.902
You know I have a photo.

1398
01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:09.478
Can I text it to you,

1399
01:04:09.572 --> 01:04:12.982
And you can get back to
me if you recognize him?

Everything okay?

1404
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:29.908
Yeah, it's my phone.

1405
01:04:31.928 --> 01:04:32.928
[haden] what about it?

1406
01:04:34.931 --> 01:04:37.743
Could have sworn I put it
in my purse with my charger.


1407
01:04:37.767 --> 01:04:40.101
Yeah, you're not
gonna need your phone.


1408
01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:44.442
What if something
happens to my sister?


1409
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:48.776
Oh, I am sure we will hear
all about it when we get back.


1410
01:04:49.946 --> 01:04:51.779
Besides we talked
about this, you know,


1411
01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:54.782
We can't keep putting
up with her crap.


1412
01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.033
I think we should go back.

1413
01:05:04.127 --> 01:05:07.870
Oh, geez enough all right,
enough about the phone.


1414
01:05:07.964 --> 01:05:10.256
You see this is why I
don't have one of those.


1415

'Cause people are addicted.

turn up right.

you left it behind,

Hi, I'm just trying to find
out some more about haden,


1429
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.749
Maybe where he came from.

1430
01:05:53.901 --> 01:05:56.511
Did he ever mention anything,
when he started at the studio,


1431
01:05:56.738 --> 01:05:58.298
About where he might
have taught before?


1432
01:05:58.348 --> 01:05:59.975
[gym worker] well, that's
none of my business, ma'am.


1433
01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:01.051
And I don't really
see what it matters.


1434
01:06:01.075 --> 01:06:01.924
Well, it matters because.

1435
01:06:02.018 --> 01:06:03.237
[gym worker] besides,

1436
01:06:03.261 --> 01:06:04.722
He doesn't teach
there anymore anyway.


1437
01:06:04.746 --> 01:06:06.147
He's not teaching at
the studio anymore?


1438
01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:07.241
[gym worker] apparently not.

1439
01:06:07.265 --> 01:06:08.171
Well, did he quit?

1440
01:06:08.266 --> 01:06:09.502
[gym worker] no, ma'am.

1441
01:06:09.526 --> 01:06:11.341
Closed his lease, said
he was leaving town.


1442
01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:12.412
He's leaving town?

1443
01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:13.528
[gym worker] yep.

He was accused of killing
his wife six years ago,

But the case was thrown
out due to bad evidence.


1581
01:13:10.688 --> 01:13:12.407
You should be giving this
information to your lawyer.


1582
01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:13.781
So he needed a fresh start.

1583
01:13:13.932 --> 01:13:16.341

behave yourself okay.

1625
01:14:50.104 --> 01:14:50.786
You mad die?

1626
01:14:50.938 --> 01:14:51.931
[mad die] yeah, I am.

1627
01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:53.789
I've seen this guy before.

1628
01:14:53.883 --> 01:14:56.383
He's doing some work up
on the old carter mansion.


1629
01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:57.959
It's about 12 miles
off the highway.


1630
01:14:58.054 --> 01:14:59.773
Now, you're gonna have
to take the old road,


1631
01:14:59.797 --> 01:15:02.130
It's grown over but
you can still drive it.


1632
01:15:02.224 --> 01:15:03.702
That looks like it takes
me right up to the front.


1633
01:15:03.726 --> 01:15:04.870
Is there another way?

1634
01:15:04.894 --> 01:15:07.447
You could turn
here on larder lane.


1635
01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:09.621
And that'll take
you in from the side.


1636
01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:10.617
Just take that map with you.

1637
01:15:10.641 --> 01:15:12.307
Hey, and here's that note.

1638
01:15:12.459 --> 01:15:13.383
Thanks.

1639
01:15:13.477 --> 01:15:14.477
[Charles] you're welcome.

1640
01:15:15.571 --> 01:15:17.887

1642

[dramatic music]

1643
01:15:28.976 --> 01:15:29.976
Hello.

1644
01:15:32.162 --> 01:15:33.754
Oh, there you are.

1645
01:15:35.165 --> 01:15:38.092
I brought you a little gift.

1646
01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:43.097
And I also made us
a really nice dinner.


1647
01:15:44.767 --> 01:15:47.579
And I was kind of hoping
that we can just get past.


1648
01:15:47.603 --> 01:15:51.939
All the ugliness from earlier,
start enjoying ourselves.


1649
01:15:53.442 --> 01:15:54.833
That be best.

1650
01:15:54.926 --> 01:15:56.610
So why don't you get dressed.

1651
01:15:57.947 --> 01:15:59.787
And I'll come back and
get you in a little bit.


1652
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:03.909
[dramatic music]

1653
01:16:09.183 --> 01:16:11.700

[dramatic music]

1657
01:16:30.295 --> 01:16:32.980
Everything you see
is from the forest,


1658
01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:37.484
The mushrooms, the
greens, the protein.


1659
01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:40.562
It's all from right here.

1660
01:16:40.714 --> 01:16:41.714
I hope you like it.

1661
01:16:44.051 --> 01:16:46.326
Oh, a toast.

1662
01:16:48.222 --> 01:16:50.475
To our first dinner
in our new home.


1663
01:16:50.499 --> 01:16:51.406
[glasses clinking]

1664
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.666
Not our last.

1665
01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.150

[dramatic music]

1668
01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:12.093
So, I've been meaning
to ask you,


1669
01:17:12.188 --> 01:17:13.836
Boys or girls?

1670
01:17:14.264 --> 01:17:18.192
Kids, do you wanna
have boys or girls?


1671
01:17:18.343 --> 01:17:21.195
Either way, I know you're
gonna make the perfect mother.


1672
01:17:21.422 --> 01:17:23.939
I've known it from
the moment I saw you.


1673
01:17:24.033 --> 01:17:25.515
[dramatic music]

1674
01:17:25.609 --> 01:17:27.846

1677
01:17:36.045 --> 01:17:39.524

1678
01:17:39.548 --> 01:17:41.882
[tool banging]

1679
01:17:45.963 --> 01:17:47.387
Do you hear that?

1680
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:51.391
Well I did.

1681
01:17:51.543 --> 01:17:53.560
I'll check on that.

1682
01:17:57.791 --> 01:17:59.808
You can put your
knife back though.


1683
01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.143
You're not gonna need
it while I'm gone.


1684
01:18:02.238 --> 01:18:04.905
[dramatic music]

1685
01:18:13.974 --> 01:18:14.823
You.

1686
01:18:14.975 --> 01:18:17.729
This is why I like you so much.

1687
01:18:17.753 --> 01:18:18.919
You're a fighter.

1688
01:18:20.589 --> 01:18:22.089
[dramatic music]

1689
01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.884
That's why you are
my special girl.


1690
01:18:28.489 --> 01:18:32.766
And don't even think
about running away,


1691
01:18:35.829 --> 01:18:39.659
'cause if you do, I'll
come after you again.


1692
01:18:39.683 --> 01:18:44.185
Except this time,
I won't be so nice.


1693
01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.947
[dramatic music]

1694
01:18:49.618 --> 01:18:50.784
You know, use your fork.

1697
01:19:04.358 --> 01:19:05.277
Maddie?

1698
01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:06.352
- [mad die] we have to go.
- Oh my god.


1699
01:19:06.376 --> 01:19:07.376
Come on let's go.

1700
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:10.857
[dramatic music]

1701
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:13.882
He's gonna kill us, mad die.

1702
01:19:13.976 --> 01:19:16.718
[both screaming]

1703
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:18.219
Where do you think you're going?

1704
01:19:18.314 --> 01:19:20.981
[dramatic music]

1705
01:19:24.211 --> 01:19:25.226
Nice.

Here's something I
haven't taught you yet.

[dramatic music]

1711
01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:37.238

No, no, no.

1715
01:19:51.738 --> 01:19:53.238
No, no.

1716
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:55.924
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1717
01:19:56.076 --> 01:19:57.517
Baby, no.

1718
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:58.669
It's okay.

1719
01:19:59.763 --> 01:20:01.521
Baby, no, please no.

1720
01:20:02.749 --> 01:20:04.099
No, no.

1721
01:20:04.193 --> 01:20:05.600
Oh, please no.

1723
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:09.178
No, no, no!

1731
01:21:00.307 --> 01:21:02.727
Quiet, quiet, you
have to be quiet.


1732
01:21:02.751 --> 01:21:03.658
Where are they?

1733
01:21:03.752 --> 01:21:04.729
I don't know.

1734
01:21:04.753 --> 01:21:05.326
Are you all right?

1735
01:21:05.479 --> 01:21:06.995
No, no, no.

No.

1744
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:25.190
You come with me,
come on, come on.

[mad die crying]

1746

[dramatic music]

1748
01:21:51.191 --> 01:21:52.191
Hey.

1749
01:21:57.197 --> 01:21:58.197
You.

1750
01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:02.954
This whole thing is on you.

1751
01:22:02.978 --> 01:22:05.770
[insects chirping]

1752
01:22:09.559 --> 01:22:13.987
Olivia and I, we just wanted
to start a life together.


1753
01:22:14.214 --> 01:22:18.044
But you, you had to
interfere, didn't you?


1754
01:22:18.068 --> 01:22:19.326
That's.

1755
01:22:19.553 --> 01:22:23.121
Shh, the only thing out
of your mouth right now.


1756
01:22:24.315 --> 01:22:25.499
Should be an apology.

1757
01:22:27.002 --> 01:22:29.961
[insects chirping]

1758
01:22:31.414 --> 01:22:35.008
It always ends the same for
you, doesn't it, Michael?


1759
01:22:36.845 --> 01:22:38.920
[dramatic music]

1760
01:22:39.014 --> 01:22:40.496
Michael died.

1761
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:42.757
He doesn't exist anymore.

1762
01:22:42.851 --> 01:22:44.351
Oh but his story does.

1763
01:22:45.595 --> 01:22:47.240
And it seems like
you like to replay it.


1764
01:22:47.264 --> 01:22:52.078
Over and over again, don't you?

1765
01:22:52.102 --> 01:22:53.102
Listen,

1766
01:22:55.197 --> 01:22:59.699
When I fall in love, I
bring 'em here, our home.


1767
01:23:01.686 --> 01:23:05.517
And I try to make
them understand.


1768
01:23:05.541 --> 01:23:07.874
That we can build a new world.

1769
01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:10.710
We have everything
we need right here.


1770
01:23:12.381 --> 01:23:13.381
Screw you.

01:23:20.614 --> 01:23:21.796
Let it out.

1774
01:23:21.948 --> 01:23:22.948
Let it out.

1775
01:23:24.042 --> 01:23:27.468
No one, no one can
hear you scream.

Shh, shh.

1779
01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:45.471
The gun.

[dramatic music]

1781
01:23:53.422 --> 01:23:54.422
You know what?

1782
01:23:55.315 --> 01:23:56.315
Yeah.

1783
01:23:57.408 --> 01:24:01.428
Maybe you and I and Olivia,

1784
01:24:01.655 --> 01:24:03.430
Maybe we can get
past our differences.


1785
01:24:06.268 --> 01:24:08.268
Yeah, I see it.

1786
01:24:11.498 --> 01:24:14.608
You both can bear my children.

1787
01:24:15.944 --> 01:24:18.612
[dramatic music]

1788
01:24:21.524 --> 01:24:23.858
I can love you both.

1791
01:24:31.017 --> 01:24:31.866
Big mistake.

Okay, I got you, I got you.

1796
01:24:41.637 --> 01:24:42.521
There you go.

1797
01:24:42.545 --> 01:24:43.545
Thank you.

1798
01:24:44.956 --> 01:24:46.859
[Olivia] thank you.

1799
01:24:46.883 --> 01:24:47.548
Oh my god.

[mad die vo]<i>so in a</i>
<i>strange, sad, bittersweet way,</i>


1803
01:25:06.569 --> 01:25:10.071
<i>The trauma of losing my
sister Abigail so long ago,</i>


1804
01:25:10.223 --> 01:25:11.503
<i>Prepared me to fight the danger.</i>

1805
01:25:11.725 --> 01:25:15.484
<i>That came to destroy our
community and our lives.</i>

01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:16.836
<i>These many years later.</i>

1807
01:25:18.415 --> 01:25:19.725
<i>I'm just grateful I've been
able to make a difference.</i>


1808
01:25:19.749 --> 01:25:21.675
<i>Through my investigative work.</i>

1809
01:25:21.902 --> 01:25:24.252
<i>And by learning to
trust my instinct.</i>


1810
01:25:24.513 --> 01:25:27.013
[gentle music]

1811
01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:30.736
So, this guy literally
sends us a selfie.


1812
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.330
Because he thought the mugshot,

1813
01:25:32.354 --> 01:25:33.998
We released to the
public, was unflattering.


1814
01:25:34.022 --> 01:25:35.096
[all laughing]

1815
01:25:35.248 --> 01:25:36.597
Wait, so what did you do?

1816
01:25:36.692 --> 01:25:38.169
Oh, we were able to pick
him up within the hour.


1817
01:25:38.193 --> 01:25:41.102
[all laughing]

1818
01:25:41.254 --> 01:25:42.415
Did you guys hear about the body.

1819
01:25:42.439 --> 01:25:44.030
That was found over in Madison?

1820
01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.585
Couple of the details line up.

1821
01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:49.444
With a john doe from a
case up in Knoxville.


1822
01:25:49.538 --> 01:25:50.445
[gentle music]

1823
01:25:50.539 --> 01:25:51.279
[birds chirping]

1824
01:25:51.431 --> 01:25:52.280
Hey.

1825
01:25:52.374 --> 01:25:53.759
[gentle music]

1826
01:25:53.783 --> 01:25:55.283
Wait, where are you going?

1827
01:25:55.435 --> 01:25:56.543
No.

1828
01:25:56.694 --> 01:25:58.119
I've already got
a working theory.


1829
01:25:58.271 --> 01:25:59.120
[jack] nope.

1830
01:25:59.214 --> 01:26:00.288
[gentle music]

1831
01:26:00.382 --> 01:26:01.382
[laughing]
