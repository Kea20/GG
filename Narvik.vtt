Sweden delivers 85% of the iron ore
used by the German weapons industry.

00:49.875 --> 00:54.666
The ore is transported by train across
the border and shipped out from Narvik.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.208
[dramatic music playing]

01:06.750 --> 01:09.583
Stopping the ore
transportation is considered

01:09.666 --> 01:12.375

of the utmost importance.

mined Norwegian waters.

No.

We're going back to base.

Take this.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.083
How did you manage that?

03:43.166 --> 03:44.125
I'm not a pack mule.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.750
Don't make me say it's an order.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.666

-than any other.
-[phone ringing]

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
And that's why, as you all know,
it is sought after all over the world.

04:18.083 --> 04:21.625
And today when we present
the plans for our new ore keep,

04:21.708 --> 04:23.500
you can see for yourselves

04:23.583 --> 04:27.083
that here, there will be
more than enough room for everyone.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.291
I guarantee it.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.916
[woman 1] Is there a problem?

04:31.000 --> 04:36.083
[man 1] German and English industry
have one thing in common with us

04:36.166 --> 04:38.166
here in little Narvik.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.416
You all profit greatly from the peace

04:41.500 --> 04:44.750
-and security of our harbor.
-[in German] …there is peace and security,

04:44.833 --> 04:47.875
-uh, in our harbor. And--
-And we are very happy about it.

04:48.625 --> 04:50.000
[man 1] But unfortunately,

04:50.083 --> 04:52.875
it has come to
my attention that several ships,

04:52.958 --> 04:54.833
both German and English,

04:54.916 --> 04:58.333
-have been sunk after leaving port.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.750
[man 1] This affects all of us.

05:02.833 --> 05:08.750
Since both German and English
representatives are present here today,

05:09.333 --> 05:13.583
I would ask you to speak with
your governments about an agreement

05:13.666 --> 05:17.791
guaranteeing that all
ships from all nations

05:17.875 --> 05:21.125
-can count on safe passage.
-Speak with their authorities…

05:21.208 --> 05:23.291
to secure safety for all ships,

05:23.375 --> 05:26.000
[in German] so that the ore
makes it safely to its destination.

05:26.083 --> 05:26.958
[in German] Well,

05:27.666 --> 05:29.708
your Mayor thinks too highly of me.

So you're finished now?

06:08.083 --> 06:10.000
Soon. [inhales]

06:10.083 --> 06:11.583
We were transferred here today.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.375
They say why?

06:14.458 --> 06:15.875
Yes.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.833
So I can be close to you, of course.

06:18.916 --> 06:20.250

to start the service now.

No, thank you.

07:58.916 --> 08:04.458
May I ask, did the German consul
share any thoughts on your Mayor's speech?

08:04.541 --> 08:05.416
With me?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.541
Hmm.

08:06.625 --> 08:09.875
No, he asked me to translate, that's all.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.083
Hm.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.041
I shouldn't give in
to all his requests, miss.

08:14.125 --> 08:17.625
Trust me, that is not
the best way to handle the German.

08:17.708 --> 08:20.291
[woman 2] We handle all guests
the same way, Mr. Ross.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.166

-[chuckling] Yes we do.

I cannot believe it.

14:22.625 --> 14:23.625
[Colonel yells] Pull back!

14:24.541 --> 14:26.375
Colonel, this is in violation of--

14:26.458 --> 14:30.166
I can't have the town blown into pieces.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.750
[indistinct muttering]

14:35.833 --> 14:37.541
[soldier 6] Aren't we going to fight?

14:39.958 --> 14:41.166
[indistinct chatter]

14:41.250 --> 14:43.375
-[soldier 7] Just follow orders.
-[soldier 6] Are they going to take it?

14:43.458 --> 14:45.916
-[soldier 6] Am I right?
-[soldier 7] Yeah, just come on.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.666
[dogs barking in distance]

14:57.416 --> 15:00.291
Okay. Let's take a left down here, boys.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.416
[soldier 8] We're not going back to camp?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.041
[Captain] No way in hell we are.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.291
[soldier 8] Are we… are we not?

15:11.375 --> 15:12.833
[soldier 9] What's going on?

15:12.916 --> 15:16.083
[dogs barking in distance]

15:17.916 --> 15:19.208
[soldier 8] I'm going home.

15:24.625 --> 15:28.208
[tense music playing]

15:28.291 --> 15:29.583
Where are you going?

15:30.375 --> 15:34.541
You know what the Germans
do to POWs? They shoot them.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.041
Magne, what are you doing?

15:41.416 --> 15:43.083
You're a soldier, for fuck's sake.

15:51.250 --> 15:56.333
[tense music swells and fades]

15:56.416 --> 16:00.708
-[birds chirping]
-[wind howling]

16:08.791 --> 16:10.000
Excuse me?

16:10.583 --> 16:13.083
Oh, you have to use the…
the main entrance.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.541
I can't use that
entrance anymore, I'm sorry.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.250
What's going on?

16:19.416 --> 16:22.083
Please, miss, it's um… it's rather urgent.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.125
[man 3] It's a matter of life and death.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.958
-Come with me.
-Thank you.

16:30.041 --> 16:33.708
[indistinct chatter]

16:33.791 --> 16:36.125
[soldier 9 in German] That one too!
Put him with the others!

16:36.208 --> 16:38.583
[in German] Down! Down!
To the reception desk!

16:38.666 --> 16:40.541
[indistinct commands in German]

16:40.625 --> 16:41.750
-[soldier 9] Keep moving!
-[soldier 10 in German] Get out!

16:41.833 --> 16:42.666
[soldier 10] Come on, hurry!

16:44.833 --> 16:46.541
[soldier 9] This way.

16:46.625 --> 16:48.333
[indistinct commands in German]

16:48.416 --> 16:49.375
-[soldier 10] Get down, down!
-[soldier 9] Stop!

16:49.458 --> 16:51.166
[soldier 11 in German] Give me
the Englishman's keys!

16:51.250 --> 16:52.541
[soldier 9] Come on, hurry up!

16:52.625 --> 16:54.625
[in German] Down, down!
To the reception desk.

16:54.708 --> 16:57.333
[in German] One second!
I need this young lady. As a translator.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.958
Mrs. Tofte, could you help us?

17:01.125 --> 17:03.375
We urgently need the key to room 503.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.500
They want the key to Ross' room.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.833
[woman 2] We don't give out
the keys of our guest.

17:07.916 --> 17:09.708
[in German] I'm sorry, there is
only one key for each room.

17:09.791 --> 17:12.958
Yes. And one that
fits everywhere. The-- The master key.

17:13.708 --> 17:15.083
[in German] The key! Now!

17:15.166 --> 17:17.166
[man 4 in German] No, no.
We come here as friends.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.458
To protect Norway from the English.

17:18.541 --> 17:21.625
So please be careful with your weapon.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.125
I understand.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.750
[man 4] You do? Good.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.916
[ominous music plays]

17:29.000 --> 17:30.791
But my husband is a soldier.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.458
Oh. Down at the harbor?

17:36.083 --> 17:37.125
No.

17:37.208 --> 17:41.416
The Norwegian Army
has laid down their arms.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.041
That means he's safe.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.708
[keys clattering]

17:52.208 --> 17:53.458
[man 4] Thank you.

17:54.958 --> 17:56.750
[soldier 11 in German] Walter,
you're coming with me.

17:56.833 --> 18:00.041
Alright, we-- we'd
like to take over all the rooms.

18:00.125 --> 18:02.000
[in English] He wants all the rooms.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.458
But our guests, what about them?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.750
The guests who need to move
out will be compensated, of course.

18:06.833 --> 18:09.958
One, two.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.916
That should be enough for now.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.791
And you will get a pay raise.

18:15.875 --> 18:18.958
[in German] No. No, thanks.
That's not necessary.

18:19.041 --> 18:20.291
Of course it is.

18:20.375 --> 18:24.458
I need someone who appreciates the value
of cooperation and who speaks German.

18:24.541 --> 18:27.166
-[soldier 10 whispering]
-Excuse me.

18:27.250 --> 18:31.500
[woman 2] Go help Bjørg in the kitchen,
people need breakfast.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.333
[in English] Hey, did I
do something wrong?

18:35.000 --> 18:35.958
No, you didn't.

18:36.041 --> 18:38.041
They were taking the keys no matter what.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.083
We can't control the conflict.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.416
So let's just try to run the hotel.

18:42.500 --> 18:48.083
[train wheels clanging]

18:59.416 --> 19:00.666
[in German] Halt! Stop there!

19:02.541 --> 19:04.333
Just keep on marching.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.458
[in German] What is going on, soldier?

19:13.541 --> 19:15.666
[in German] You're not
allowed to leave town.

19:16.708 --> 19:17.708
Why?

19:17.791 --> 19:20.458
You have to turn
around and go back to the barracks.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.125
You are not allowed to march here.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.500
Yes, we march.

19:31.583 --> 19:37.750
[tense music plays]

19:39.125 --> 19:41.083
[soldier 12 in German] Let them through?

19:43.958 --> 19:45.458
[soldier 13 in German] I'm ready.
Should I shoot?

19:51.666 --> 19:53.458
[in English] And we keep our eyes forward.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.166
[tense music ends]

20:03.791 --> 20:05.083
[Bjørg whispering] What should we do?

20:05.166 --> 20:06.875
The Germans are in the backyard.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.708
[knock on the door]

20:08.791 --> 20:10.541
[soldier 14 in German] Open
the door at once!

20:10.625 --> 20:11.833
-[banging on door]
-[tap running]

20:12.541 --> 20:14.208
[soldier 15 in German] Open up!

20:14.291 --> 20:15.500
[tense music plays]

20:15.583 --> 20:16.833
[soldier 14] Hello?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.291
-[knocking on door]
-[soldier 15] Open the door right now!

20:18.916 --> 20:20.625
[soldier 14] We know you're in there!

20:22.250 --> 20:24.291
There you go. Did you not here us?

20:25.500 --> 20:26.708
Move.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.958
[birds chirping]

20:31.041 --> 20:32.333
[tense music playing]

20:32.416 --> 20:33.583
[in German] Good morning.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.041
[soldier 14 in German] Morning.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.875
Please follow me. The coffee is ready.

20:44.250 --> 20:49.125
[tense music continues playing]

20:56.041 --> 20:57.625
Milk or sugar?

20:58.791 --> 20:59.833
Milk, please.

20:59.916 --> 21:00.958
For me too.

21:01.041 --> 21:02.125
[soldier 16 in German] Soldiers!

21:02.208 --> 21:04.833
-Come.
-[soldier 16] Everyone gather for an…

21:04.916 --> 21:08.458
[tense music playing]

21:10.625 --> 21:12.083
[in English] This way.

21:17.375 --> 21:21.333
[Mr. Ross] Wait. Wait.
We need your help, Mrs. Tofte.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.708
Am I given to
understand that you live nearby?

21:24.958 --> 21:26.000
I live--

21:27.000 --> 21:28.166
I didn't know what to say.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.083
I live across the backyard.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.208
The Germans will find you there.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.416
Nevertheless, we have nowhere else to be.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.500
I can't get involved. I have a child.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.416
[inhales softly]

21:39.500 --> 21:42.750
If you close this door on us,
we may well die.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.041
Is there anywhere else
we might go Mrs. Tofte?

21:47.125 --> 21:49.125
Not connected to you, of course.

21:52.250 --> 21:53.583
Oh, what about the hunting cabin?

21:54.666 --> 21:56.083
In the mountains?

21:56.666 --> 21:57.958
Bjørg will show you.

21:58.041 --> 21:59.625
Thank you very much.

22:02.041 --> 22:05.000
[man 3] It's just for a few days.
Our troops will arrive shortly.

22:07.125 --> 22:10.083
We are trusting
in your discretion, Mrs. Tofte.

22:10.166 --> 22:11.375
You can trust us.

22:15.541 --> 22:19.083
[birds chirping]

22:24.041 --> 22:25.291
We have to leave town.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.666
[Ole] Should I bring my boots?

22:26.750 --> 22:30.166
Yeah, bring your boots.
Have you heard what's going on?

22:30.875 --> 22:32.125
What about Gunnar?

22:32.208 --> 22:33.750
[Dad] He's left already.

22:33.833 --> 22:37.583
No. The Norwegian soldiers
are here, in Narvik.

22:37.666 --> 22:39.208
They've surrendered.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.583
There's a company
marching along the tracks.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.458
And Gunnar's with them?

22:46.791 --> 22:48.750
Do you think he would surrender?

22:50.375 --> 22:54.458
[tense music plays]

22:54.541 --> 22:59.958
[tense music playing]

23:07.291 --> 23:09.666
[chuckles softly]

23:09.750 --> 23:15.083
[tense music swells and ends]

23:26.750 --> 23:28.166
Did you make it back to camp last night?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.500
He was busy driving the toy train.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.041
[laughs]

23:34.166 --> 23:36.750
[man 7 in German] The ferry is closed.
Go back home.

23:36.833 --> 23:40.291
[man 8 in German] So now we're just
standing here gawking like idiots.

23:40.375 --> 23:46.250
[wistful music plays]

23:49.916 --> 23:51.541
Do you think he's Norwegian?

23:51.625 --> 23:56.250
Grandpa told me that they're from
the Norwegian ships that the Germans sunk.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.791
[birds chirping]

23:58.791 --> 24:00.291
[in German] What's happening?

24:00.375 --> 24:02.291
[in German] The ferry
is closed for civilians.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.625
No one is allowed to leave the town.

24:05.208 --> 24:09.708
If the Germans think they can close
off the city, they're in for a surprise.

24:09.791 --> 24:12.291
[wistful music playing]

24:13.541 --> 24:16.500
Ole, come on.

24:17.291 --> 24:21.833
[wistful music continues playing]

24:21.916 --> 24:23.250
Don't look.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.250
Did you get more?

24:31.333 --> 24:34.875
Corporal Tofte,
the Major wants to see you.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.333
[soldier 17] Jail time.

24:44.416 --> 24:45.750
[Major] It has to be here somewhere.

24:45.833 --> 24:46.916
[soldier 18] Yeah, that's strange.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.375
[Major] Maybe we're missing a page.

24:49.458 --> 24:50.791
Corporal Tofte reporting.

24:50.875 --> 24:55.208
Yes. I understand
you worked here on the Ofoten Line?

24:56.125 --> 24:59.666
Yes, I did.
Before I was on neutrality duty,

24:59.750 --> 25:01.833
-sir.
-[Major] We are no longer neutral.

25:01.916 --> 25:05.958
There's supposed to be some dynamite
here according to this plan. Where is it?

25:08.458 --> 25:09.916
I don't know, Major.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.291
This bridge was designed to be blown up,

25:12.375 --> 25:14.166
so there must be dynamite here.

25:15.666 --> 25:20.583
[train engine chugging]

25:27.166 --> 25:29.916
[man 9] Tofte, you've got a phonecall.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.333
Tofte.

25:38.333 --> 25:41.291
Hi dad. Can we speak freely?

25:41.375 --> 25:43.791
[train engine chugging]

25:43.875 --> 25:47.333
Yes, we can talk. Where are you, Gunnar?

25:48.916 --> 25:51.833
Do you know of any dynamite
stashed by the Nordal Bridge?

25:53.958 --> 25:57.625
There's a stash in the tunnel
that goes towards Sweden.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.333
On this side of the tunnel?

25:59.416 --> 26:02.875
[Dad] Yeah. The blast chambers
are in their third pillar.

26:02.958 --> 26:06.416
You'll need… three,
maybe four sticks of dynamite.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.625
I know, Dad.

26:07.708 --> 26:08.708
[Dad] Gunnar, listen.

26:09.583 --> 26:11.791
There's a train coming up the tracks.

26:11.875 --> 26:14.583
Ole and Ingrid are on it--

26:14.666 --> 26:16.166
[Major clears throat]

26:16.250 --> 26:18.541
So you are competent with explosives?

26:18.625 --> 26:19.708
I am Major.

26:19.791 --> 26:23.541
You bring your team, plant
the dynamite, and detonate immediately.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.708
[indistinct chatter]

26:25.791 --> 26:27.875
Shouldn't we let the train pass first?

26:28.750 --> 26:31.458
Do you understand
why we're blowing up this bridge?

26:31.541 --> 26:33.916
To keep the iron ore
from reaching Narvik, sir.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.083
The only reason the Germans are here

26:36.166 --> 26:38.333
is to get that ore
for their armored steel.

26:39.041 --> 26:40.333
-Understood.
-Yes.

26:40.416 --> 26:42.083
Then you understand that we can't risk the

26:42.166 --> 26:44.375
train having German troops onboard.

26:44.458 --> 26:49.250
[tense music playing]

26:57.333 --> 27:00.375
This is enough, right?

27:00.958 --> 27:03.375
That's all there was, Major.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.291
[yells] Movement in the tunnel!

27:06.375 --> 27:08.583
Positions! Blast it right away.

27:08.666 --> 27:10.541
[ominous music plays]

27:10.625 --> 27:12.125
[Major] Take cover.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.041
Blast chamber is at
the bottom of the third pillar!

27:28.875 --> 27:32.791
[suspenseful music playing]

27:46.750 --> 27:48.291
They're civilians.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.708
What?

27:50.916 --> 27:52.291
They're civilians!

27:54.500 --> 27:56.250
[Major] Hold your fire!

28:02.416 --> 28:03.708
[girl 1 yells] Daddy!

28:04.541 --> 28:06.333
[soldier 19 yells] Stay there, Grethe!

28:07.916 --> 28:10.541
Get them over the bridge.
Get them here. Quick!

Come on! Hurry!

-[heavy breathing]

28:39.583 --> 28:43.000
[suspenseful music playing]

28:45.000 --> 28:46.500
What happened to the train?

28:46.583 --> 28:49.583
The Germans stopped it, in Hundalen.

28:49.666 --> 28:50.833
Where are they now?

28:50.916 --> 28:55.166
I have no idea. They were still
at the station when we left.

28:55.250 --> 28:58.416
Into the tunnel. Get them into the tunnel.

29:00.375 --> 29:03.833
Just follow the tracks. It's okay. after
that tunnel, you're almost in Sweden.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.208
And what about you?

29:05.291 --> 29:07.500
[Major] Corporal,
we have to blast right now.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.166
-Yes, Major.
-Go!

29:10.416 --> 29:12.916
Run, Ole. I'm right you behind.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.375
-Are you?
-[Gunnar] Yes!

29:14.458 --> 29:16.791
[yells] Everyone fire on my command!

29:16.875 --> 29:21.791
[suspenseful music plays]

29:23.125 --> 29:25.708
[Gunnar] I told you
to use the blast chambers.

29:25.791 --> 29:26.708
Those?

29:27.625 --> 29:31.083
[Gunnar grunting]

29:31.166 --> 29:32.541
[Magne] We tried, there's no point.

29:32.625 --> 29:34.791
[panting]

29:34.875 --> 29:37.458
We won't have enough dynamite.

29:37.541 --> 29:39.250
Then what should we do?

29:41.541 --> 29:42.958
We need a charge up there.

29:47.625 --> 29:49.833
Take the rest and
attach them to the other side.

29:49.916 --> 29:51.333
-[Magne] Got it.
-[grunts]

29:51.416 --> 29:56.208

[breathing heavily]

30:11.833 --> 30:12.666
Come on.

30:12.750 --> 30:15.416
No, I don't want to,
I want to wait for daddy.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.416
But you heard what daddy said,
he's right behind us.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.750

[Major] Fire!

31:00.083 --> 31:01.500
[gunshots fired]

31:05.625 --> 31:08.208
-Don't think. Just aim and fire.
-[groaning]

31:11.041 --> 31:12.458

[soldiers in German] Across the bridge!
Go! Move it! Get over the bridge!

32:34.666 --> 32:35.875
[soldier 21 in German] After them!

33:15.458 --> 33:17.625
Is daddy coming now?

33:28.083 --> 33:29.458
[soldier 22 in German] Are you alone?

33:30.541 --> 33:32.541
[in German] Yes, we're alone.

33:32.625 --> 33:34.000
[soldier 22] Come with us.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.208
[soldier 23 in German] You
miserable saboteurs. You'll regret this.

33:40.291 --> 33:42.833
[somber music plays]

33:42.916 --> 33:44.291
[soldier 23 in German] Move along!

33:45.458 --> 33:48.208
[soldier 23 in German] Damn
Norwegian pig. You'll pay for that.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.041
[in German] What's happening to them?

33:50.125 --> 33:52.125
[in German] They're prisoners of war.

33:52.208 --> 33:56.875
They'll get their punishment.
They blew up the bridge.

34:01.166 --> 34:05.333
[somber music playing]

34:05.416 --> 34:06.791
[soldier 23 in German] Stop gawking.

34:12.166 --> 34:14.458
[soldier 23] What are you gawking at?
Eyes forward.

34:15.041 --> 34:16.333
[in German] Keep going, please.

34:20.083 --> 34:24.666
[somber music continues playing]

34:40.791 --> 34:42.541
-Grandpa!
-Ole!

34:43.708 --> 34:47.208
Seeing you makes Grandpa happy.
Tell me what happened.

34:47.291 --> 34:51.208
Daddy blew up the bridge
so it's now all crooked now.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.625
The bridge got crooked?

34:55.333 --> 34:57.708
[soldier 24 in German]
Stay right here. Understood?

34:57.791 --> 34:59.333
Is your daddy okay?

34:59.416 --> 35:00.750
-Yes.
-[soldier 24] Mrs. Tofte?

35:01.875 --> 35:03.916
Consul Wussow wants to see you.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.208
Yes.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.333
[indistinct chatter]

35:09.416 --> 35:13.583
[solemn music plays]

35:16.500 --> 35:17.541
[door closes]

35:17.625 --> 35:20.333
[in German] Mrs. Tofte,
thank you for coming.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.125
We're having trouble with the Mayor.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.625
[in German] We need to evacuate.

35:28.708 --> 35:30.208
-[in German] Evacuate?
-Yes.

35:30.291 --> 35:32.458
[in German] We are here to protect you.

35:32.541 --> 35:36.333
Oh, to protect us?
But many Norwegians are dead!

35:36.416 --> 35:39.875
Your men had the opportunity to
surrender and they chose not to.

35:39.958 --> 35:40.958
[in English] No. Ingrid,

35:41.041 --> 35:43.291
he might understand what I'm saying,
but not what I mean.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.750
-We need to evacuate.
-Right.

35:44.833 --> 35:48.416
[in German] Mr. Mayor,
let's start from the top again.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.416
You tried to send a telegraph,

35:50.500 --> 35:52.166
what did you want to achieve by it?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.416
You tried to telegraph and…

35:54.500 --> 35:55.625
they want to know
what you were trying to achieve.

35:55.708 --> 35:59.166
But I've been trying to tell them,
I wanted to warn the British.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.708
[in German] He wanted to warn the British.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.083
[in German] Warn them.

36:02.166 --> 36:03.000
[Wussow in German] About what?

36:03.083 --> 36:04.208
[in English] About what?

36:04.291 --> 36:05.875
[in English] That the town
is full of civilians.

36:05.958 --> 36:07.583
[in German] That the town
is full of civilians.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.083
-[Mayor in German] Yes.
-Hm.

36:09.916 --> 36:11.541
[in German] Which Englishman
did he talk to?

36:12.125 --> 36:15.583
-He asks who you were in contact with.
-No one, I didn't get that far.

36:15.666 --> 36:16.583
[in German] None.

36:16.666 --> 36:19.791
[in English] Yes. If you
refuse to let us evacuate,

36:19.875 --> 36:22.583
we'll be forced
to use the pedestrian tunnel as a shelter.

36:22.666 --> 36:25.291
We have a long tunnel

36:25.375 --> 36:27.541
that the Mayor wants
to use as an air-raid shelter.

36:27.625 --> 36:29.041
[in German] The English aren't coming.

36:29.125 --> 36:32.250
[Mayor] Oh? So then why
do we need their protection?

36:32.333 --> 36:34.166
Then why do you want to protect us?

36:34.958 --> 36:37.458
The English won't
come because we are here.

36:37.541 --> 36:39.083
[in English] The English won't come
if the Germans are here.

36:39.166 --> 36:42.458
[man 10 in German] For the good
of your people, we should cooperate.

36:42.541 --> 36:47.083
[in German] Oh, cooperate?
Our neutrality has been violated!

36:47.166 --> 36:48.666
[glasses shaking]

36:48.750 --> 36:50.500
[man 10] I'm not done with you yet.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.708
[in English] No. You can tell him
that I have another errand.

36:52.791 --> 36:57.041
[in German] We need the Mayor to
keep the town running. May I try again?

37:01.791 --> 37:02.958
One more thing.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.875
[Wussow] He's temperamental,
but can be reasoned with.

37:05.958 --> 37:11.125
[man 10 in German] Get the man
under control. We need 50 skilled workers.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.833
[glass shatters]

37:16.208 --> 37:17.666
[man 10] See to it.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.416
Go home now and try to get some rest.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.833
Yes.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.291
[door closes]

37:30.375 --> 37:31.750
[Wussow in German] Everything okay?

37:35.250 --> 37:38.291
[in German] My husband was
captured on the Nordal Bridge.

37:38.375 --> 37:39.250
Yes.

37:40.166 --> 37:43.000
I… I fear for his life.

37:44.375 --> 37:45.791
[chuckles]

37:45.875 --> 37:50.083
You have the wrong idea about us,
Mrs. Tofte. We aren't like that.

37:52.333 --> 37:57.833
But he was one of
those who blew up the bridge.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
I see.

38:05.791 --> 38:08.000
I will ask General Dietl about it.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.458
Thank you. Would you do that?

38:12.541 --> 38:13.708
Of course.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.000
I will emphasize how
important your work is to us.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.666
His name is Gunnar Tofte.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.791
Okay.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.166
Thanks.

38:27.791 --> 38:30.958
[toy train whirring]

38:31.041 --> 38:32.541
Yeah, that's it.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.458
It's Bjørg.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.791
-[Dad] Oops.
-It's working!

38:46.500 --> 38:47.833
Just go on in.

38:50.041 --> 38:51.166
Let me have a look.

38:53.875 --> 38:55.291
I'm sorry to intrude.

38:57.666 --> 39:02.041
It's our friends from room 503.
They've asked for you to visit.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.000
What for?

39:04.083 --> 39:05.500
To bring this to them.

39:08.375 --> 39:10.166
Why can't you do it?

39:10.250 --> 39:13.958
They insisted on you,
and it has to be today.

39:14.041 --> 39:17.791
[birds chirping]

39:17.875 --> 39:20.958
[Ingrid] No, they'll be
fine without tobacco.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.416
If you don't help, it becomes my problem.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.625
You're the one who
told me to take them to the cabin.

39:29.708 --> 39:31.750
You can't just dump everything on me.

39:31.833 --> 39:35.791
[tense music plays]

39:38.458 --> 39:41.833
[soldier 25 in German] Good morning,
General Dietl. Your car is ready.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.750
[General Dietl in German] Drive me down to
the pier, I'm meeting with Admiral Bontar.

39:43.833 --> 39:46.916
[soldier 25] Yes, sir.
The attaché is here already.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
[tense music plays]

39:49.583 --> 39:50.750
[soldier 25] General.

40:12.125 --> 40:16.875
[pensive music plays]

40:32.541 --> 40:36.041
[sighs]

40:39.333 --> 40:42.208
Miss. Bjørg tells me you are
still interpreting for the Germans.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.000
Yes, um…

40:46.083 --> 40:48.291
I guess I don't have a choice.

40:48.375 --> 40:52.208
There is an intimacy about that,
being an interpreter.

40:52.791 --> 40:54.083
What do you mean?

40:55.666 --> 40:58.583
[Mr. Ross] The German consul,
he's clearly attracted to you.

40:58.666 --> 41:03.000
[breaths deeply] Well…
it's… it's not mutual.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.541
[Mr. Ross] You put yourself in a…

41:10.625 --> 41:12.333
precarious position,

41:12.416 --> 41:14.583
telling him of your husband's captivity.

41:15.416 --> 41:18.708
Unless of course you… plan to seduce him.

41:19.416 --> 41:21.125
[sighs scornfully]

41:21.208 --> 41:23.000
You have to ask someone else.

41:24.125 --> 41:25.625
Someone who does that kind of thing.

41:25.708 --> 41:30.125
We have no one better placed
than you to gain the Germans' trust.

41:30.208 --> 41:34.875
No! I'm sorry, consul. Goodbye.

41:34.958 --> 41:36.791
[man 3] Wait! Wait. [exhales]

41:36.875 --> 41:41.000
We truly do not mean
to scare Mrs. Tofte. We need you.

41:41.083 --> 41:44.958
If you reject us, we must assume
you'll pledge alliance with the enemy.

41:45.041 --> 41:45.875
[scoffs]

41:45.958 --> 41:49.041
Why would you think that?
I helped you escape.

41:49.125 --> 41:51.416
Yes. Yes, you did.

41:52.041 --> 41:54.625
And the Germans
would not take kindly toward you

41:54.708 --> 41:56.500
if they suspected as much.

41:56.583 --> 41:59.208
[ominous music plays]

41:59.291 --> 42:01.791
Well, who would tell them?

42:02.625 --> 42:05.291
No one. Possibly.

42:06.250 --> 42:10.500
We need one another, Mrs. Tofte.
Can we count on you?

42:14.750 --> 42:20.541
We need to know where the German
artillery positions are hidden in town.

42:20.625 --> 42:26.083
[Mr. Ross] It's not the German fleet
out here that worries us, Mrs. Tofte.

42:26.166 --> 42:28.958
We have the world's most powerful navy.

42:29.041 --> 42:33.041
But our lads cannot
come ashore to liberate Narvik,

42:33.125 --> 42:38.958
unless you find out from Wussow precisely
how they plan to defend the city.

42:39.041 --> 42:44.000
[anticipatory music plays]

42:44.083 --> 42:45.625
[indistinct chatter]

42:45.708 --> 42:47.083
[in German] Put it over here.

42:47.166 --> 42:48.791
[in German] But when it has been restored
and the trains are running again,

42:49.541 --> 42:52.041
we're faced with the next problem,
the harbor needs to be operational.

42:52.125 --> 42:54.958

come on. Come on, guys. Let's go.

1:00:02.916 --> 1:00:05.083
[Magne] Gunnar, we have to leave.

1:00:05.166 --> 1:00:09.000

1:01:41.291 --> 1:01:46.458
[in French] It's okay, guys.
It's okay. He's with us.

1:01:47.666 --> 1:01:49.916
-Ah, thank you.
-[soldier 35 in French] Who is he?

1:01:50.625 --> 1:01:53.166
Well done. Pierre.

1:02:23.625 --> 1:02:25.250
Norwegian?

1:02:32.458 --> 1:02:33.708
[Gunnar grunting]

1:02:33.791 --> 1:02:35.083
[soldier 36] Are you injured?

[Major] Okay, bring them
down to the camp right away.

1:03:12.208 --> 1:03:13.250
[soldier 37] Yes sir.

1:03:15.625 --> 1:03:17.916
[Major] You're sure
the Germans fled the mountain?

1:03:19.541 --> 1:03:21.875
-[soldier 37] Major.
-[Major] Something to report?

1:03:21.958 --> 1:03:24.791
[soldier 37] Two dead Germans
at the machine gun post.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:27.083
Both shot by Corporal Tofte.

1:03:27.166 --> 1:03:28.250
[Major] Yeah.

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.083
The guy who told you that story,
is he here?

1:03:31.166 --> 1:03:32.000
[POW 3] No.

1:03:33.791 --> 1:03:37.625
I didn't know it
was your father, my condolences.

1:03:38.333 --> 1:03:42.750
Corporal, all this was very well done.

1:03:44.583 --> 1:03:45.875
I must get to Narvik.

1:03:45.958 --> 1:03:48.250
Yeah, you'll be there
soon fighting like that.

1:03:48.333 --> 1:03:50.000
[soldier 32 in French] Come on.

1:03:50.083 --> 1:03:51.625
But when?

1:03:51.708 --> 1:03:54.125
Well, when all the Germans are gone.

1:03:54.208 --> 1:03:56.500
May go quicker now that
we have the French are helping

1:03:56.583 --> 1:03:58.791
and even the Polish from the south.

1:04:02.750 --> 1:04:04.541
-I need to go home now.
-[Major] Yeah.

1:04:04.625 --> 1:04:05.875
Then you must fight.

1:04:07.833 --> 1:04:12.625
Corporal, you have
a little boy, don't you?

1:04:12.708 --> 1:04:16.750
[somber music playing]

1:04:16.833 --> 1:04:18.791
I don't know if he's alive.

1:04:21.375 --> 1:04:22.875
You need to believe in it.

1:04:23.958 --> 1:04:26.250
Believe that we'll
soon be standing in Narvik.

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:28.416
Then you can look
your kid in the eye and know

1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:30.666
he'll be growing up in a free land.

1:04:32.166 --> 1:04:35.041
Come on. Come on. Up you go.

1:04:36.416 --> 1:04:38.666
This is what we're fighting for.

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:42.208
We're Norwegians
and we fight for each other.

1:04:43.041 --> 1:04:44.666
[soldiers] Yes!

1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:50.208
[somber music swells]

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:56.916
NARVIK, 1 WEEK LATER

1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:00.833
Civilians are caught in the crossfire

1:05:00.916 --> 1:05:05.125
between German positions
and British ships.

1:05:05.208 --> 1:05:07.208
[somber music plays]

1:05:07.291 --> 1:05:10.875
[baby crying in the distance]

1:05:11.458 --> 1:05:12.916
Hold still.

1:05:16.041 --> 1:05:17.541
Ow!

1:05:17.625 --> 1:05:19.416
Does it hurt?

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:20.541
Yes.

1:05:21.458 --> 1:05:26.041
[somber music plays softly]

1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:29.416
Hold.

1:05:31.541 --> 1:05:33.833
Ah! Hey. We talked about this.

1:05:33.916 --> 1:05:36.166
[baby crying in the distance]

1:05:37.250 --> 1:05:38.541
There.

1:05:40.041 --> 1:05:42.333
Ingrid, I have to talk to you.

1:05:44.916 --> 1:05:45.750
[Ingrid] What's going on?

1:05:45.833 --> 1:05:48.250
[Bjørg whispers] It's the Germans.
They're going door to door,

1:05:48.333 --> 1:05:50.708
asking who's hiding the English.

1:05:50.791 --> 1:05:52.500
Did you told anyone?

1:05:52.583 --> 1:05:55.125
No, but now they're asking for you.

1:05:56.041 --> 1:05:57.125
To interpret?

1:05:57.208 --> 1:05:58.125
I don't know.

1:05:58.708 --> 1:06:03.000
You have to go. I'll stay here Ole.

1:06:11.833 --> 1:06:15.041
[somber music playing]

1:06:29.083 --> 1:06:33.125
[in German] My superiors want
to ration the food further.

1:06:33.208 --> 1:06:34.666
They want to cut the rations.

1:06:35.375 --> 1:06:38.875
No. People are starving. I won't do it.

1:06:38.958 --> 1:06:41.666
[in German] The people are
starving. We need food.

1:06:41.750 --> 1:06:44.708
I know. It's only until
they find the British Consul.

1:06:44.791 --> 1:06:47.833
Those who are helping the English
now are putting everyone else in danger.

1:06:47.916 --> 1:06:49.291
Do you understand?

1:06:49.375 --> 1:06:51.958
[in English] Well he says it's just till
they find the English consul and it's

1:06:52.041 --> 1:06:53.625
-just--
-[Mayor] I don't know where the consul is.

1:06:53.708 --> 1:06:55.541
[in German] Consul Wussow, I need to ask
you to please follow me to the basement.

1:06:55.625 --> 1:06:56.541
Yes.

1:06:57.333 --> 1:06:58.708
We need to go to the basement.

1:06:58.791 --> 1:07:00.958
I don't want to go
with a bunch of Germans.

1:07:01.750 --> 1:07:04.125
They have lost
their homes and their families.

1:07:04.208 --> 1:07:05.916
He needs to
understand that it's your people

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.750
who are suffering the most
under the British air raids.

1:07:07.833 --> 1:07:09.708
He says we, the people of Narvik,

1:07:09.791 --> 1:07:11.541
suffer the most from the British bombing.

1:07:11.625 --> 1:07:15.541
-[bomb explodes]
-[screaming]

1:07:17.666 --> 1:07:18.583
[in German] Where is consul Ross?

1:07:18.666 --> 1:07:20.000
[in German] I don't know.

1:07:20.083 --> 1:07:22.875
[in English] And if I did know,
I probably wouldn't tell you.

1:07:22.958 --> 1:07:24.916
[Wussow in German] I can give
you one more day,

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.250
then you have to tell us who it is that's
providing the English with intelligence.

1:07:28.333 --> 1:07:30.041
Otherwise you will be
charged with high treason.

1:07:30.125 --> 1:07:33.208
They'll charge you with treason
if they don't show up tomorrow.

1:07:33.291 --> 1:07:35.333
[bells ringing]

1:07:35.416 --> 1:07:36.541
[Wussow in German] It's dangerous outside.

1:07:36.625 --> 1:07:38.958
You should stay
the night here at the hotel.

1:07:40.083 --> 1:07:41.541
[in German] I have to go to my son.

1:07:42.291 --> 1:07:45.000
For his sake,
you should think of your own safety.

1:07:47.625 --> 1:07:50.250
He has nightmares because of the bombs.

1:07:50.333 --> 1:07:53.875
I see. I only have
nightmares during the day.

1:07:55.083 --> 1:07:58.625
Mm. And the days keep getting longer.

1:08:01.333 --> 1:08:03.958
A few more weeks
and there will be no more nights.

1:08:23.083 --> 1:08:24.375
How did it go?

1:08:25.041 --> 1:08:26.250
Hi, honey.

1:08:28.625 --> 1:08:31.083
When did you last speak to the English?

1:08:31.166 --> 1:08:32.166
Yesterday.

1:08:33.041 --> 1:08:35.041
We'll they blow up
the whole town before they get here?

1:08:35.125 --> 1:08:36.458
They'll come soon.

1:08:38.958 --> 1:08:40.416
Soon?

1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:41.458
Yeah.

1:08:41.541 --> 1:08:44.958
Mom, I'm bleeding.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:46.666
I checked, he's not bleeding.

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:51.250
I know. He has these nightmares.

[soldiers yelling in the distance]

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.333
[in German] I'm sorry, consul,
she insisted.

1:10:43.166 --> 1:10:44.875
[Ingrid in German] Get the doctor.

1:10:44.958 --> 1:10:49.125
-[in German] Mrs. Tofte. What happened?
-Right away, please.

1:10:49.208 --> 1:10:51.500
His wound's got badly infected.

1:10:52.666 --> 1:10:55.750

1:10:55.833 --> 1:10:58.208
[sighs]

1:10:59.583 --> 1:11:03.500
We have countless
seriously injured soldiers.

1:11:04.541 --> 1:11:08.875
And the doctor is under orders
to take care of them first. I am sorry.

1:11:09.541 --> 1:11:11.291
But I work for you.

1:11:11.375 --> 1:11:12.666
I know.

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:15.083
He is all I have. Please!

1:11:15.166 --> 1:11:17.791
But you don't understand.

1:11:17.875 --> 1:11:20.791
I can't go over the heads of
the commanders. It is a military issue.

1:11:24.708 --> 1:11:26.041
[exhales]

1:11:27.458 --> 1:11:29.708
I know where the consul is.

1:11:32.125 --> 1:11:33.500
Pardon?

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.291
I know where the Englishmen are.

-Is Ingrid here?
-Please wait in the lobby.

1:12:21.333 --> 1:12:22.541
But it's really important.

1:12:23.125 --> 1:12:28.333
[Bjørg] Ingrid?
What's going on? Is he sick?

1:12:29.666 --> 1:12:31.166
He's going to be fine.

1:12:32.750 --> 1:12:34.125
[Bjørg] Can I talk to you?

1:12:35.416 --> 1:12:36.583
Not now.

1:12:36.666 --> 1:12:38.666
-[in German] That's enough.
-[Bjørg] It can't wait.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.541
-What is it?
-[whispers] They've been caught.

1:12:44.625 --> 1:12:45.750
[whispers] How do you know that?

1:12:45.833 --> 1:12:47.291
There were German at the cabin.

1:12:47.375 --> 1:12:49.000
[Ingrid] Did they see you?

1:12:49.083 --> 1:12:51.541
[doctor in German] You have
to do it carefully.

1:12:51.625 --> 1:12:53.083
Make sure that he stays still.

1:12:57.250 --> 1:13:00.875
[solemn music playing]

1:13:00.958 --> 1:13:02.791
How were you able to get a doctor here?

1:13:04.875 --> 1:13:06.791
Bjørg, look at me.

1:13:10.208 --> 1:13:12.291
I didn't say you helped me hide them.

1:13:21.958 --> 1:13:24.208
[doctor in German] Look.
Two millimeters to the right

1:13:24.291 --> 1:13:25.500
and it would have hit his lung.

1:13:25.583 --> 1:13:26.916

1:32:28.750 --> 1:32:30.375
You wanna come and celebrate?

1:32:31.333 --> 1:32:32.750
I'm not allowed.

1:32:33.750 --> 1:32:35.416
Of course you're allowed.

1:32:37.375 --> 1:32:38.875
Why wouldn't you be?

1:32:38.958 --> 1:32:41.541
Polly said that we need to leave town.

1:32:41.625 --> 1:32:43.916
Right. We have to leave town.

1:32:49.708 --> 1:32:51.333
I ran into Bjørg.

1:32:53.625 --> 1:32:55.458
Have you heard the rumor she's spreading?

1:32:57.708 --> 1:33:00.333
[splutters] I can… I can…
I can explain it to you but not now.

1:33:01.125 --> 1:33:02.208
Why can't you?

1:33:02.291 --> 1:33:03.666
Please, Gunnar.

1:33:04.375 --> 1:33:05.916
-Do you want to bring the train?
-Yes.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:07.583
What did you do with the Germans?

1:33:09.125 --> 1:33:10.708
I did what I had to do.

1:33:13.041 --> 1:33:14.416
What's that?

1:33:16.333 --> 1:33:18.291
He was dying.

1:33:19.916 --> 1:33:21.125
Do you want to show daddy your scar?

1:33:23.458 --> 1:33:24.583
-[Gunnar] No.
-Look!

1:33:24.666 --> 1:33:26.291
Ole, you don't have to show me anything.

1:33:26.375 --> 1:33:28.625
Have you been with a German?

1:33:32.375 --> 1:33:34.291
No.

1:33:36.208 --> 1:33:38.291
Then why are you running away? Tell me!

1:33:39.166 --> 1:33:41.083
Because I gave up the English.

1:33:44.708 --> 1:33:46.208
That's not true.

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:48.375
It is.

1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:52.458
They're on our side.

1:33:53.208 --> 1:33:54.875
They weren't on my side.

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.708
I wouldn't be standing
here today if it were not for them.

1:33:59.791 --> 1:34:02.208
Then look at where you are standing!

1:34:03.083 --> 1:34:05.708
Ole almost died from an English grenade.

1:34:06.791 --> 1:34:09.125
And it was the same
grenade that killed your dad!

1:34:09.208 --> 1:34:11.041
That must have been an accident!

1:34:11.833 --> 1:34:13.375
And that's not a reason to switch sides.

1:34:14.250 --> 1:34:18.000
-You don't understand.
-What Ingrid? That you're a traitor!?

1:34:18.083 --> 1:34:19.208
Who have I betrayed?

1:34:19.291 --> 1:34:21.875
Us! The ones who defended you.

1:34:21.958 --> 1:34:26.458
Then who was here defending Ole?
While all of you were out there fighting?

1:34:28.208 --> 1:34:29.458
Should I just have let him die?

1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:35.875
[Gunnar] Ingrid, this is war. People die!

1:34:40.125 --> 1:34:44.708
It would have been better
if you never came back!

1:34:47.541 --> 1:34:50.750
[Ingrid] Ole, are you ready? Come on.

1:34:50.833 --> 1:34:53.208
[sighs]

1:34:55.750 --> 1:34:57.291
[plane whirring]

1:35:06.750 --> 1:35:10.250
[bombs exploding]

1:35:17.166 --> 1:35:22.000
[screaming in the distance]

1:35:23.791 --> 1:35:25.583
[Ole] I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding!

1:35:25.666 --> 1:35:27.458
-You're not… you're not bleeding.
-[Ole yells]

1:35:27.541 --> 1:35:29.750
-[Ole yells]
-Hey stop! Stop!

1:35:29.833 --> 1:35:31.666
-Hey. You're not bleeding.
-[Ole groans]

1:35:31.750 --> 1:35:35.583
[shushes]

1:35:36.625 --> 1:35:38.916
[plane whirring]

1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:40.458
[shushes]

1:35:45.666 --> 1:35:48.000
Now we see how
the Germans thank you for helping.

1:35:49.208 --> 1:35:51.583
[bomb explodes]

1:35:51.666 --> 1:35:55.500
[screaming in the distance]

1:35:56.458 --> 1:36:02.041
[screaming in the distance]

1:36:02.125 --> 1:36:04.375
[man 13] Præstnes, get down!

1:36:04.458 --> 1:36:08.666
[Præstnes screams]

1:36:09.291 --> 1:36:11.458
[screaming in the distance]

1:36:12.666 --> 1:36:13.750
Gunnar?

1:36:25.708 --> 1:36:31.000
Hey, it's too late. He's dead.

1:36:33.041 --> 1:36:34.291
He's gone.

1:36:38.166 --> 1:36:43.583
[tense music plays]

1:36:46.166 --> 1:36:48.333
[Magne] Why didn't we
return fire at their planes?

1:36:48.416 --> 1:36:50.833
[Major] It's the English who
are defending the airspace.

1:36:50.916 --> 1:36:52.416
[Magne] But there aren't
any English ships in the fjord.

1:36:53.250 --> 1:36:56.583
[Major] If the English have left,
it's to defend their homeland.

1:36:57.333 --> 1:37:03.541
[somber music plays]

1:37:03.625 --> 1:37:06.166
[man 14] Is it true that
Hitler has taken France?

1:37:09.458 --> 1:37:14.625
Fight for everything
you hold dear and die if you must.

1:37:20.708 --> 1:37:22.458
Private Præstnes did just that.

1:37:22.541 --> 1:37:24.333
He died for everything he held dear.

1:37:24.416 --> 1:37:27.166
A sacrifice he made
for us standing here now.

1:37:27.250 --> 1:37:31.000
We are Norwegians
and we fight for each other.

1:37:31.083 --> 1:37:32.375
And now more than ever

1:37:32.458 --> 1:37:36.125
we need those of you who are
willing to sacrifice themselves.

1:37:36.208 --> 1:37:39.625
Who are willing to sacrifice
everything for what they hold dear.

1:37:39.708 --> 1:37:40.708
[man 14] Yes.

1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:46.208
[dramatic music plays]

1:38:08.333 --> 1:38:12.166
[indistinct chatter]

1:38:13.583 --> 1:38:14.625
Where is the camp?

1:38:14.708 --> 1:38:16.666
It's up the road to the right.

1:38:16.750 --> 1:38:18.125
[man 15] Where can I find a weapon?

1:38:18.208 --> 1:38:19.416
[man 16] The camp's in the woods.

1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:20.625
[plane whirring]

1:38:20.708 --> 1:38:23.666
[man 17] German planes!

1:38:23.750 --> 1:38:24.916
[man 17] Planes!

1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:26.958
[plane whirring]

1:38:27.041 --> 1:38:28.500
Come onboard.

1:38:28.583 --> 1:38:30.583
[woman 4] Don't just stand there. Move.

1:38:30.666 --> 1:38:32.625
-[woman 5] They are coming back.
-Out of my way.

1:38:33.958 --> 1:38:35.916
[man 18] You don't belong here.

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.958
[woman 6] Come on, hurry.

1:38:38.041 --> 1:38:39.375
[sad music plays]

1:38:39.958 --> 1:38:42.041
[woman 7] Let's move forward.

1:38:42.125 --> 1:38:45.625
-[woman 7] Do you need help or something?
-[woman 6] Get some Germans to help you.

1:38:45.708 --> 1:38:51.416
[sad music playing]

1:39:22.916 --> 1:39:28.291
[solemn music playing]

1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:49.791
[indistinct chatter]

1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:00.416
[solemn music continues playing]

1:40:55.125 --> 1:41:00.458
[solemn music playing]

1:41:07.291 --> 1:41:11.958
Local fishing boats succeeded
in evacuating the remaining civilians

1:41:12.041 --> 1:41:18.250
before German bombers
left the city in ruins.

1:41:20.541 --> 1:41:26.000
[solemn music playing]

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:36.291
The recapture of Narvik is considered
Hitler's first defeat in world war II.

1:41:37.333 --> 1:41:42.583
But the victory was brief.

1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:50.375
[solemn music playing]

1:41:55.500 --> 1:42:01.333
Without informing Norway, Great Britain
and France ordered a full withdrawal.

1:42:03.333 --> 1:42:07.208
[solemn music playing]

1:42:12.041 --> 1:42:15.333
Norwegian forces were left alone
and forced to lay down their weapons

1:42:15.416 --> 1:42:19.791
on June 8th 1940.

1:42:33.291 --> 1:42:39.208
The battle of Narvik
is the largest battle on Norwegian soil.

1:43:03.583 --> 1:43:09.916
[solemn music playing]

1:44:00.458 --> 1:44:05.791
