you because your side

70
00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:15.123

Yes, we do, we do
have rattlesnakes.

76
00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.903
You know what? I have a pet
rattlesnake and I kiss it,

77
00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.773
and then I kiss your mommy
in her naughty place.

78

79
00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.644

You're not gonna
smile again, ever.

81
00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:48.488
Hey, who are you with?

82
00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:49.356
Hello?

83
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:51.959
Hey.
- Hm, what?

84
00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:55.863
- You, who brought in?

85
00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:57.430
- Brought me in?

86
00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.268
- Somebody take care
of this perp, please.

87
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.171
And locate Field Agent Jackson.

88
00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:05.405
- I am Field Agent Jackson.

89
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:13.380
Yeah, I get that a lot.

90
00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:16.250
- Well, let's hope
looks are deceiving.

91
00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:18.820
I'm Case Officer Connolly,
this is my office.

92
00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:19.452
Get in it.

93
00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:25.760
Jackson, I have a problem,

94
00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:27.595
which means now
you have a problem.

95
00:05:28.563 --> 00:05:30.298
There's a cartel kingpin
south of the border.

96
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.267
He's a friend because
nothing really

97
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:34.869
makes any sense anymore.

98
00:05:35.837 --> 00:05:37.839
So, the truckloads
of pure uncut cocaine

99
00:05:37.872 --> 00:05:41.309
he is trafficking in our
country, not a problem.

100
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.710
This entrepreneur however,

101
00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:45.445
has branched out into
black-market medical supplies,

102
00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.448
and that is not bueno.

103
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.617
- No esta bien.

104
00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:53.988
- See, our friend is pissing off

105
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.957
some really scary people now.

106
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.160
- Who's scarier than
the Mexican cartel?

107
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:00.561
- American big Pharma.

108
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.395
- Oh.

109
00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:06.334
Who do we work for again?

110
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.336
- Contraband's already
in the country.

111
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.469
They don't want it in Vegas.

112
00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:10.338
Vegas is a hub.

113
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.006
Spreads out from Vegas.

114
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.275
Remember the not bueno thing?

115
00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:15.576
That's where you come in,

116
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.246
'cause I am told that you
like to do a lotta leg work.

117
00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.715
- You know this
is all BS, right?

118
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:23.918
- I do.
- Hm.

119
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:25.620
- And I don't care anymore.

120
00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:30.423
What about you, Jackson?

121
00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:32.660
Do you care anymore?

122
00:06:33.928 --> 00:06:35.296
- I just
spent the last year

123
00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.463
and a half working the border.

124
00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.899
It's nearly six a.m.

125
00:06:37.932 --> 00:06:40.868
I'm just a tough ol' dog
looking for a bone to chew on.

126
00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:43.938
I couldn't give a damn.

127
00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:46.439
- Well, looks like
you're my girl.

128
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.114
- Yay, me.

129
00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.858
- Oh, hey bud.

130
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.692
- Hey, Mom.

131
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:09.563
I made cereal already.

132
00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:11.666
- We have milk?

133
00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.704
- Mm hm.

134
00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:20.508
- That's debatable.

135
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:23.978
- Grandma said a
curse word yesterday.

136
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:24.845
- Oh, yeah?

137
00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:27.048
What'd she say?

138
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.684
- I'm not falling
for that.

139
00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:31.319
- Get your PT's?

140
00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:32.153
- Mm hm.

141
00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:33.321
- You take your enzymes?

142
00:07:33.354 --> 00:07:34.355
- Mm hm.

143
00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:36.757
- All right, you
get one free pass.

144
00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:39.560
- She said dumb ass.

145
00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:42.430
- Did she call you a
dumb ass or grandpa?

146
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.496
- Grandpa.

147
00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.634
- Well, can't argue
with the facts.

148
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.046
Ugh, I think this milk
went bad a long time ago.

149
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.480
- Hm.

150
00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:01.315
- You do your homework?

151
00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.350
- Mm hm.

152
00:08:02.383 --> 00:08:03.217
- Okay.

153
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:06.587
- Those came in this morning.

154
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:18.432
- I like this shirt on you.

155
00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:20.001
- Thanks.
- Matches your eyes.

156
00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:36.183
- Whoa, hey.

157
00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:37.852
Hey, doofus, put that down.

158
00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:39.587
You're gonna throw
your back out.

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:53.434

182
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.161
- Bro, I'm tellin' you,

183
00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:22.096
I'm so done with these
stupid commercials.

184
00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:23.264
It's killin' my image.

185
00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:24.398
Should be starring
in the movies,

186
00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:26.400
not high ho and west
in the desert here.

187
00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:28.269
It's dry, man.

188
00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:29.470
Just get it done, all right?

189
00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:31.138
I'm tired of talking about this.

190
00:09:42.517 --> 00:09:43.350
- Heads up.

191
00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:48.856
You gotta take a bow.

192
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:58.099
- Come on.

193
00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.201
- Okay.

194
00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:01.168
Hear me out.

195
00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.236
- Uh huh?

196
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.772
- I'm thinking, I stay
with the compound set up,

197
00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:08.609
but get this, with
a '72 and a '91.

198
00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:10.244
I mean, how cool would that be?

199
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:12.581
- Yeah, really cool,

200
00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:13.881
if you like lag.

201
00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:15.816
- Mm, not as much
as I like boost.

202
00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:18.319
What do ya think?

203
00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:20.387
You up for installing it?

204
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:21.655
I'll make it worth your while.

205
00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:24.125
- I told you already, I
don't want your money.

206
00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:27.294
Working on a truck like this
is all the reward that I need.

207
00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:30.599
Besides, I'm startin' to
feel like you're an addict

208
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:32.500
and I'm some sort of enabler.

209
00:10:32.534 --> 00:10:33.634
- 50/50.

210
00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.269
Split all racing wins.

211
00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:36.837
And that is my final offer

212
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.005
and only because
you're my best friend.

213
00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.406
- Because I'm your best friend?

214
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.308
- Mm hm.
- Okay, look, I'm on to you.

215
00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:42.544
You're only offering me half

216
00:10:42.577 --> 00:10:44.613
because you want to race
twice as often, right?

217
00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:46.480
Come on, tell me I'm right.

218
00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:47.748
Come on.

219
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.251
Huh?
- All right, fine, maybe.

220
00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:51.085
But is that a yes?

221
00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:20.014
What are you doing?

222
00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:25.920
- Thought I heard an owl.

223
00:11:25.953 --> 00:11:27.922
It's a bad omen
south of the border.

224
00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:33.827
Lechuza, they say she's a
shape-shifting witch looking

225
00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.263
for revenge on the
people who wronged her.

226
00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:39.534
- Funny.

227
00:11:39.568 --> 00:11:41.001
Okay, can we do this already?

228
00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:43.103
- Such a hurry.

229
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.140
You want to have a
look around the place?

230
00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:47.975
- Somebody's got to
keep the world spinning.

231
00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:48.842
- Yeah.

232
00:11:49.678 --> 00:11:52.146
You know, some people would say

233
00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:56.016
you're wary of being
associated with me.

234
00:11:57.017 --> 00:11:58.953
- Hm, a black-market
medical supply dealer

235
00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.788
hiding out in the desert?

236
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:03.490
What could I possibly
be afraid of?

237
00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:05.859
Besides, you know I roll alone.

238
00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:07.696
- I do.

239
00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:09.564
A fiercely independent woman.

240
00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:10.699
- Fierce.

241
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:12.166
Well, you try dealing
with a deadbeat ex

242
00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:14.001
who splits as soon as
you get knocked up,

243
00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:16.070
and not getting a little fierce.

244
00:12:16.103 --> 00:12:18.472
- I guess some men just
aren't made for manhood.

245
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.246
Here, look, a free
gift for the kid.

246
00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:29.483
Think of this as a reward
for all your business.

247
00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:36.957
- Uh, Shelby is a boy.

248
00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:38.092
He doesn't play with dolls.

249
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.960
- Oh, boys can't
play with dolls?

250
00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:43.163
- Look, this is a marionette.

251
00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:45.899
- No, that's a puppet, and a
particularly ugly one at that.

252
00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.002
- You know what? Just take it.

253
00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.673
- You really are the weirdest
outlaw in the world, Renzo.

254
00:12:51.706 --> 00:12:53.907
- Yeah?
- You know that, right?

255
00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:55.543
- Okay, well, exactly
how many other outlaws

256
00:12:55.577 --> 00:12:56.678
are you acquainted with?

257
00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:58.812
- Hm, wouldn't you like to know?

258
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.314
Thank you.

259
00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:44.925
- Do I look okay?
- Breathe.

260
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.294
- Oh,
he shot me.

261
00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:50.831
- Big cough.
- I think we

262
00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:51.832
could work together here.

263
00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:53.334
Okay?

264
00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:55.469
You know, my enemy's the
enemy kinda thing, right?

265
00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:56.837
What do you say?

266
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.772
Am I the only one

267
00:13:57.806 --> 00:14:00.107
that stays in my freakin' lane?

268
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.309
- Yeah, see,
I know where they're goin'.

269
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.401
- Lady, I gotta go.

270
00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:28.402
- Mm, uh uh.

271
00:14:29.838 --> 00:14:31.271
No, I want you to stay.

272
00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:34.709
Come on, yeah.

273
00:14:34.743 --> 00:14:36.110
Come on, stay.

274
00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:38.011
Come back.

275
00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.080
Come back and then...

276
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:41.882
That's a good boy.

277
00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:44.184
You stay right there.

278
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.724
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

279
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:50.592
Don't move.

280
00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:55.062
I just want you to stay and
talk to me for a little, 'kay?

281
00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:03.170
I just need you to
talk to me until

282
00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.906
the sun comes up and then...

283
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.881
I need you to, I need
you to distract me, okay?

284
00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:14.948
I just, uh, can you just be

285
00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:17.084
a little bit louder
than they are?

286
00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:20.154
Can you help me, be
just, uh, louder?

287
00:15:57.926 --> 00:15:59.426
- I sent you to school, right?

288
00:16:00.862 --> 00:16:02.496
And when I sent you to school,

289
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.833
they taught you how
numbers work, I assume?

290
00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:05.900
- Oh, boy, here we go again.

291
00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:07.769
- So, what is higher?

292
00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:09.671
150, or 190?

293
00:16:09.704 --> 00:16:12.039
Because right now, I'm kinda
hazy on the whole thing

294
00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:14.374
because I thought
this was a shakedown.

295
00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:16.076
I thought we were gonna
work our way up slowly

296
00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:18.212
on the speed and I thought
we had an agreement

297
00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:20.815
to keep our sponsor who's
been very good to us,

298
00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:22.550
happy by not blowin' up the bike

299
00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:25.720
they pay us to build or turn
it into some shiny lawn dart

300
00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:27.321
out there in the desert.

301
00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:29.156
- In order for it to
be a proper shakedown,

302
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:31.693
you have to be willing
to shake things up.

303
00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:32.627
- She has a point.

304
00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:35.697
- Slow down, girl.

305
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.564
- Can't hear ya.

306
00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:37.932
- I said slow down.

307
00:16:37.966 --> 00:16:38.967
- I'm sorry, what?

308
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.668
Can't, can't hear you.

309
00:16:40.702 --> 00:16:41.703
- Slow down.

310
00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:53.080
That girl's got
the wind up her ass

311
00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:55.048
since the day she was born.

312
00:16:55.917 --> 00:16:57.150
- Yep.

313
00:16:58.385 --> 00:16:58.987
Yep.

314
00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:14.434
- Hello, Miss?

315
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.069
Hey, excuse me.

316
00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:18.372
Excuse me.

317
00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:19.707
Hello.

318
00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:21.108
Hey, excuse me.

319
00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:23.912
Excuse me.

320
00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:24.712
Ma'am?

321
00:17:24.746 --> 00:17:25.880
Hello?

322
00:17:25.914 --> 00:17:28.048
Hey, you just
can't walk in here.

323
00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:30.718
These planes are worth
billions of dollars.

324
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:33.788
- Right, I wouldn't wanna
ruin a billionaire's day,

325
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:35.957
especially the
local TV evangelist.

326
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.358
- Can we discuss
this in my office?

327
00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:42.997
- Well, as far as I'm
concerned, this is your office.

328
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:44.866
- Look, I don't know
who you think you are

329
00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:46.868
but you have no
jurisdiction in here.

330
00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:48.903
- Actually, I do.

331
00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:51.238
You see, you're regional.

332
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:55.242
That means TSA and CPP,
they can't get in the way.

333
00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:57.879
It's funny,
I actually competed

334
00:17:57.912 --> 00:17:59.881
in farmyard teenage
beauty pageants

335
00:17:59.914 --> 00:18:02.349
that had a tighter
managerial hierarchy

336
00:18:02.382 --> 00:18:05.152
than this glorified
desert lunchbox.

337
00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:05.954
- Screw you.

338
00:18:05.987 --> 00:18:07.254
I'm calling head office.

339
00:18:08.022 --> 00:18:09.323
- How 'bout this?

340
00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:11.793
I'm grounding everything
that's pointy,

341
00:18:11.826 --> 00:18:12.927
expensive and has two wings

342
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:15.329
until I inspect
it front to back.

343
00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:19.199
- You're just mean.

344
00:18:20.768 --> 00:18:23.270
- If I were you, I'd get lost.

345
00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:24.639
That is, of course,
unless you would like

346
00:18:24.672 --> 00:18:26.206
to make things personal.

347
00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:29.611
- Bitch.

348
00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:31.579
- Atta boy.

349
00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:44.726
- Shelby, we're ready for you.

350
00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:51.666
- Hey, Carol, how you doin'?

351
00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:53.233
- I'm good, thanks.

352
00:18:54.035 --> 00:18:55.036
Listen, we've got a-

353
00:18:55.069 --> 00:18:55.937
- I know.

354
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.538
I'm behind on bills.

355
00:18:57.572 --> 00:18:58.906
- Way behind.

356
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.976
Look, all you have to do is
pay something each month.

357
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.176
Any amount, all right?

358
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.079
Just to show us you're
making an effort.

359
00:19:05.113 --> 00:19:06.346
That's all.

360
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:08.683

390
00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:09.644
- It's that obvious?

391
00:20:10.878 --> 00:20:14.414
- Well, no gear and you look
like you've just seen a ghost.

392
00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:18.786
No, no, no, don't, don't
tell me there's no meds.

393
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.722
- I saved what I could for ya.

394
00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:22.957
I know it's not that
much, just take it.

395
00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:27.061
Keep the money, keep the money.

396
00:20:27.095 --> 00:20:28.295
Just take it.

397
00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:33.101
- You're gonna get a new
supply in, though, right?

398
00:20:33.134 --> 00:20:34.602
- I don't know.

399
00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:36.470
I don't know.

400
00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:38.271
All the local pilots are
freaking out right now.

401
00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.907
If I can't get
supplies to Vegas,

402
00:20:39.941 --> 00:20:43.276
I break this chain,
everything stops, all right?

403
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.312
I'm telling you now so
you can make other plans.

404
00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:47.715
- other plans.

405
00:20:47.749 --> 00:20:48.983
What other plans?

406
00:20:50.283 --> 00:20:52.086
I can't afford legal meds.

407
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.386
And you're my only hookup.

408
00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:58.593
- All right, just
give me one week.

409
00:20:58.626 --> 00:21:01.996
Stay in contact and I'll do my
best to figure something out.

410
00:21:05.767 --> 00:21:08.970
It's the timing that's
the problem here, okay?

411
00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:10.204
There is a three-hour window

412
00:21:10.238 --> 00:21:11.271
to move everything
and that's it.

413
00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:12.472
The deal implodes.

414
00:21:14.509 --> 00:21:17.477
Don't give up on me
just yet, all right?

415
00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:18.980
We'll figure it out.

416
00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:34.427
- That is a fuel pump rod
stuck in the block all right.

417
00:21:35.263 --> 00:21:37.265
All right, great.

418
00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:38.933
- Oh, it wouldn't be
a proper job, Tommy,

419
00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:41.669
unless a two-minute job
turned into a two-hour job.

420
00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.037
- Mm hm.

421
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.272
- You can work it out?

422
00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:45.540
- Let's see.

423
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:49.376
- At least we get to spend some
time together for once, huh?

424
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.546
Because Shelby's been spendin'

425
00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:53.681
a lotta time with
his grandma lately.

426
00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.617
- Yeah, I've been pullin'
a lot of overtime, Dad.

427
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:58.186
I have to get these hours in.

428
00:21:58.219 --> 00:21:59.020
- And you will.

429
00:22:00.254 --> 00:22:02.322
I'm gonna get you into
the union if it kills me.

430
00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:06.326
- Teamsters union has the
best medical packages.

431
00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.628
You got to compete, though.

432
00:22:07.662 --> 00:22:10.097
I mean, with the whole
gig economy and all that.

433
00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:11.799
- That's what
they're calling it.

434
00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:14.101
Well, as long as it's
all legit, right?

435
00:22:14.135 --> 00:22:15.102
Nothing illegal?

436
00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:18.306
Because I wouldn't want you
two out on the street racin'

437
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:20.875
for pinks or anything
stupid like that.

438
00:22:21.876 --> 00:22:26.379
- Yeah, um, because that
would be very stupid.

439
00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:28.216
- Super stupid.

440
00:22:28.249 --> 00:22:31.152
- But hey, you know, at
least we're not doing

441
00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:32.452
the old Silver
Trails 300 anymore

442
00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:34.555
'cause that was really sketchy.

443
00:22:36.324 --> 00:22:38.259
- What's the Silver Trails 300?

444
00:22:38.292 --> 00:22:39.560
- Don't ask, Dad.

445
00:22:43.197 --> 00:22:44.532
- Okay, then, I won't.

446
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.335
I think we can probably pry

447
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:48.836
this out with a
ring spanner, Tommy.

448
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.006
It's an old trick I used to
use in big-box Chevelle's.

449
00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:53.107
- All right.

450
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.308
- You know what a
ring spanner is?

451
00:22:54.342 --> 00:22:55.509
- Yeah, I know
what a ring spanner is.

452
00:22:55.543 --> 00:22:56.443
- You have a ring spanner Tommy?

453
00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:57.511
- Yes, I have a ring spanner.

454
00:22:57.545 --> 00:22:59.013
- Why don't ya go get it?

455
00:22:59.847 --> 00:23:00.681
Now.

456
00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:02.850
Thank you.

457
00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:10.825
Hey, are you okay?

458
00:23:10.858 --> 00:23:11.893
- I'm good.

459
00:23:11.926 --> 00:23:15.029
No, I just figured
out what we needed.

460
00:23:15.062 --> 00:23:15.863
- What?

461
00:23:15.897 --> 00:23:16.697
- More beer.

462
00:23:18.332 --> 00:23:19.634
- Now you're cookin'.

463
00:23:21.035 --> 00:23:22.069
- Pop.

464
00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:23.938
- That is why she's the
brains of the operation

465
00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:26.274
and you and I are not.

466
00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:36.416
- Go for Jackson.

467
00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:37.718
- Jackson, Connolly.

468
00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:39.921
Listen, I was just
calling to tell you,

469
00:23:39.954 --> 00:23:42.356
you're doing a great
job with the planes.

470
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.658
Surveillance says
that the runners

471
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:45.626
are refusing to move product.

472
00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:48.262
I'm impressed.

473
00:23:48.296 --> 00:23:49.730
- Listen, the smugglers
will be back up

474
00:23:49.764 --> 00:23:52.366
and running before you
know so don't you worry.

475
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.368
- Yeah, about that, I just
got a call from up top

476
00:23:54.402 --> 00:23:57.939
and apparently we're being
a little too effective.

477
00:23:57.972 --> 00:24:01.275
We're interfering with our
friends' other operations.

478
00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:02.777
I'm gonna need you to slow down.

479
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.912
- Listen, I haven't even
gathered any evidence yet

480
00:24:04.946 --> 00:24:06.647
so I'll slow down once I
know this thing is shut down.

481
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:09.317
- You'll slow down right
now like I just told you to.

482
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.353
That is in order.

483
00:24:12.386 --> 00:24:14.255
What the hell was that?

484
00:24:14.288 --> 00:24:15.089
- A box.

485
00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:17.058
Um, a box just fell.

486
00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:19.794
Okay.

487
00:24:19.827 --> 00:24:22.163
I'll get the paperwork
gathered up for you then.

488
00:24:22.196 --> 00:24:23.030
- Good.

489
00:24:24.332 --> 00:24:25.733
You do good work.

490
00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:27.702
You're an asset.

491
00:24:49.489 --> 00:24:50.725
- Jeez, Renzo.

492
00:24:50.758 --> 00:24:52.026
You scared the hell out of me.

493
00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:54.261
- You're the one
showin' up unannounced.

494
00:24:56.163 --> 00:24:57.431
- Got any bourbon in there?

495
00:24:57.465 --> 00:24:59.633
After that I could
use a stiff drink.

496
00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:02.636
- You should probably
call before you visit.

497
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:07.074
- Well, I'm sorry to intrude
but I have a proposal for you.

498
00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:12.446
About a year ago, we
were working on this set

499
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.915
with some really shady
investors from Vegas.

500
00:25:14.949 --> 00:25:16.384
They would have us run
things back and forth

501
00:25:16.417 --> 00:25:17.918
from there overnight.

502
00:25:17.952 --> 00:25:19.720
People, packages.

503
00:25:19.754 --> 00:25:21.555
We never knew who or
what we were moving.

504
00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:23.391
We just knew not
to ask questions

505
00:25:23.424 --> 00:25:25.359
and not to get
stopped by the cops.

506
00:25:25.393 --> 00:25:26.627
We had this system going.

507
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.729
It was called the
Silver Trails 300.

508
00:25:29.697 --> 00:25:31.432
You have Route 62,

509
00:25:31.465 --> 00:25:34.301
we head east, swing up, 95,

510
00:25:35.436 --> 00:25:36.737
all the way to Vegas.

511
00:25:37.571 --> 00:25:38.406
300 miles.

512
00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:39.840
- Okay.

513
00:25:39.874 --> 00:25:41.510
Five hour drive, give or take.

514
00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:43.512
- If you're playing
by the rules,

515
00:25:43.544 --> 00:25:45.546
yeah, it's about five hours.

516
00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:47.448
But what most people don't
know is there's a gap

517
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:49.950
in the state police shift
change at the border.

518
00:25:49.984 --> 00:25:52.553
You time it right, run it like
you mean it the whole way,

519
00:25:52.586 --> 00:25:54.855
average three
digits, no pit stops,

520
00:25:54.889 --> 00:25:56.090
you can make it in three hours

521
00:25:56.123 --> 00:25:58.125
and the cops'll never
know you were there.

522
00:26:00.194 --> 00:26:04.165
- You're suggesting you run
my contraband up the highway?

523
00:26:04.198 --> 00:26:05.399
- If it frees up this chain

524
00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:06.867
and keep things
moving, then yes.

525
00:26:07.701 --> 00:26:09.303
Unless you have a better idea?

526
00:26:09.336 --> 00:26:12.306
Because right now, it's my
little boy's life on the line.

527
00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:13.574
- I respect that, okay?

528
00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:16.243
But there is a massive
flaw in your plan.

529
00:26:16.277 --> 00:26:19.480
You wanna move a package,
a person in a sports car,

530
00:26:19.514 --> 00:26:20.915
that's easy, okay?

531
00:26:20.948 --> 00:26:23.217
But we're talking about a
weighty amount of product here.

532
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.185
- Hm.

533
00:26:24.218 --> 00:26:25.352
Let me give you a tour.

534
00:26:29.657 --> 00:26:31.859
650 horsepower to the wheels.

535
00:26:31.892 --> 00:26:33.794
Over 1,000 foot
pounds of torque.

536
00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:38.766
Fuel tanks take the
best of 50 gallons easy.

537
00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:41.769
She'll run low elevens all day
long even in the midday heat.

538
00:26:41.802 --> 00:26:43.070
Oh, check this out.

539
00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:47.241
Load her up with five tons,

540
00:26:47.274 --> 00:26:50.177
she'll just lay back,
cackle and pull even harder.

541
00:26:52.514 --> 00:26:54.782
- Well, she's anything
but inconspicuous.

542
00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:56.884
- Oh, I'm not done yet.

543
00:26:59.653 --> 00:27:02.056
I don't like getting any
attention I don't want.

544
00:27:03.224 --> 00:27:05.759
On the streets, they
call her the Night Train.

545
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.630
Personally, I like to
call her Black Bess.

546
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:11.432
- Dick Turpin's horse?

547
00:27:11.465 --> 00:27:13.568
- What can I say?

548
00:27:13.602 --> 00:27:14.702
I like my highwaymen.

549
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.306
Look, I want my fuel covered

550
00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.842
and I want the meds I
normally receive for free.

551
00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:23.310
I'll get your
medication to Vegas

552
00:27:23.344 --> 00:27:25.746
and I will make planes
look slow in the process.

553
00:27:26.947 --> 00:27:29.250
- You're making it
really hard to say no.

554
00:27:29.283 --> 00:27:30.417
- Then give me a yes.

555
00:27:36.757 --> 00:27:40.127
- Meet me on the access
road by the wind farm.

556
00:27:41.262 --> 00:27:43.598
Keeps the sky clear
of any helicopters.

557
00:27:43.632 --> 00:27:44.533
Speak to no one.

558
00:27:44.566 --> 00:27:46.535
My men'll know the drill.

559
00:27:46.568 --> 00:27:47.801
- Will they be armed?

560
00:27:47.835 --> 00:27:49.571
- Assume
everyone you meet over

561
00:27:49.604 --> 00:27:51.372
the next 24 hours is armed.

562
00:27:52.574 --> 00:27:53.741
I wish I could go with you

563
00:27:53.774 --> 00:27:57.044
but Vegas has far
too many cameras.

564
00:27:57.077 --> 00:27:58.547
- I think I'll be okay.

565
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.649
I've done this a million times.

566
00:28:00.681 --> 00:28:02.816
- Not for
people like this.

567
00:28:03.618 --> 00:28:04.852
When you get to Vegas,

568
00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:07.955
you head to the loading
dock at the Westgate Hotel.

569
00:28:07.988 --> 00:28:10.157
Our contact loves to
live the high life.

570
00:28:11.258 --> 00:28:13.093
Again, talk to nobody.

571
00:28:13.127 --> 00:28:14.596
You'll be given
the money in a bag,

572
00:28:14.629 --> 00:28:16.631
you take it and you
head straight home.

573
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.501
Be careful.

574
00:29:37.044 --> 00:29:37.646
- Whoa!

575
00:29:55.764 --> 00:29:57.898
- Mr. Maxwell wants
to speak to you.

576
00:29:57.931 --> 00:29:59.033
- I have to get
back on the road.

577
00:29:59.066 --> 00:30:01.802
- It's nonnegotiable, honey.

578
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:29.664
- Yes!

579
00:30:29.698 --> 00:30:31.800
- Somebody wanted to see me?

580
00:30:51.852 --> 00:30:54.121
- I'm not a man who
likes to mince words.

581
00:30:55.122 --> 00:30:56.924
I like to tell it like it is.

582
00:30:58.058 --> 00:31:02.229
I like country girls.

583
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:05.933
Y'all are a different breed.

584
00:31:07.201 --> 00:31:10.371
Women here, they're like
blowup dolls with a pulse.

585
00:31:11.872 --> 00:31:17.044
So, I was wondering if
you might wanna hang out,

586
00:31:18.245 --> 00:31:21.048
make a little extra,
have some fun?

587
00:31:21.081 --> 00:31:22.116
Hm?

588
00:31:23.852 --> 00:31:26.987
- I'm
just here to drive.

589
00:31:28.922 --> 00:31:31.492
And I have a really long
night ahead of me, so I...

590
00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:34.294
- Can't blame a man
for asking, right?

591
00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:43.003
By the way, I wanted to
give you this, a bonus.

592
00:31:44.371 --> 00:31:46.741
We were in a tight
spot and I understand

593
00:31:46.775 --> 00:31:48.142
that you did the impossible.

594
00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:51.311
Consider it a personal
thank you from me.

595
00:31:55.349 --> 00:31:57.351
I also wanna give
you my cell number

596
00:31:58.318 --> 00:32:00.087
in case you run
into any trouble,

597
00:32:01.922 --> 00:32:03.424
or if you change your mind.

598
00:32:08.962 --> 00:32:09.764
- Thank you.

599
00:32:09.798 --> 00:32:10.931
- Hm.

600
00:32:12.032 --> 00:32:15.135
- Wait, I'm sorry, I'm gonna
need you to repeat that.

601
00:32:15.169 --> 00:32:16.403
- I said we just received word,

602
00:32:16.437 --> 00:32:18.105
another shipment
has reached Vegas.

603
00:32:18.138 --> 00:32:20.340
- Well, I hate to
say I told you so.

604
00:32:20.374 --> 00:32:22.677
- Not as much as I hate
to hear you say it.

605
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.478
You're back on, Jackson.

606
00:32:24.512 --> 00:32:26.180
- Yeesh, I'm pullin' on
so many U-turns here,

607
00:32:26.213 --> 00:32:28.783
I'm beginning to think that
I'm competing in NASCAR.

608
00:32:28.817 --> 00:32:30.518
- We got a leak on
the receiving side.

609
00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:33.922
Apparently, the shipment
came in at night via train.

610
00:32:33.987 --> 00:32:35.557
- Via train?

611
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.658
I'm not sure that adds up.

612
00:32:36.691 --> 00:32:40.027
Well, looks like I'm goin'
on another wild goose chase.

613
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.228
- Okay, then, you do that,

614
00:32:41.261 --> 00:32:42.797
and Jackson, lose the attitude.

615
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:44.599
Things change when
the information does.

616
00:32:44.632 --> 00:32:45.867
You should know that by now.

617
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.167
- And you should try
to find someone else

618
00:32:47.201 --> 00:32:48.536
who's willing to run
around the desert

619
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.771
doing your dirty work.

620
00:32:49.804 --> 00:32:50.872
Better yet, maybe
you should go after

621
00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:52.239
a big dog on your own turf

622
00:32:52.272 --> 00:32:54.408
rather than barking
at little ole me.

623
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:55.409
- Just get it done.

624
00:33:29.109 --> 00:33:31.078
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

625
00:33:31.111 --> 00:33:32.914
I bet with the beast like
that no one ever gives

626
00:33:32.947 --> 00:33:34.248
you crap on the road, huh?

627
00:33:35.349 --> 00:33:37.986
- Yeah, they do tend
to see me coming.

628
00:33:38.018 --> 00:33:39.687
- Hm, I should upgrade.

629
00:33:40.889 --> 00:33:43.156
Must be a real bitch
on gas though, huh?

630
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.225
- Well, she drinks
diesel but yeah,

631
00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:46.661
she gets pretty thirsty.

632
00:33:48.897 --> 00:33:51.265
Long night?

633
00:33:52.366 --> 00:33:55.703
- Long night, long
day, long week.

634
00:33:55.737 --> 00:33:57.906
- Yeah, tell me about it.

635
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.751
- Good morning.

636
00:34:43.785 --> 00:34:44.686
- It's afternoon.

637
00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.554
Why are you just getting up?

638
00:34:46.588 --> 00:34:50.157
- Because Mommy's life is an
unmitigated disaster, okay?

639
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.793
- Okay.

640
00:34:51.826 --> 00:34:53.193
- You like your doll then?

641
00:34:53.226 --> 00:34:54.896
- Yeah, it's cool.

642
00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.263
- Grandma still alive?

643
00:34:56.296 --> 00:34:58.032
- Then we're doin' okay.

644
00:34:58.066 --> 00:34:59.067
I love you.

645
00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:00.133
- I love you, too.

646
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.182
- Hey, got any extra
rifles layin' around?

647
00:35:15.215 --> 00:35:16.784
'Cause I kind of feel
like Tony Montana.

648
00:35:16.818 --> 00:35:18.019
- Yeah?

649
00:35:18.052 --> 00:35:19.020
Well, don't get too excited.

650
00:35:19.053 --> 00:35:20.855
This is only
temporary, remember?

651
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.658
- Wow, way to be a buzz kill.

652
00:35:25.059 --> 00:35:26.928
You saying I can't handle
it because I'm a girl?

653
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:28.395
- If anything, you're a natural.

654
00:35:28.428 --> 00:35:31.398
I just don't wanna see you
become a fully-fledged criminal.

655
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:33.500
- Well, you're not wrong there.

656
00:35:33.534 --> 00:35:36.971
Turns out I am so good, Mr.
Maxwell gave me a bonus.

657
00:35:37.005 --> 00:35:38.438
Handed it to me himself.

658
00:35:40.008 --> 00:35:41.709
- You took money
from Mr. Maxwell?

659
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:43.811
- Yeah.

660
00:35:45.046 --> 00:35:46.714
Why are you looking
at me like that?

661
00:35:46.748 --> 00:35:48.181
Did I do something wrong?

662
00:35:49.784 --> 00:35:50.752
- Come here.

663
00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.161
What he's done is
he's bought you.

664
00:36:01.194 --> 00:36:03.296
He's gonna expect
something in return.

665
00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:06.299
Nothing in life comes for free.

666
00:36:07.267 --> 00:36:09.336
Every favor comes with a debt.

667
00:36:09.369 --> 00:36:12.573
Every criminal act,
subject to karma.

668
00:36:13.875 --> 00:36:14.709
Just how it is.

669
00:36:15.677 --> 00:36:16.944
- Hm.

670
00:36:16.978 --> 00:36:18.178
Shelby came for free.

671
00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:21.949
- Your boy?
- Mm hm.

672
00:36:21.983 --> 00:36:22.884
Yeah.

673
00:36:22.917 --> 00:36:23.785
He's my little miracle baby.

674
00:36:25.086 --> 00:36:27.722
I was told I was never gonna
be able to get pregnant,

675
00:36:27.755 --> 00:36:28.823
and it broke my heart.

676
00:36:29.824 --> 00:36:32.292
It was the last thing
in the world I expected.

677
00:36:33.094 --> 00:36:35.129
Shelby's dad didn't
want me to keep him.

678
00:36:35.163 --> 00:36:38.331
But I mean, how do you
turn down a gift like that?

679
00:36:42.202 --> 00:36:43.303
- Maybe I'm wrong.

680
00:36:44.072 --> 00:36:45.405
I mean, he's proof.

681
00:36:47.274 --> 00:36:48.308
I hope he is.

682
00:36:50.277 --> 00:36:51.913
Seems to me that's
all the more reason

683
00:36:51.946 --> 00:36:53.280
you both need to be kept safe.

684
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.044

California anymore

698

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.006
- Well, I was just
telling my friend here

712
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.641
how I modified my rig,
- Mm.

713
00:39:00.675 --> 00:39:03.144
- for more power and economy.

714
00:39:03.177 --> 00:39:04.411
Goin' faster for cheaper.

715
00:39:05.478 --> 00:39:07.315
- Cheers to you.

716
00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:08.316
- Cheers to me.

717
00:39:08.348 --> 00:39:09.584
- Mm.

718
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.586
Wait a minute.

719
00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:13.287
You know, I know the first
law of thermodynamics

720
00:39:13.321 --> 00:39:15.388
and you can't get more
power using less energy.

721
00:39:15.422 --> 00:39:16.290
That's basic physics.

722
00:39:16.324 --> 00:39:18.559
So, uh, you're full of crap.

723
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.761
- Are you sure you're
looking for conversation

724
00:39:20.795 --> 00:39:22.897
or are you looking
for an argument?

725
00:39:23.898 --> 00:39:27.535
- Honestly, I'd be
happy with either.

726
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.304
- Okay.

727
00:39:30.338 --> 00:39:33.674
Well, power is a
factor of efficiency.

728
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:35.142
The trade-off
you're talking about

729
00:39:35.176 --> 00:39:39.146
is in other areas
like durability,
power band, emissions.

730
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.681
If you take one of
these big diesels,

731
00:39:40.715 --> 00:39:42.350
but you turn up
the pressure, man,

732
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:44.952
they'll pull harder
and roll longer.

733
00:39:44.986 --> 00:39:47.588
And that, that's a fact.

734
00:39:47.622 --> 00:39:51.692
And no offense, but, uh, you
need to stay in your lane.

735
00:39:53.327 --> 00:39:57.231
- Feisty one, huh?

736
00:39:57.265 --> 00:39:58.165
- Yeah.

737
00:39:58.199 --> 00:40:00.268
- Now were talkin'.

738
00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:01.135
- Hm.

739
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.938
- I need to stay off
the tracks, I know that.

740
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:06.140
That turned out to
be another dead end.

741
00:40:07.308 --> 00:40:08.542
- What?

742
00:40:10.443 --> 00:40:13.381
- I'm trying to work out
how someone gets a load

743
00:40:13.413 --> 00:40:14.916
of contraband to Vegas at speed

744
00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:17.251
and under law enforcement's
nose and it ain't via trains,

745
00:40:17.285 --> 00:40:18.252
that's for sure.

746
00:40:18.286 --> 00:40:20.453
There's way, way
too many checks.

747
00:40:21.522 --> 00:40:26.527
So, I'm back to randomly
inspecting rigs like yours

748
00:40:27.328 --> 00:40:29.263
until I can come up
with a better idea.

749
00:40:29.297 --> 00:40:30.430

way more than you ever could.

- A few tons at a
time, maybe five.

761
00:41:02.163 --> 00:41:03.496
- I'll tell you what,

762

you're about to hate me a
lot more than I hate you.

763

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.331

- This one's gonna kill.

782
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.736
- Okay.

783
00:41:41.769 --> 00:41:43.437
- Uh , what
do you call a soldier

784
00:41:43.471 --> 00:41:45.573
who's been sprayed
by both mustard gas-

785
00:41:45.606 --> 00:41:47.208
- Wait.
- And pepper spray?

786
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:48.509
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, I'm-

787
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:50.478
- No, it's fine.
- No, I'm, I'm, I'm military.

788
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:53.280
I'm, I'm ex-military.

789
00:41:54.482 --> 00:41:55.716
- You're a vet?

790
00:41:57.451 --> 00:41:59.220
- Sergeant First Class.

791
00:41:59.253 --> 00:42:00.321
- Oh.

792
00:42:01.555 --> 00:42:03.858
Did, uh, did you see combat?

793
00:42:08.195 --> 00:42:10.097
- Did I see combat?

794
00:42:14.502 --> 00:42:18.706
About 15 miles
outside of Baghdad,

795
00:42:20.174 --> 00:42:23.512
RPG flipped a Humvee in
front of us like a tin can,

796
00:42:23.544 --> 00:42:27.081
and then we lost half our squad.

797
00:42:27.114 --> 00:42:28.382
- Whew.

798
00:42:28.416 --> 00:42:29.683
- Just like that.

799
00:42:31.752 --> 00:42:34.188
And we went toe to
toe with insurgents

800
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:39.627
for an hour as we watched
our friends die in the dirt.

801
00:42:47.802 --> 00:42:50.171
That was a real bloodbath.

802
00:42:50.204 --> 00:42:53.542
You know?

803
00:42:53.574 --> 00:42:58.779
Like, the kind, um, people
win medals for surviving.

804
00:43:01.949 --> 00:43:07.154
But we didn't do any, we
didn't want any metals.

805
00:43:07.855 --> 00:43:10.825
We just wanted revenge.

806
00:43:14.328 --> 00:43:15.129
- Did you get it?

807
00:43:20.634 --> 00:43:22.036
- I like your beard.

808
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:24.772
I really wanna touch your beard.

809
00:43:24.805 --> 00:43:28.142
- Here touch.
- I wanna touch your beard.

810
00:43:30.845 --> 00:43:33.380
Oh, God, that feels so good.

811
00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.262
- Why you in the shop truck?

812
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.534
- Oh, I needed something
my mom could climb into.

813
00:43:52.567 --> 00:43:53.400
- Oh, wow.

814
00:43:54.368 --> 00:43:55.336
You look like hell.

815
00:43:56.637 --> 00:43:57.572
- Thanks, Tommy.

816
00:43:58.939 --> 00:44:01.408
I had like three energy drinks
and nothing's kickin' in.

817
00:44:01.442 --> 00:44:02.243
Is the coffee ready?

818
00:44:02.276 --> 00:44:03.144
- No, no.

819
00:44:04.745 --> 00:44:07.381
What you need is
some rest, though.

820
00:44:07.414 --> 00:44:08.617
- I'll be okay.

821
00:44:08.649 --> 00:44:09.683
- Uh huh.

822
00:45:12.581 --> 00:45:13.814
- Sorry.

823
00:45:18.485 --> 00:45:19.654
- Hey, hey!

824
00:45:19.688 --> 00:45:21.155
Hey, you were just
in my trailer.

825
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:24.458
Wait a minute, I remember
why I saw you before.

826
00:45:24.491 --> 00:45:26.961
You're that redneck who was
driving that stupid truck.

827
00:45:26.994 --> 00:45:28.663
Hey, can somebody tell me

828
00:45:28.697 --> 00:45:30.798
why it is we have a
thief and a cheat on set?

829
00:45:30.831 --> 00:45:32.233
- Okay, your plastic surgeon
better be on speed dial

830
00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:33.668
because you don't get to
talk to my friends like that.

831
00:45:33.702 --> 00:45:35.502
- Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, calm down.

832
00:45:35.537 --> 00:45:36.638
What the hell's going on?

833
00:45:36.671 --> 00:45:38.739
- Your girl over here
took over a grand

834
00:45:38.772 --> 00:45:41.008
from my trailer plus some
of my personal stuff,

835
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:43.744
and this jackass was
just about to assault me.

836
00:45:44.646 --> 00:45:46.180
- Did you take anything of his?

837
00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:49.517
Wait here.

838
00:46:07.669 --> 00:46:10.538
Your stuff wasn't
stolen, doofus.

839
00:46:10.572 --> 00:46:11.405
It was hidden.

840
00:46:12.973 --> 00:46:14.008
She was trying to protect you.

841
00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:18.145
- My personal items?

842
00:46:19.813 --> 00:46:21.616
- I don't know
anything about that.

843
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:22.717
You know what?

844
00:46:22.751 --> 00:46:23.851
We're done here.

845
00:46:23.884 --> 00:46:25.319
We're finishing this
commercial without you.

846
00:46:26.387 --> 00:46:27.187
- You can't do that.

847
00:46:27.221 --> 00:46:28.422
- Watch me.

848
00:46:28.455 --> 00:46:29.356
I've been waiting for an excuse

849
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.158
to fire your ass from day one.

850
00:46:32.126 --> 00:46:34.828
And hey, I bought
that jacket myself.

851
00:46:34.862 --> 00:46:36.130
- That's mine.

852
00:46:37.632 --> 00:46:38.633
- Escort this jackass

853
00:46:38.667 --> 00:46:39.900
and get him off the set please.

854
00:46:39.933 --> 00:46:42.303
- Hey, congrats on your
Pinto commercial, Spielberg.

855
00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:44.438
I hope it's a hit.

856
00:47:47.167 --> 00:47:48.603
Try to sneak one more

857
00:47:48.636 --> 00:47:51.271
and then let's see a little
more.

858
00:49:28.268 --> 00:49:29.871
- Boss wants to see you.

859
00:49:57.164 --> 00:49:57.966
- Mom?

860
00:49:57.998 --> 00:49:59.333
- Hey.

861
00:49:59.366 --> 00:50:00.668
How you doin'?

862
00:50:00.702 --> 00:50:02.202
- I was sleeping.

863
00:50:03.036 --> 00:50:07.140
- I know, I just needed
to hear your voice.

864
00:50:08.242 --> 00:50:09.878
- Where are you?

865
00:50:09.911 --> 00:50:11.345
- I'll be home soon, bud.

866
00:50:13.013 --> 00:50:14.381
I'll be home soon.

867
00:50:36.004 --> 00:50:37.739
- It's you.

868
00:50:37.772 --> 00:50:38.573
- Thanks, buddy.

869
00:50:38.606 --> 00:50:39.439
I owe you one.

870
00:50:45.112 --> 00:50:46.213
You on a stakeout?

871
00:50:47.916 --> 00:50:48.750
You undercover?

872
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.119
Under the influence.

873
00:50:52.921 --> 00:50:57.859
- You know, you're a
real piece of work.

874
00:50:57.892 --> 00:50:59.259
Yeah.

875
00:50:59.293 --> 00:51:04.431
You see, you got one person
working alone with no resources,

876
00:51:05.332 --> 00:51:06.834
no leads that
actually go anywhere.

877
00:51:06.868 --> 00:51:11.706
And now I have to
search every pickup truck.

878
00:51:15.043 --> 00:51:18.145
And boy, do we
love our pickup trucks.

879
00:51:19.146 --> 00:51:24.351
You are asking
me to do the impossible.

880
00:51:25.352 --> 00:51:27.055
And to top it off ,

881
00:51:27.087 --> 00:51:30.024
you can't even decide
what that impossible

882
00:51:30.058 --> 00:51:31.491
thing is that you want.

883
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:37.331
- Well, that's a sob story.

884
00:51:38.933 --> 00:51:44.137
- I just work and work and work.

885
00:51:47.008 --> 00:51:49.077
I just can't lay down roots.

886
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:51.779
I can't make friends,
and for what?

887
00:51:51.813 --> 00:51:54.348
To help people?

888
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:58.118
The people that I want
to help can't be helped.

889
00:51:58.151 --> 00:52:01.022
They're just a lost cause,

890
00:52:01.055 --> 00:52:03.858
chronically
self-destructive.

891
00:52:05.125 --> 00:52:07.260
- Hey, there's somethin'
you know about.

892
00:52:09.129 --> 00:52:11.131
Self-destructive behavior.

893
00:52:11.164 --> 00:52:13.133
I mean, look, I'm not
makin' fun of PTSD.

894
00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:15.135
That's something serious.

895
00:52:15.168 --> 00:52:18.072
Yeah, I know about
your little incident.

896
00:52:18.106 --> 00:52:19.874
I read it in your
psych evaluation.

897
00:52:21.075 --> 00:52:21.909
Ooph.

898
00:52:22.944 --> 00:52:25.412
- You don't know what went down.

899
00:52:26.346 --> 00:52:29.050
We knew
that the insurgents

900
00:52:29.083 --> 00:52:32.053
liked to pose as
civilians, okay?

901
00:52:32.086 --> 00:52:33.286
We knew that.

902
00:52:34.088 --> 00:52:35.355
You know?

903
00:52:35.389 --> 00:52:39.292
We thought we
had good intelligence.

904
00:52:39.326 --> 00:52:43.230
They told us not to
leave any witnesses.

905
00:52:43.263 --> 00:52:45.533
They said, they said
that was an order.

906
00:52:46.199 --> 00:52:47.367
- That's right.

907
00:52:47.401 --> 00:52:49.971
It was in order, and
you follow your orders.

908
00:52:50.004 --> 00:52:51.171
That's what you do.

909
00:52:57.111 --> 00:52:59.047
You think you're the
only one who's figured

910
00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.214
out their working
for the machine.

911
00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:05.953
Yeah, I sleep fine at night.

912
00:53:10.223 --> 00:53:11.224
- You don't have to look them

913
00:53:11.258 --> 00:53:13.226
in the eyes every
night like I do.

914
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.295
- Yeah, there it is.

915
00:53:16.263 --> 00:53:17.497
That's my girl.

916
00:53:18.766 --> 00:53:19.667
What is that, huh?

917
00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:24.038
Hm?

918
00:53:24.072 --> 00:53:24.906
Guilt?

919
00:53:26.874 --> 00:53:28.408
I don't see it that way.

920
00:53:29.443 --> 00:53:31.478
I think you love it,
I think you need it.

921
00:53:31.512 --> 00:53:33.147
I think you want
it because that's

922
00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:35.783
the only feeling that you
even can feel anymore.

923
00:53:37.985 --> 00:53:39.787
Dead inside.

924
00:53:39.821 --> 00:53:41.321
Oh, I can trust the guilt.

925
00:53:44.158 --> 00:53:45.793
That's why you work for me.

926
00:53:47.195 --> 00:53:48.930
And it ain't the paycheck.

927
00:53:55.502 --> 00:53:57.370
Or are you just scared?

928
00:53:58.472 --> 00:54:01.441
'Cause I mean, who's gonna
want a washed up old vet?

929
00:54:04.212 --> 00:54:05.713
I do.

930
00:54:05.747 --> 00:54:06.581
I do.

931
00:54:12.954 --> 00:54:17.625
We're gonna have a nice long
relationship, me and you.

932
00:54:24.799 --> 00:54:28.002
You know, town's,
uh, it's that way.

933
00:55:03.303 --> 00:55:05.338
- Look, I got your
letters, okay?

934
00:55:05.372 --> 00:55:06.507
I'm working on it.

935
00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:08.375
I will get you the
money as soon as I can.

936
00:55:09.342 --> 00:55:10.711
I have to get back to work.

937
00:55:19.486 --> 00:55:21.354
You'll get your money, okay?

938
00:55:22.256 --> 00:55:25.425
- Oh, I
don't want your money.

939
00:55:26.294 --> 00:55:28.963
You know what I want from you.

940
00:55:29.997 --> 00:55:32.567
So, when are you gonna
pay me another visit?

941
00:55:33.267 --> 00:55:35.036
- How did you get my number?

942
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:38.739
- Oh, I have my fingers and
a lot of pies, Miss McCord.

943
00:55:38.773 --> 00:55:41.809
I hope I see you
again in Vegas soon.

944
00:55:41.843 --> 00:55:45.513
I do so miss the
smell of the country.

945
00:56:13.341 --> 00:56:14.374
- Mom?

946
00:56:17.278 --> 00:56:18.546
Shelby?

947
00:56:18.579 --> 00:56:20.314
- Taking care
of that nasty bear.

948
00:56:20.348 --> 00:56:21.616
- Yeah, you nasty bear.

949
00:56:21.649 --> 00:56:24.318
- Wait, no,
he's not quite dead yet.

950
00:56:24.352 --> 00:56:25.553
- Okay.

951
00:56:25.586 --> 00:56:28.923
- Shelby, go check
on grandma, please.

952
00:56:36.297 --> 00:56:37.999
- Hey.

953
00:56:38.032 --> 00:56:39.533
- What are you doing here?

954
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:41.769
- I did the math and you're due

955
00:56:41.802 --> 00:56:43.304
to run out of
antibiotics today so-

956
00:56:43.337 --> 00:56:45.339
- So, call.

957
00:56:45.373 --> 00:56:46.540
- Come on.

958
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.910
I called.

959
00:56:48.943 --> 00:56:50.077
You weren't picking up.

960
00:56:50.978 --> 00:56:53.648
Look, he needs his medication.

961
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:54.649
So-

962
00:56:54.682 --> 00:56:55.917
- So you just come
into my house?

963
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.450
- What do ya want me
to do, wait outside?

964
00:56:58.185 --> 00:56:59.419
I'm a wanted man.

965
00:56:59.452 --> 00:57:00.487
You know that.

966
00:57:01.454 --> 00:57:02.790
- How did you even
know where I lived?

967
00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:06.661
Oh, you had your boys
follow me home, didn't you?

968
00:57:06.694 --> 00:57:09.563
- Have you taken any more
money from our mutual friend?

969
00:57:09.597 --> 00:57:11.464
- Okay, listen, I
appreciate you stopping by

970
00:57:11.498 --> 00:57:14.835
and playing happy little
family with my son.

971
00:57:14.869 --> 00:57:16.837
I've hitched my wagon
to wild horses before

972
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:19.740
and I've learned that
they always break free.

973
00:57:20.942 --> 00:57:22.076
Please leave.

974
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:25.079
When there's business to
be done, I'll contact you.

975
00:57:28.015 --> 00:57:29.417
- You know what?

976
00:57:29.449 --> 00:57:31.786
Bad debts never take
care of good debts.

977
00:57:33.955 --> 00:57:37.591
Maybe it's you who's
the wild horse.

978
00:57:52.406 --> 00:57:53.674
- There we go.

979
00:57:54.742 --> 00:57:55.576
Ow. God!

980
00:57:56.711 --> 00:57:57.545
Ah!

981
00:57:58.546 --> 00:57:59.580
- Tough day?

982
00:58:01.649 --> 00:58:03.017
- Is there any other kind?

983
00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:03.884
- Hm.

984
00:58:04.652 --> 00:58:06.754
- What can I help you with?

985
00:58:06.787 --> 00:58:10.324
- You guys tune
diesel engines here, right?

986
00:58:10.358 --> 00:58:11.592
- That we do.

987
00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.130
We tune pretty much everything
except for pianos here.

988
00:58:16.163 --> 00:58:17.398
- Word on the street is you're

989
00:58:17.431 --> 00:58:19.367
the hottest tuning
shop in the state.

990
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.203
- I don't know about
that but, yeah, we try.

991
00:58:22.236 --> 00:58:23.070
- Huh.

992
00:58:24.271 --> 00:58:25.740
Let me ask you a hypothetical.

993
00:58:26.674 --> 00:58:29.343
Could you take a
truck that can carry,

994
00:58:29.377 --> 00:58:31.412
say, four, maybe
five tons and soup

995
00:58:31.445 --> 00:58:33.781
that thing up so it
goes a 100 miles an hour

996
00:58:33.814 --> 00:58:36.417
for three hours
without stopping?

997
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:37.752
Not even to refuel?

998
00:58:38.786 --> 00:58:42.523
- That is a very
specific request.

999
00:58:42.556 --> 00:58:47.762
Uh, but, yeah,
anything's possible.

1000
00:58:48.529 --> 00:58:50.698
Can I ask why?

1001
00:58:51.932 --> 00:58:57.138
- Well, I'm just
asking questions.

1002
00:59:00.107 --> 00:59:01.375
Theorizing.

1003
00:59:01.409 --> 00:59:02.476
- Theorizing.

1004
00:59:02.511 --> 00:59:03.677
- Postulating.

1005
00:59:05.012 --> 00:59:06.714
You know how it is.

1006
00:59:08.883 --> 00:59:10.317
- Yeah.

1007
00:59:10.351 --> 00:59:11.952
I know exactly how it is.

1008
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:18.759
Anyway, uh,
you are on private property.

1009
00:59:19.827 --> 00:59:24.065
Unless you want to arrest
me, you gonna arrest me?

1010
00:59:25.966 --> 00:59:27.001
No?

1011
00:59:27.034 --> 00:59:28.436
Okay, then I guess I
don't have to answer

1012
00:59:28.469 --> 00:59:30.604
anymore of your
dumb ass questions.

1013
00:59:31.572 --> 00:59:34.575
So, why don't you get
lost and come back

1014
00:59:34.608 --> 00:59:36.511
when you have some sort
of warrant or somethin'?

1015
00:59:41.949 --> 00:59:43.584
- I'll
see myself out then.

1016
00:59:50.525 --> 00:59:53.461
- Look at my castle, Princess.

1017
00:59:53.494 --> 00:59:54.428
Case closed.

1018
00:59:57.765 --> 00:59:59.366
- Now remember what I said,

1019
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.637
we're gonna start
off at 150, 1-5-0.

1020
01:00:03.671 --> 01:00:05.272
And we're gonna
bring the speed up

1021
01:00:05.306 --> 01:00:08.209
from there provided
she's steering on
your fingertips, okay?

1022
01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:09.310
Understand?

1023
01:00:09.343 --> 01:00:11.145
You can give me the stink
eye all you want, girl.

1024
01:00:11.178 --> 01:00:12.514
You know I'm right.

1025
01:00:12.547 --> 01:00:13.848
We start out slowly.

1026
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:16.383
We're going to finish
up much faster.

1027
01:00:17.318 --> 01:00:18.752
Well, look who showed up.

1028
01:00:20.354 --> 01:00:21.222
- I got a flat.

1029
01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:23.558
- You ride safe.

1030
01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:28.129
- When you have a
sec, we need to talk.

1031
01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:29.096
It's about work.

1032
01:00:56.625 --> 01:00:58.392
- Come
on girl, slow down.

1033
01:00:58.425 --> 01:00:59.226
Slow down.

1034
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.597
Wait.

1035
01:01:14.275 --> 01:01:17.044

whoa, whoa, whoa.

Cuts and bruises.

1081
01:03:17.298 --> 01:03:18.767
You crash your bike
at 200 miles an hour

1082
01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:20.635
and you walk away
with cuts and bruises.

1083
01:03:20.669 --> 01:03:22.771
I don't know how
you do it, kiddo.

1084
01:03:22.803 --> 01:03:24.706

01:03:28.442 --> 01:03:30.779
do a brain scan I think,

1088
01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:32.647
make sure you still
have one in there

1089
01:03:32.681 --> 01:03:34.114
after your little tumble.

1090
01:03:36.984 --> 01:03:41.556
So, you and me, we need
to have a conversation.

1091
01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:48.530
The bike's a mess, but you can
bang metal back into shape.

1092
01:03:48.563 --> 01:03:51.865
People , not so much.

1093
01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.936
I was thinking, remember
your first go-cart?

1094
01:03:56.705 --> 01:03:57.938
- Dad, not this story again.

1095
01:03:57.971 --> 01:04:01.342
- You were
eight years old.

1096
01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:02.943
We spent months
building that thing

1097
01:04:02.976 --> 01:04:04.746
and on the day that we finished,

1098
01:04:04.779 --> 01:04:06.815
you take it to the
steepest hill in town.

1099
01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:08.783
- The steepest
hill in the suburb.

1100
01:04:08.817 --> 01:04:09.883
You always exaggerate.

1101
01:04:09.917 --> 01:04:11.118
- It was the
steepest hill in town

1102
01:04:11.151 --> 01:04:13.487
and you proceed to crash
it into a tree trying

1103
01:04:13.521 --> 01:04:17.324
to prove to some kid that
you were the fastest.

1104
01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:18.959
- He was a bully.

1105
01:04:18.992 --> 01:04:21.228
His fat ass needed to
be taught a lesson.

1106
01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:23.964
And remember, I crossed
the finish line first.

1107
01:04:25.933 --> 01:04:28.969
And maybe if someone
had put a shoot on,

1108
01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:30.538
I would've slowed down.

1109
01:04:30.572 --> 01:04:32.841
- Oh, so that was my fault.

1110
01:04:32.873 --> 01:04:33.907
I'm sorry.

1111
01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:37.978
- I'm not a kid anymore, Pop.

1112
01:04:39.781 --> 01:04:41.482
- No, I know you're not.

1113
01:04:43.651 --> 01:04:45.319
But you're still
the same person.

1114
01:04:46.654 --> 01:04:47.555
Nothing's changing that.

1115
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:48.790
Nothing should change that

1116
01:04:48.823 --> 01:04:52.594
because age takes
the edge off of ya.

1117
01:04:54.328 --> 01:04:56.564
Makes you less curious,
less, I don't know,

1118
01:04:57.866 --> 01:04:59.768
I guess it keeps ya from
doing stupid stuff, I guess,

1119
01:04:59.801 --> 01:05:03.971
but I kinda forgot who you are.

1120
01:05:04.972 --> 01:05:08.342
Tryin' to be a protective
parent and all that,

1121
01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:11.111
I forgot that you
are my daughter.

1122
01:05:12.479 --> 01:05:13.080
You're born to run.

1123
01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:14.181
It's in your blood.

1124
01:05:15.115 --> 01:05:17.985
And I just want
you to know, Holly,

1125
01:05:18.787 --> 01:05:20.688
I'm not standing in
your way any longer.

1126
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:23.290
You didn't crash and burn today

1127
01:05:23.323 --> 01:05:24.592
because you pushed it too hard.

1128
01:05:24.626 --> 01:05:28.328
You crashed because the
world can't keep up with you.

1129
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:31.131
And that's the way it should be.

1130
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.301
That's how we make a difference.

1131
01:05:35.469 --> 01:05:38.439
That's what makes
some of us pioneers,

1132
01:05:38.472 --> 01:05:41.208
and some of us just
sticks in the mud.

1133
01:05:46.313 --> 01:05:48.048
- You have no idea how
much it means to me

1134
01:05:48.081 --> 01:05:49.349
to hear you say that.

1135
01:05:51.351 --> 01:05:54.021
- Believe me, I do
because I have fallen

1136
01:05:54.054 --> 01:05:56.990
into that trap of slowing
down way too much myself.

1137
01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:41.335
- Hm.

1138
01:06:48.977 --> 01:06:50.745

01:06:50.778 --> 01:06:52.780

to build a watertight

1175

- I don't trust contracts

1181

Too much small print

1188
01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:38.211
It feels like the old West,
but it's not the old West.

1189

I long for the simple
days, you know?

1190
01:09:48.656 --> 01:09:50.758
When I, as the
sheriff of the town,

1191
01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:54.128
I wouldn't need to
do all this paperwork

1192
01:09:54.162 --> 01:09:55.930
to handle a problem like you.

1193
01:09:57.297 --> 01:09:59.600
I would just need a
revolver and a bullet.

1194
01:10:00.968 --> 01:10:04.304
- You need to stop blowin' hot
air up your tight little ass.

1195
01:10:04.337 --> 01:10:06.007
Yeah, back then it was simpler.

1196
01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.008
You got that right.

1197
01:10:08.009 --> 01:10:11.311
But back then, the sheriff
was on the side of the people.

1198
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.981
Today you just work
for corporations.

1199
01:10:15.016 --> 01:10:17.585
And if the world was right and
you were serving up justice,

1200
01:10:17.618 --> 01:10:20.287
you wouldn't be chasing
after people like me.

1201
01:10:21.421 --> 01:10:22.890
And regardless of the era,

1202
01:10:24.092 --> 01:10:26.293
it's always harder to
hit a moving target.

1203
01:10:27.095 --> 01:10:29.296
So, come catch me if you can.

1204
01:10:36.671 --> 01:10:37.505

1208
01:11:20.047 --> 01:11:23.117
- They say she's a
shape-shifting witch looking

1209
01:11:23.151 --> 01:11:25.586
for revenge on the
people who wronged her.

1210
01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.455
- The only
reason I'm not arresting you

1211
01:11:28.488 --> 01:11:30.258
is because in the
grand scheme of things,

1212
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:32.960
you're worth diddly squat

- So, when are
you gonna pay me another visit?

1214
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:38.298
- Nothing in
life comes for free.

1215
01:11:38.331 --> 01:11:40.668
Every favor comes with a debt.

1216
01:11:40.701 --> 01:11:43.638
Every criminal act,
subject to karma.

1217
01:11:44.906 --> 01:11:46.808

01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:53.875

don't ya think, Hol?

1235
01:13:05.152 --> 01:13:06.386

1236
01:13:06.419 --> 01:13:08.990
are gonna be spending
more time together?

1237
01:13:09.023 --> 01:13:11.292
- Yeah.

1238
01:13:11.325 --> 01:13:13.561
- But you'll be
just fine, Holly.

1239
01:13:14.862 --> 01:13:17.365
- I don't know if I need
to go right or left,

1240
01:13:17.397 --> 01:13:18.566
forwards or backwards,

1241
01:13:18.599 --> 01:13:22.502
but this isn't workin'
for me here, Dad.

1242
01:13:22.536 --> 01:13:25.039
- It's not working for
a lot of people, Holly.

1243
01:13:26.374 --> 01:13:31.579
Listen, kiddo,
you gave it your best shot

1244
01:13:32.747 --> 01:13:34.447
and I'm sorry it's all
uphill for your generation.

1245
01:13:34.481 --> 01:13:36.717
But you do whatever
you need to do

1246
01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:38.920
to even out the
playing field, hear me?

1247
01:13:42.455 --> 01:13:46.661
- I guess we'll
keep in touch.

1248
01:13:46.694 --> 01:13:47.528
- Okay.

1249
01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:52.833
You know, I told
myself I came here

1250
01:13:54.268 --> 01:13:57.437
for some spare parts
but I really think
I came here looking,

1251
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:58.372
I really think I
came you're looking

1252
01:13:58.406 --> 01:13:59.840
for the man I used to be, Hol.

1253
01:14:02.475 --> 01:14:03.945
And I'd rather lose
you for six months

1254
01:14:03.978 --> 01:14:05.379
then have you lose
your edge forever

1255
01:14:05.413 --> 01:14:06.614
because the last thing I want

1256
01:14:06.647 --> 01:14:08.616
is my little girl slowing down.

1257
01:14:11.819 --> 01:14:14.522
- I'm gonna go faster
than you've ever seen.

1258
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:19.293
- And I'm gonna be
cheering for you.

1259
01:14:19.327 --> 01:14:23.030
For both of you.

1260
01:14:25.433 --> 01:14:28.769
You know, Hol,

1261
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:33.007
ditch the 'burb soon as you can.

1262
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.208
It just don't suit you.

1263
01:14:36.344 --> 01:14:37.144
- Deal.

1264
01:15:14.448 --> 01:15:15.349
- Hey.

1265
01:15:15.383 --> 01:15:16.417
I'm gonna ask you something

1266
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.284
and you have to be
straight with me.

1267
01:15:17.318 --> 01:15:18.085
- Always.

1268
01:15:18.119 --> 01:15:19.520
What?

1269
01:15:19.553 --> 01:15:20.955
- If I can't keep running
meds, what happens?

1270
01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:23.424
- As long as there's
demand, the vacuum fills.

1271
01:15:23.457 --> 01:15:25.292
If not by me than somebody else.

1272
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.362
Do you wanna quit? Is this
because of what I did?

1273
01:15:28.396 --> 01:15:29.597
Because I'm sorry.

1274
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:30.831
Listen, I know I
crossed the line-

1275
01:15:30.865 --> 01:15:32.666
- No, Renzo, this has
nothing to do with you.

1276
01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.603
I kept taking the money and
now the feds are on to me.

1277
01:15:37.805 --> 01:15:39.640
- So, you're leavin'?

1278
01:15:39.673 --> 01:15:42.109
- Yeah, we're headed
straight for the border.

1279
01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:44.211
Do you know if you can-

1280
01:15:44.245 --> 01:15:45.746
- Get you meds in Mexico?

1281
01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.547
Yeah.

1282
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.815
Look, I can make
sure Shelby gets

1283
01:15:47.848 --> 01:15:50.451
the best healthcare he's
ever had in his life, okay?

1284
01:15:50.484 --> 01:15:51.752
But there's no way you
get through a checkpoint

1285
01:15:51.786 --> 01:15:53.554
if you're on a wanted list.

1286
01:15:54.655 --> 01:15:55.689
Wait right there.

1287
01:15:58.527 --> 01:15:59.528
- Good, bud?

1288
01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:05.332
No, no, no, Renzo, I can't.
I don't know how to use it.

1289
01:16:05.366 --> 01:16:08.069
- I know, I know, you don't
have to. I'm going with you.

1290
01:16:08.102 --> 01:16:10.571
I can show you a way through
and I can protect you.

1291
01:16:10.604 --> 01:16:12.773
- You don't have to do this
after what I said to you.

1292
01:16:12.807 --> 01:16:15.676
- Truth be told I'd have
done this the day I met you.

1293
01:16:16.545 --> 01:16:17.711
All right? Let's go.

1294
01:16:21.449 --> 01:16:23.317
- Hey, you were right.

1295
01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:26.087
I am the wild horse.

1296
01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.455
- I know.

1297
01:16:31.192 --> 01:16:32.460
- Seatbelt on?
- Yeah.

1298
01:16:57.552 --> 01:16:58.853
- Connolly.

1299
01:16:58.886 --> 01:17:02.256
- You are not going to believe
who I'm tailing right now.

1300
01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:05.159
Renzo Romeo.

1301
01:17:10.498 --> 01:17:12.032
- You're on Renzo
Romeo right now?

1302
01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:13.834
- He's on a
nice little road trip

1303
01:17:13.868 --> 01:17:15.069
with almost no protection.

1304
01:17:15.102 --> 01:17:16.538
I mean, do you have
any idea how long

1305
01:17:16.571 --> 01:17:17.671
I've been searching for
this guy and then boom,

1306
01:17:17.705 --> 01:17:19.173
like that, he's in my lap?
- Yeah, okay.

1307
01:17:19.206 --> 01:17:20.441
Hey, keep tabs on him.

1308
01:17:20.474 --> 01:17:21.275
I'm gonna make a phone-

1309
01:17:21.308 --> 01:17:22.309
- Tabs on him?

1310
01:17:22.343 --> 01:17:23.545
No, I've got a team ready to go

1311
01:17:23.578 --> 01:17:25.614
if these guys even think
of heading to Vegas.

1312
01:17:25.646 --> 01:17:26.881
- Jackson, listen to me,

1313
01:17:26.914 --> 01:17:28.649
you are not to lay a
hand on Renzo Romeo

1314
01:17:28.682 --> 01:17:29.917
until I give you the all clear.

1315
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:31.752
Is that understood? I
have to make a phone call.

1316
01:17:31.785 --> 01:17:33.287
There are politics involved.

1317
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.624
- Oh my God, I am so sick of
hearing about the politics.

1318
01:17:35.656 --> 01:17:36.625
Just let me do my job.

1319
01:17:36.657 --> 01:17:38.560
- And you let me do mine!

1320
01:17:38.593 --> 01:17:40.794
You listen to what
I tell you to do.

1321
01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:42.863
You follow my orders, you grunt!

1322
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:50.905
- Tommy?

1323
01:17:51.705 --> 01:17:53.007
- Over here.

1324
01:17:56.243 --> 01:17:57.077
- Tommy?

1325
01:17:59.813 --> 01:18:01.148
What happened?

1326
01:18:01.182 --> 01:18:03.684
Shelby, please, go
look at the bikes.

1327
01:18:03.717 --> 01:18:05.319
Are you okay?

1328
01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:06.521
Wow.

1329
01:18:06.555 --> 01:18:07.788
- We haven't met yet.

1330
01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:09.790
- Renzo.

1331
01:18:09.823 --> 01:18:11.058
- Renzo.

1332
01:18:11.091 --> 01:18:13.662
- Tommy, we have to get
you to the hospital.

1333
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:15.496
Who did this?

1334
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:16.864
- Some heavies.

1335
01:18:16.897 --> 01:18:18.365
Showed up asking about you.

1336
01:18:19.833 --> 01:18:21.835
They said they wanna
send a message.

1337
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:25.940
Needless to say I might've had
something to say about that.

1338
01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:30.377
- You're the best guard dog
a girl could ever ask for.

1339
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:32.346
You know that?

1340
01:18:32.379 --> 01:18:33.881
- Those were Maxwell's men.

1341
01:18:33.914 --> 01:18:36.750
Looks like you got two
bounties on your head now.

1342
01:18:37.885 --> 01:18:39.320
- I'm under the impression

1343
01:18:39.353 --> 01:18:41.322
that you might be in a
spot of trouble.

1344
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.858
- You could say that.

1345
01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.564
I think we're gonna lay
low in Mexico for awhile.

1346
01:18:49.598 --> 01:18:50.731
- Oh, yeah?

1347
01:18:50.764 --> 01:18:53.500
I'll have to come visit
once I feel better

1348
01:18:53.535 --> 01:18:56.303
'cause I think you owe me a
truck load of tacos and beans.

1349
01:18:57.672 --> 01:18:58.673
Ow.

1350
01:18:58.707 --> 01:18:59.940
Yes, please.

1351
01:19:00.675 --> 01:19:02.409
- If they were here
looking for you,

1352
01:19:02.443 --> 01:19:05.446
why did they feel the
need to leave so fast?

1353
01:19:08.749 --> 01:19:10.017
- I have to go.

1354
01:19:10.685 --> 01:19:11.919
- Then go.

1355
01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.856
- I love you.

1356
01:19:15.889 --> 01:19:17.592
- I love you.

1357
01:19:17.626 --> 01:19:18.792
- Come on.

1358
01:19:18.826 --> 01:19:20.094
- I love you.

1359
01:19:21.295 --> 01:19:22.796
- I'm waiting.

1360
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:24.965
We literally have
them surrounded.

1361
01:19:24.999 --> 01:19:26.233
- You're good to go.

1362
01:19:27.034 --> 01:19:28.836
Light 'em up if you have to.

1363
01:19:29.738 --> 01:19:31.005
- There's a kid in there.

1364
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:32.973
- Mm hm.

1365
01:19:34.775 --> 01:19:36.645
How terrible.

1366
01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:04.938
- Night Train, bitch.

1367
01:20:05.839 --> 01:20:06.708
- Secure the area.

1368
01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:07.742
I'm on them.

1369
01:20:28.829 --> 01:20:30.331
- Hang on, Shelby, okay?

1370
01:20:30.364 --> 01:20:31.365
Hang onto something.

1371
01:20:41.576 --> 01:20:42.711
- Okay.

1372
01:20:42.744 --> 01:20:45.412
Please, tell me that
was intentional, yeah?

1373
01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:07.468
- Sorry, Officer.

1374
01:21:07.501 --> 01:21:08.936
Foot came off the brake.

1375
01:21:12.741 --> 01:21:13.541
- Thanks, Dad.

1376
01:21:32.993 --> 01:21:34.294
What the hell is that?

1377
01:21:36.598 --> 01:21:37.364
- It's Maxwell's men.

1378
01:21:37.398 --> 01:21:38.265
Go, go.

1379
01:21:39.299 --> 01:21:41.135
- Shelby, get down on
the floorboard, okay?

1380
01:21:41.168 --> 01:21:42.570
I need you to stay down.

1381
01:21:42.604 --> 01:21:44.071
You gotta stay on the
floorboard, all right?

1382
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:49.811
- He'll kill us out here.

1383
01:21:49.844 --> 01:21:50.678
Come on.

1384
01:21:53.013 --> 01:21:54.783
You okay, kid?

1385
01:21:54.816 --> 01:21:56.016
Stay down.

1386
01:22:07.928 --> 01:22:08.996
- Hold on, Shelby.

1387
01:22:48.536 --> 01:22:49.637
I can't outrun that.

1388
01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:51.338
I can't out run it.

1389
01:22:53.575 --> 01:22:54.609
- Keep it steady.

1390
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:58.947
- Shelby, stay down, okay?

1391
01:23:13.962 --> 01:23:14.896
You okay?

1392
01:23:14.929 --> 01:23:15.864
Are you okay?

1393
01:23:29.677 --> 01:23:32.312
Well, you did say you'd
get us to the border.

1394
01:23:33.313 --> 01:23:35.048
- I'm not stopping
there, all right?

1395
01:23:35.082 --> 01:23:36.283
I'm comin' with you.

1396
01:23:37.251 --> 01:23:39.854
- You wanna hitch
your wagon to this?

1397
01:23:39.888 --> 01:23:41.623
- If you'll let me, yeah.

1398
01:23:44.191 --> 01:23:47.194
- Well, prepare for your life
to get a whole lot wilder.

1399
01:23:47.896 --> 01:23:50.330
- I can handle that.

1400
01:23:54.636 --> 01:23:55.837
- Oh, that's bad.

1401
01:24:45.085 --> 01:24:50.290
- Seems, uh, seems you
underestimated me, huh?

1402
01:24:52.092 --> 01:24:55.495
You see, I've been
staking out this rat hole

1403
01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:59.333
for over a year in
the hopes that maybe,

1404
01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:03.203
maybe one day this
guy would pop up.

1405
01:25:03.236 --> 01:25:06.340
Look at you two.

1406
01:25:06.373 --> 01:25:09.811
It's wild how things
come together, ain't it?

1407
01:25:09.844 --> 01:25:10.945
- It is.

1408
01:25:10.979 --> 01:25:12.714
Why don't you keep
that gun on me, huh?

1409
01:25:12.747 --> 01:25:14.214
- Not a problem, Renzo.

1410
01:25:14.247 --> 01:25:19.386
Oh, let's be honest, you're
not much of a threat, are you?

1411
01:25:20.454 --> 01:25:21.623
- Try me.

1412
01:25:21.656 --> 01:25:23.190
- I read every
report we have on you

1413
01:25:23.223 --> 01:25:26.226
and you've never actually
had the guts to kill anyone.

1414
01:25:27.829 --> 01:25:32.165
- And yet here I am, top
of your most wanted list.

1415
01:25:33.668 --> 01:25:35.135
- Yep, here you are.

1416
01:25:35.168 --> 01:25:38.539
You're a smuggler, okay?

1417
01:25:38.573 --> 01:25:41.208
You wanna kill gang
bangers, have at it.

1418
01:25:41.241 --> 01:25:43.243
You'd be doing me a favor.

1419
01:25:43.276 --> 01:25:45.113
You start messing with
the economy, though,

1420
01:25:45.145 --> 01:25:46.279
we got a problem.

1421
01:25:47.048 --> 01:25:48.382
- Listen, I'll come
with you right now

1422
01:25:48.415 --> 01:25:50.450
and they walk, all right?

1423
01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:52.419
- You care about
their safety now?

1424
01:25:54.522 --> 01:25:55.355
Is that right?

1425
01:25:58.191 --> 01:25:59.292
How about this?

1426
01:26:01.062 --> 01:26:02.697
You don't do
contracts, I get it.

1427
01:26:04.464 --> 01:26:07.001
But you and I, we can
still make a deal.

1428
01:26:07.035 --> 01:26:08.468
You testify that this guy forced

1429
01:26:08.502 --> 01:26:10.170
you into this and
I give you my word

1430
01:26:10.203 --> 01:26:13.107
you will be looked after,
new identity, house,

1431
01:26:13.141 --> 01:26:15.843
everything the kid
needs, all taken care of.

1432
01:26:18.178 --> 01:26:19.413
What do ya say?

1433
01:26:24.418 --> 01:26:26.219
- I can do better than that.

1434
01:26:27.354 --> 01:26:28.623
- Oh, yeah?

1435
01:26:29.924 --> 01:26:32.026
- You know, I've been thinking,

1436
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.295
you and I, we're kinda the same.

1437
01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:39.199
You're tired, too, right?

1438
01:26:39.232 --> 01:26:41.268
Because I'm exhausted.

1439
01:26:43.037 --> 01:26:44.972
We're both running
as hard as we can.

1440
01:26:46.741 --> 01:26:49.744
The only difference
is that I'm running

1441
01:26:49.777 --> 01:26:50.878
towards something good,

1442
01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.047
and I get the feeling
that you're running

1443
01:26:53.081 --> 01:26:54.281
away from something bad.

1444
01:26:58.653 --> 01:27:01.421
- Wow.

1445
01:27:02.156 --> 01:27:04.424
All right, you got me there.

1446
01:27:06.194 --> 01:27:07.962
- I can give you a bigger fish,

1447
01:27:09.063 --> 01:27:11.498
somebody that's
actually worth chasing.

1448
01:27:12.399 --> 01:27:15.302
And you said it
yourself, I'm a nobody.

1449
01:27:16.303 --> 01:27:19.439
I'm diddly squat in
this case, remember?

1450
01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.110
And you mean to tell
me that you signed up

1451
01:27:22.143 --> 01:27:23.611
for this job so
that you could chase

1452
01:27:23.644 --> 01:27:25.813
somebody smuggling
medical supplies?

1453
01:27:26.848 --> 01:27:27.682
- Wow.

1454
01:27:28.883 --> 01:27:31.853
That is a hell
of a lot of psychoanalyzing

1455
01:27:31.886 --> 01:27:33.286
you got goin' on there.

1456
01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:38.726
Who are you offering?

1457
01:27:41.596 --> 01:27:42.429
- Stay here.

1458
01:27:48.136 --> 01:27:49.036
Maxwell.

1459
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.904
- Mm.

1460
01:27:51.239 --> 01:27:52.472
Interesting.

1461
01:27:54.075 --> 01:27:55.910
What ya got for me?

1462
01:27:55.943 --> 01:27:57.277
- Are you gonna let us pass?

1463
01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:00.447
- Maybe, it's hard to say
without seeing the goods first.

1464
01:28:01.582 --> 01:28:03.751
- I want something from you.

1465
01:28:03.785 --> 01:28:05.285
- Hm.

1466
01:28:05.318 --> 01:28:07.487
- I wanna know what it is
that you're running from.

1467
01:28:07.522 --> 01:28:12.727
- Did this just
become a therapy session?

1468
01:28:13.393 --> 01:28:14.394
Is that what's happening?

1469
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:17.131
- Do you want Maxwell or not?

1470
01:28:31.478 --> 01:28:34.347
- I executed
a family in cold blood

1471
01:28:34.381 --> 01:28:36.316
and I'm not proud of it.

1472
01:28:39.787 --> 01:28:42.523
They told
me I had to do it

1473
01:28:42.557 --> 01:28:44.491
because they messed up.

1474
01:28:47.228 --> 01:28:48.863
They had bad intelligence.

1475
01:28:50.363 --> 01:28:52.633
So, an innocent family
had to die at my hands

1476
01:28:52.667 --> 01:28:57.872
and I get to look at them
every time I close my eyes.

1477
01:29:10.017 --> 01:29:11.719
Oh, damn it!

1478
01:29:15.156 --> 01:29:15.990
There ya go.

1479
01:29:16.824 --> 01:29:17.825
You happy now?

1480
01:29:23.231 --> 01:29:26.466
- This is my son, Shelby.

1481
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:30.004
He's my everything.

1482
01:29:31.772 --> 01:29:34.441
And by laws of science,
he shouldn't exist.

1483
01:29:35.442 --> 01:29:36.443
But here he is.

1484
01:29:38.346 --> 01:29:39.313
Nobody can explain it to me

1485
01:29:39.347 --> 01:29:42.683
but I have my own little theory.

1486
01:29:44.085 --> 01:29:48.455
I think that when something
innocent is killed,

1487
01:29:49.456 --> 01:29:51.559
something pure takes its place.

1488
01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:56.030
And it might help you
to see it that way, too.

1489
01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.148
Oh, damn.

1490
01:30:15.783 --> 01:30:18.719
This is , this is
pretty embarrassing.

1491
01:30:24.258 --> 01:30:25.393
I sure hope whatever you have

1492
01:30:25.425 --> 01:30:27.628
on Mr. Maxwell is worthwhile.

1493
01:30:30.698 --> 01:30:33.968
- I've been going through
people's trash my whole life.

1494
01:30:34.001 --> 01:30:37.571
So, trust me when I say I
know where to find dirt.

1495
01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:57.124
You did good, girl.

1496
01:30:59.427 --> 01:31:00.561
You did damn good.

1497
01:31:02.964 --> 01:31:04.031
Come on, bud.

1498
01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:10.671
Hey.

1499
01:31:13.407 --> 01:31:14.442
Give him hell.

1500
01:31:40.067 --> 01:31:41.235
- Connolly.

1501
01:32:12.133 --> 01:32:13.701
- So, full disclosure,

1502
01:32:14.668 --> 01:32:17.538
I kinda planned to cross
the border with ya,

1503
01:32:17.571 --> 01:32:18.639
so I called ahead.

1504
01:32:21.409 --> 01:32:22.777
- Now, that's cool.

1505
01:32:27.481 --> 01:32:28.315
- How'd I do?

1506
01:32:29.216 --> 01:32:30.317
- You did good.

1507
01:32:30.351 --> 01:32:31.152
- Yeah?

1508
01:32:31.185 --> 01:32:32.019
- Yeah.

1509
01:32:34.188 --> 01:32:36.023
- Ugh, so not cool.

1510
01:32:52.573 --> 01:32:54.041
- Okay.

1511
01:32:57.878 --> 01:33:02.216
I was thinking maybe we could
slow things down a little.

1512
01:33:04.318 --> 01:33:06.487
- Never gonna happen.

1513
01:33:07.354 --> 01:33:08.523
Ready?

1514
01:33:08.557 --> 01:33:09.590
- Ready.

1515
01:33:19.934 --> 01:33:20.935
Oh, yeah.
