00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.170
- <i> And of course I set it to</i>
<i>Icelandic time because we share</i>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.280
<i>a love of the aurora borealis,</i>
<i>Gordy.</i>

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.440
<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>how to tell time.</i>

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.850
-- <i> Great gift, Dad.</i>

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.680
<i>Way to think things through.</i>

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.350
<i>Somehow, you'd think that a man</i>

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.450
<i>who can send a rocket</i>
<i>into space would be able</i>

8
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.190
<i>to manage a halfway decent</i>
<i>birthday present.</i>

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.420
<i>-Nope.</i>

10
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.130
- <i> You know, Gordy,</i>
<i>all things considered,</i>

11
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.360
<i>maybe my gift</i>
<i>isn't so bad after all.</i>

12
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.830
<i> Hey, Gordy. Surprise!</i>

13
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.330
<i>Wow! Now, there's a gift.</i>

14
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.500
<i>Here you go, Gordy.</i>

15
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.010
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

16
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.470
<i>Oh, beautiful, Haley.</i>

17
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.610
Good morning on what is

18
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.020
sure to be a windy one.

19
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.790
We have a high wind warning

20
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.400
for the L.A. County coast
and valleys

21
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.800
with some clouds sure to
come in around 00 a.m.

22
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.230
And even though the high gust
warning will, expire

23
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.770
mid to late morning,
you'll still want to keep...

24
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.070
The searchm for a group of missing hikers

25
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.610
is set to resume this morning
just outside Agua Dulce.

26
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.740
The tour group went out
two days ago

27
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.740
and on the Pacific Crest Trail

28
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.220
but didn't come back
as expected that night.

29
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.050
Crews started searching
yesterday morning...

30
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.220
And traffic is already backed up

31
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.290
due to an accident
on the southbound 101.

32
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.990
It is 44 with Bo and Ives.

33
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.460
Bang.

34
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.680
Bang.

35
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.010
Bang.

36
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.610
Come on.

37
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.350
Down, down.

38
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.860
Down, down, down.

39
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.320
Bang! Yes, a good boy.

40
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.130
Up. Up, up.

41
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.290
Okay, up. Up, up.

42
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.660
Got to keep our heads up
out the clouds on this one.

43
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.590
I know.

44
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.600
Now, we land this...

45
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.050
Yeah. Like<i> Six Guns.</i>

46
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.510
I mean, we really put on a show,

47
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.350
well, you know they're gonna
bring us back for the sequel.

48
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.860
Well, we sure as hell ain't
got to sell no more horses.

49
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.150
So just execute.

50
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.300
And we ain't got
no more problems. Mm.

51
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.500
You good?

52
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.940
You good?

53
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.980
Where your sister?

54
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.150
What's that about?

55
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.850
-She's supposed to be here.
-Yeah.

56
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.030
Goddamn it.

57
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.770
Thought I told you
to fix the damn walker.

58
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.950
You hear that?

59
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.540
Pops.

60
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.830
- Come on, come on. Pop.
- Firefly.

61
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.670
- What else? What else?
- Ghost.

62
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.570
Beethoven.

63
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.240
-Commodore.
-Yeah.

64
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.770
Virgil.

65
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.310
You good. You good.

66
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.970
- You good. You good.

67
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.420
You good, man. You good.

68
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.610
-Ghost.
-You good. You good. You good.

69
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.250
- Pops?
- Lucky.

70
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.450
- Pops. Pops.
- Commodore.

71
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.820
Pops!

72
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.130
OJ.

73
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.800
Oh. Hi, horsie.

74
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.430
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't
look him in the eyes, please.

75
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.230
You ready to do
the safety meeting?

76
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.960
I'm gonna need like five...

77
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.930
my team's almost here.

78
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.310
Your team's not here.

79
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.010
- Okay. Hold.

80
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.980
Sorry, I got the horse guy
talking to me, too.

81
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.010
- What's up? Copy.
- Safety meeting at the...

82
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.850
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Bonnie Clayton on set.

83
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.080
- Here she is, everybody.

84
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.780
- Take a look at all of that.

85
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.020
- Fynn, this is OJ,
our horse trainer.

86
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.850
You remember these guys
from<i> Flash Point.</i>

87
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.290
Yeah. Hi.

88
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.020
Your name is OJ?

89
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.940
Yeah, Otis Junior.

90
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.840
Where's the o-- the other guy?

91
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.000
- The-the-the senior guy?
- Dude, he died.

92
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.680
About six months ago.

93
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.810
A bunch of random shit
fell out of a plane.

94
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.780
So I guess we're stuck
with Junior over here.

95
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.810
- No.
- Yeah.

96
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.550
Fuck. Great.

97
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.350
Ant, how we looking?

98
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.390
Yeah, good, if we're selling
a horse's ass.

99
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.960
That's..

100
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.960
legendary cinematographer
Antlers Holst over here...

101
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.400
Let's go ahead
and spin the horse.

102
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.170
But you had said "hold," so...

103
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.010
- And now I'm saying "spin."
Let's go.

104
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.070
- Great. And while that's
spinning, can we get makeup?

105
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.080
- Get makeup for
Ms. Bonnie Clayton, please.

106
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.470
Hold on.

107
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.380
Can you step away
from the back, please?

108
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.680
They told me to come here.

109
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.550
Good call, OJ.
Um, tell you what,

110
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.550
let's do a quick safety meeting.

111
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.490
Guys, this is OJ,
our horse trainer.

112
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.750
Take it away.

113
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.530
Kill the music, please.

114
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.740
My name is OJ. Uh...

115
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.240
I think my sister's
gonna be here in a minute.

116
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.610
- Little louder, please.
We cannot hear you in the back.

117
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.040
I said we are animal wranglers

118
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.050
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

119
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.850
And... did you know
the very first,  assem...

120
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.050
Hey, yo!

121
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.860
Excuse me. Sorry.

122
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.890
I'm so sorry about that.
Let me do that.

123
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.250
Sorry, brother.

124
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.060
- Safety meeting.
- Yeah.

125
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.370
Hello! How y'all doing?

126
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.930
Sorry for the tardiness.

127
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.900
My name is Emerald, that's OJ,

128
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.770
and we are
your animal wranglers today

129
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.570
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

130
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.040
Now, did you know
that the very first

131
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.970
assembly of photographs
in sequential order

132
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.710
to create a motion picture

133
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.050
was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?

134
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.920
Yes, it was. Yes, it was.
Look it up.

135
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.250
Now, I know you guys know
Eadweard Muybridge,

136
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.960
the grandfather
of motion pictures

137
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.930
who took the pictures
that created that clip,

138
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.990
but does anybody know the name
of the Black jockey

139
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.560
that rode the horse?

140
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.460
Nope? I mean,
the very first stuntman,

141
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.140
animal wrangler and movie star
all rolled into one,

142
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.230
and there is literally
no record of him.

143
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.010
That man was a Bahamian jockey

144
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.410
that went by the name
of Alistair E. Haywood.

145
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.640
And he is
my great-great-grandfather.

146
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.080
- Great.
- There's another "great" grandfather.

147
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.020
That's why
back at the Haywood Ranch,

148
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.320
as the only Black-owned
horse trainers in Hollywood,

149
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.460
we like to say, "Since the
moment pictures could move,

150
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.460
we had skin in the game."

151
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.190
All right, let's get into
some,  safety precautions

152
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.970
while we're on set, shall we?

153
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.130
Number one, please refrain
from making any loud noises,

154
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.800
sudden movements,
and keep your cell phones off.

155
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.440
We'd really appreciate that.

156
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.270
Two, if you see anything
that looks or feels unsafe,

157
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.940
contact me, OJ or your second
in chain of command.

158
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.610
And three,
let's have a great shoot!

159
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.610
...and I'm Emerald Haywood.

160
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.280
I direct, write, produce, act.

161
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.110
I do a little...

162
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.480
...motorcycles, baby.

163
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.820
Look, I-I make
a mean grilled cheese

164
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.120
if you're looking for crafty.

165
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.830
-Just-just holler at me.

166
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.990
Okay, that was great.

167
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.400
That was... that was a lot.

168
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.160
...let's do a rehearsal.

169
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.290
- Yeah? Rehearsal?
- Rehearsing, we should.

170
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.040
We should do one. Rehearsing.

171
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.900
I think...
I think he might need a break.

172
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.170
Yeah, we'll rehearse one first,

173
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.360
and then break, yeah?

174
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.840
Well, I'm ready to do one.

175
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.240
- OJ, she's...
she's ready to do one.

176
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.870
Tell the horse
we're ready to do one.

177
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.580
VFX, can we get the ball
in here while we have a sec?

178
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.910
- Em.
- VFX and, OJ,

179
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.140
you can... you can step off.

180
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.380
Step out. Step off.

181
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.550
- Yeah, yeah.
- step out.

182
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.150
What's the horse's name?

183
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.720
- Lucky.
- Lucky.

184
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.490
- Is he?
- VFX!

185
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.000
Yeah. Em?

186
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.820
- OJ, let's step off.
- You calling me?

187
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.160
- I'm trying to work.

188
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.020
- What'd I tell you
about that, man?

189
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.700
- Hey, man, if she can't
get near the back of the horse,

190
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.200
- what are we doing here?

191
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.670
- Medic.

192
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.410
-Are you okay?

193
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.390
- <i> Look,</i>
<i>maybe it's just too soon?</i>

194
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.020
<i>Yeah, it's not the gig.</i>
<i>Not ready yet.</i>

195
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.890
Right?

196
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.590
- We need it, man.
- No, I know.

197
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.590
Your dad left an enormous hole.
I know that.

198
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.700
But don't worry,
there'll be others.

199
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.370
All right? I'm sorry.

200
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.730
- And...
- Sorry.

201
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.260
Just, you tell her sorry.

202
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.930
Thank you for the opportunity.

203
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.270
Come on, now.

204
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.740
Oh, where's VFX?

205
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.940
Oh, all right. You got it.

206
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.110
- Sorry, that was...

207
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.110
So, where am I dropping you?

208
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.110
- I'm a go up with you.

209
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.220
I need to get some shit.

210
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.120
My little girl said, you know,
I could crash at her place,

211
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.890
so I'll be gone in the morning.

212
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.760
So I'm gonna drive you back
tomorrow?

213
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.760
I can find a ride.

214
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.800
But, I mean, like, can I get
fun OJ out this bitch?

215
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.790
'Cause this wack-ass OJ

216
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.500
is really making me feel
like I'm not loved.

217
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.070
Is that how you want
your little sister to feel?

218
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.900
What happened to Gold Rush?

219
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.200
Gold Rush went bankrupt.

220
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.040
It's been this for three years.

221
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.740
- Damn.
- Howdy, folks.

222
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.040

Go on,

226

Cowboys and cowgirls,

227
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.010
just a little heads-up.

- Come on over

231
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.190
Get your ice-cold sarsaparilla.

232
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.060
- Look at this. I've never
seen anything like it.

233
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.840
- Oh, shi...
- Come on.

234
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.500
I'm sorry, y'all. I'm sorry.

235
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.940
- Photo bomb.
- You ruined it.

236
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.440
-Yeah, my bad.
-Gold, I tell you.

237
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.910
They got gold up in here.

238
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.280
Lucky.

239
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.780
Hang tight.

240
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.950
I'll be back.

241
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.680
Let's go.

242
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.540
How many you sold?

243
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.100
How many?

244
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.980
Ten.

245
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.650
You sold ten of Pops' horses?

246
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.310
I'm gonna get 'em back.

247
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.580
- Can you stay out here?
- Why?

248
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.420
I'm developing
a business relationship,

249
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.990
and you're a liability
right now.

250
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.280
How am I a liability?

251
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.720
How are you a lia...

252
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.160
Don't promote your fucking
side shit on the job.

253
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.320
- Oh, my God.
- Actor, singer, dancer,

254
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.430
seamstress, motorcycles.

255
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.630
You want to promote something,
promote this business.

256
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.240
No, OJ. No.

257
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.970
First of all, that's not
my side shit. This is.

258
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.110
And second of all, if anybody's
a liability...

259
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.370
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

260
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.250
- Hi there. It's Amber
again from Jupe's Claim.

261
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.820
It does look like we were able
to squeeze out,

262
00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.320
a couple of extra press passes

263
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.820
for the upcoming
friends and family preview.

264
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.330
No apology necessary.

265
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.760
This is in reference
to the biggest, bestest,

266
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.130
brand-new live show we have
coming up here at the park,

267
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.160
- which is sneaking up on us...
- Come in.

268
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.760
- If you'd like, I can
go ahead and put you down...

269
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.530
OJ.

270
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.940
Thanks for coming up.

271
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.770
How you doing?
This is my sister Em.

272
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.780
Hi there.

273
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.340
So, uh... who'd you bring me?

274
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.310
Lucky.

275
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.310
He's my second-best horse,
you know, uh...

276
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.180
He lost focus.

277
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.980
So, uh... I mean, I did, too,
but I can't fire myself.

278
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.690
- That's good.
- Hold up.

279
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.490
This you?

280
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.130
You literally the Asian kid
from<i> Kid Sheriff?</i>

281
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.690
- No, it's okay.

282
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.690
Yeah, I was...
I was Lil' Jupe.

283
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.700
Ah, dude, you were
literally my favorite.

284
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.330
You mind if I get
a picture real quick?

285
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.130
Hey, you mind if we talk?

286
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.470
Yes. Of course.

287
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.500
Please, browse away.

288
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.570
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

289
00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.640
Thank you. I sure will.

290
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.180
so...

291
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.180
same deal, yeah? Eleven-five?

292
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.520
- Yeah. Thank you.
- That's 3D. Yeah.

293
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.920
Whatever happened to that
Black boy? He was good.

294
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.550
Stop, stop.

295
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.360
- He was good.

296
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.090
I actually wanted to,
lay some groundwork,

297
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.260
to a pathway of-of,
buying some of them back.

298
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.670
All right?

299
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.700
- Yeah.

300
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.400
Yeah. Totally.

301
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.040
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

302
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.210
Actually, OJ,

303
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.710
the offer I made your dad
is still on the table.

304
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.110
- Let me... Let...
-Yo, wait a minute.

305
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.250
So, that...

306
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.750
OJ, have I shown you this?

307
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.120
This is in reference
to the<i> Gordy's Home</i> incident.

308
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.460
<i>Gordy's Home.</i> Yeah, yeah.

309
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.630
So,<i> Gordy's Home</i> is
a short-lived but fabled sitcom

310
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.300
I starred in in '96
after<i> Kid Sheriff</i> blew up.

311
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.030
Yeah, my pops told me
about this show.

312
00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.400
The-the monkey went crazy
or some shit.

313
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.040
You know, I usually charge
a fee for this.

314
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.720
- That's the first
exploding fist bump.

315
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.450
What? Really?

316
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.150
Y'all came up with that?

317
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.330
So, as I was saying,
<i>Gordy's Home</i> began airing

318
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.630
- in the fall of '96...

319
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.840
...and it was an immediate hit.

320
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.660
ratings were huge.

321
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.470
Pretty good reviews.

322
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.400
Just really took off.

323
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.070
Then,  one day...

324
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.010
...we were shooting an episode

325
00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.280
in season two entitled,
"Gordy's Birthday."

326
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.320
One of the chimps
that plays Gordy just...

327
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.090
just hit his limit.

328
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.630
And it was six minutes
and 13 seconds of havoc.

329
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.270
Network tried to bury hit,
but it was a spectacle.

330
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.430
People are just obsessed.

331
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.770
You're kidding me.

332
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.770
OJ, you said you heard
about that?

333
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.180
That's why
they don't let you use chimps.

334
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.510
That's part of the reason.

335
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.510
There's a growing<i> Gordy's Home</i>
fan base out there now.

336
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.190
This Dutch couple paid me 50K

337
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.850
to come in here
and spend the night.

338
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.650
I didn't ask.

339
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.020
That's crazy.

340
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.960
So, what happened really, man?

341
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.700
You haven't seen
the Bad Gordy sketch on<i> SNL?</i>

342
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.170
I mean, they pretty much
nailed it better than I could.

343
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.670
No?

344
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.070
<i>Saturday Night Live?</i>

345
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.240
Darrell Hammond as Tom.

346
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.870
Ana Gasteyer as Phyllis.

347
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.080
Cheri Oteri as Mary Jo Elliot.

348
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.420
Scott Wolf is the host.
He's me.

349
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.720
But, of course,
the star of the sketch

350
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.580
is Chris goddamn Kattan
as Gordy,

351
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.890
and he is...

352
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.030
undeniable, okay?

353
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.930
Bit goes like this.

354
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.490
Everyone's trying to celebrate
Gordy's birthday,

355
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:11.200
but every time Gordy hears
something about the jungle,

356
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.700
Gordy - Kattan - goes off.

357
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.840
And it's... it's Kattan.

358
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.050
He's just crushing it.

359
00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.080
He is a force of nature.

360
00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.420
He is killing on that stage.

361
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.550
Yeah.

362
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.690
It's legendary.

363
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.590
Legendary shit.

364
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.060
Yeah.

365
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.640
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
go ahead,

366
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.270
- look that one up on YouTube.

367
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.730
Details, you know?

368
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.300
Totally.

369
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.070
I got some work I got to do.

370
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.380
So we ain't gonna chill
tonight, nothing?

371
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.880
- You want to work?
- Hell no.

372
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.320
So,  what was the offer?

373
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.360
- Jupe?
- Yeah.

374
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.960
He offered to buy the ranch.

375
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.460
Oh, really?

376
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.430
That's interesting. How much?

377
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.330
Why?

378
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.030
'Cause... I'm trying to see
how big of a dumbass you are.

379
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.100
Big dumbass, probably.

380
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.760
So I guess you don't want
to see what's good

381
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.460
with Dad liquor cabinet,
then, huh?!

382
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.830
I got that hobby weed, too,
actually.

383
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.310
That's all you had to say, then.

384
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.770
-The hobby weed.

385
00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.510
That's all you had to say,
just let me know.

386
00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.270
You should've dropped that
at the top.

387
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.110
"I got the hobby weed."
You know I'm ready.

388
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.150
Okay, your reflexes
are still quick. Like, whoa.

389
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.860
- I ain't mad at it.
- I'm watching.

390
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.890
Drink.

391
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.800
Oh, shit.

392
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.840
Remember Jean Jacket?

393
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.400
- Yeah, good horse.

394
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.550
- Supposed to be
my first horse, actually.

395
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.550
I was just talking
to my therapist about this

396
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.490
- not too long ago.
- Therapist?

397
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.190
Yes. I fuck one
on occasion sometimes.

398
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.350
I was telling her that,
for my ninth birthday,

399
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.160
I was supposed to get
to train Jean Jacket.

400
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.530
But then Pops got
some Western, and...

401
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.370
Jean Jacket wasn't mine no more.

402
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.930
Classic Otis Senior.

403
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.170
I distinctly remember...

404
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.710
...standing right here
at this window,

405
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.510
watching y'all train my horse.

406
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.050
My horse.

407
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.250
Pops never looked up at me.

408
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.020
OJ, come on.

409
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.400
But you did, nigga.

410
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.400
Remember?

411
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.900
It was<i> Scorpion King,</i> actually.

412
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.740
It wasn't a Western.

413
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.770
That was the first job
Pops took me on.

414
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.040
Wasn't much fun.

415
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.720
Ended up using camels
anyways, so...

416
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.590
The point is...

417
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.690
Yeah, fuck the point.

418
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.760
Yo, that man was
hardheaded as fuck.

419
00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:58.630
And so are you.

420
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.060
That's it.

421
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.000
But at the end of the day,
you got to...

422
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.610
you got to admit, man, Pops...

423
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.310
Pops did something
when he made this place.

424
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.120
He changed the industry.

425
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.220
That's real.

426
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.090
I can't just let that go.

427
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.420
Why is Ghost in the arena?

428
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.860
What's good?

429
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.830
Yeah.

430
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.750
Turn it down!

431
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.260
All right!

432
00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.670
Hey!

433
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.510
Where he going?

434
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.760
What if I...

435
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.360
What if I told you...

436
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.130
...you'll leave here different?

437
00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:57.140
See, every Friday
for the last six months...

438
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.450
...my family and I bore witness

439
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.850
to an absolute

440
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.750
spectacle.

441
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.320
You see it? The power?

442
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.390
Where's Ghost?

443
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.620
- I don't know.
- Hold on.

444
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.900
Boom. Power went out.

445
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.240
- See?
- Rewind.

446
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.210
Stop.

447
00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.280
Ghost talking about,
"I ain't listening.

448
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.050
I'm not trained.
I do whatever the fuck I want."

449
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.080
What?

450
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.860
What'd you see?

451
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.240
What's a bad miracle?

452
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.330
Hmm?

453
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.840
They got a word for that?

454
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.380
Nope.

455
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.210
They said it was a prop plane
or something that killed Pops.

456
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.090
That shit ain't never
made sense to me.

457
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.820
Then tonight,
I heard Ghost make a sound

458
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.320
I ain't never heard
a horse make.

459
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.520
What did you see? Hmm?

460
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.890
It was big.

461
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.900
- How big?
- Big.

462
00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.460
-What'd it look like?
- I don't know.

463
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.040
It was fast.

464
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.240
Too fast.

465
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.340
Too quiet to be a plane.

466
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.050
OJ.

467
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.710
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

468
00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.030
I'm telling you, man,
we don't need a lot.

469
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.490
We just need enough
to make our shit

470
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.760
look different
from what's out there.

471
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.160
You get what I'm saying?
Like...

472
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.790
You know I ain't trying
to run it up.

473
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.630
I just was looking online,
and I seen a lot of shit.

474
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.200
You know I'm broke, right?

475
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.700
- We'll use my money.

476
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.340
Okay, shut up. Look.

477
00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.140
All right.

478
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.110
There it is.
Five to a hundred K.

479
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.840
- Well, read it.
- You read it, dyslexic ass.

480
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.470
The point is
a website like Cyber Dominion

481
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.220
will pay five to a hundred K

482
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.620
for photographic evidence
of UFOs and shit.

483
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.620
A hundred K?

484
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.990
And that's just what I saw
on the first go.

485
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.900
Now that I'm thinking about it,
fuck Cyber Dominion.

486
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.030
This shit right here is
a moment - our moment.

487
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.030
We set it up,
release it the right way,

488
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.840
man, I'm talking
rich and famous for life.

489
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.530
How you doing? You look pretty.

490
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.170
She look like
she got a big house.

491
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.840
- How?
- How what? How we put it out?

492
00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.310
-Well, that's what I'm saying.

493
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.130
We don't just go for
the quick cash-in, okay?

494
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.670
We-we go to the most credible
platform to do the story.

495
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.550
- What's that? Like<i> Oprah?</i>
- Yeah.

496
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.580
Like<i> Oprah,</i> for example.
After that, everybody want in.

497
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:58.850
Well, I'm saying there's plenty

498
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.380
of videos of flying shit online.

499
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.190
I saw one the other day.
That wasn't on<i> Oprah.</i>

500
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.890
Nigga, I didn't say<i> Oprah.</i>
You said<i> Oprah.</i>

501
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.650
You love<i> Oprah.</i>

502
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.720
Look, all I'm saying is
all that shit online is fake.

503
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.090
Low quality. Ain't nobody
gonna get what we gonna get.

504
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.520
What we gonna get?

505
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.930
- The shot.
- What shot?

506
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.870
The shot. The money shot.

507
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.240
Undeniable, singular, the...

508
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.570
- The<i> Oprah</i> shot.
- The<i> Oprah</i> shot?

509
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.570
Excuse me.

510
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.140
Hi. I can help you over here.

511
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.840
Hi.

512
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.610
- Thank you for shopping
at Fry's.

513
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.550
Did you guys find everything
you're looking for today?

514
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.620
Yes... Angel.

515
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.290
Oh. Great.

516
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.390
Actually, do you have
a card with us?

517
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.730
No, thank you.

518
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.960
Would you like one?

519
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.590
- Because it...
- No, thank you.

520
00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:45.930
Would you like one of
our tech support personnel

521
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.290
to help you
with the installation?

522
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.100
Appreciate you.

523
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.700
All right,
no help with the install.

524
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.300
Suit yourself.

525
00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.870
Is it a hard install?

526
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.410
Well, for me, no.

527
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.940
You're not gonna
be able to do it.

528
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.980
What happened?
Did you guys get robbed?

529
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.650
- Yeah, you know.

530
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.220
A lot of blackouts.

531
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.950
Take the camera out
from time to time.

532
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.090
All these new cameras,
they have backup battery power,

533
00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.330
so you should be fine.

534
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.630
But the outages affect the
power in the battery shit, too,

535
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.660
like cell phones.

536
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.460
Okay. All right.

537
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.830
Cell phones, they don't just
drop in power. Right?

538
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.670
I mean,
maybe your Wi-Fi drops out

539
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.500
whenever your system dips.

540
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.770
So, that's technology.

541
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.810
Okay, or maybe you're in
a UFO hot spot.

542
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.780
No one believes in that.

543
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.960
What's up?

544
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.830
Damn. Did not realize
you guys were this far out.

545
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.940
I don't mind, though.

546
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.800
Smell of horse shit
and fresh air.

547
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.700
Right?

548
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.110
Look at me, man.

549
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.480
-Fuck.
-Don't do that. Don't yell.

550
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.320
Sorry, man.

551
00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.280
Sorry if I was, like, a little
shut down this morning.

552
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.480
Just got out of
a four-year relationship.

553
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.150
You were fine.

554
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.880
I know it's gonna sound
fucking cliché, all right,

555
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.190
but I thought that
she was the one, you know?

556
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.290
Is this gonna take
longer than an hour?

557
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.500
This? Oh, shit, yeah.

558
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.630
- I'm a go ahead and pop out.
- Where you going?

559
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.400
I got to go to the store
and get something.

560
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.600
Don't worry about it.
You need anything?

561
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.280
Her name was,  Rebecca Diaz.

562
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.540
Yep, keep an eye out for her.

563
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.710
She's an actress, model,
you know?

564
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.850
She booked a pilot
on The CW, so...

565
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:49.510
Yeah, fucking left me.

566
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.790
Yeah, fucking CW.

567
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.430
- So, thing about this camera...
-Actually, can it swivel up?

568
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.370
- Boom.
- Little more?

569
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.840
- More. Okay.

570
00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.540
Do you know they don't
call 'em UFOs anymore?

571
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.670
It's fucking UAPs now.

572
00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.370
Why they got to change the name?

573
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.280
Exactly.

574
00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.810
No, fuck it.
I-I'll tell you why

575
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.950
they changed the name,
all right?

576
00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.320
It-it's 'cause they want
to keep us in the dark.

577
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.320
Remember when they declassified

578
00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.890
all that UFO footage
a couple years ago?

579
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.100
Yeah. Well, people started
paying attention.

580
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.260
So they changed the name
to UAPs.

581
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.660
And no one knows
what the fuck a UAP is,

582
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.300
so everyone lost interest.

583
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.500
I saw that - that Navy clip.

584
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.840
Couldn't really see 'em, though.

585
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.270
Could've been better.

586
00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.240
It's shitty footage
of exact proof

587
00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.940
that there's
an alien civilization

588
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.650
out there in the universe.

589
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.080
So, who's that?

590
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.020
Come on, man. The little guys
with the big eyes.

591
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.080
There's lots of theories.

592
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.080
Either they're intergalactic
travelers looking for peace

593
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.330
or futuristic humans
coming back in time

594
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.530
to stop us
from destroying the planet,

595
00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.830
or they're fucking
world killers.

596
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.630
Planetary destroyers.

597
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.170
And that means that they've
been fucking watching us

598
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.310
and studying us, waiting for
the perfect time to beam us up

599
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.970
and shove metal probes
up our fucking asses.

600
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.110
Cool.

601
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.710
An-Anyway,<i> Ancient Aliens,</i>
History Channel.

602
00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.720
- Watch that shit.
- Hey!

603
00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.920
Come on! Help a nigga out!

604
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.030
Know where I could find me
a couple of big, strong fellas?

605
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.460
You good?

606
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.800
I'm good.

607
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.170
- What?
- What's that?

608
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.970
Oh, this?

609
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.050
You know, just,
training horses we ordered

610
00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.580
that I picked up.

611
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.870
-Where'd you get it from?
-Don't worry about it.

612
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.720
Now, come on, help me out.

613
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.250
Got you.

614
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.490
Okay, so... so what is that?

615
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.520
- Is it like bait?
- I told you.

616
00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.650
It is a decoy
for horse training.

617
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.160
Okay.

618
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.260
Shit. Shit.

619
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.030
- See?
- OJ.

620
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.440
We good.
I mean, he don't know shit.

621
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.870
Oh, no. You guys are doing
something shady.

622
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.110
Hey there!

623
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.770
Hey!

624
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.180
You can stay right there,
though!

625
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.250
Sure!

626
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.580
What's up?

627
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.420
We're setting up a decoy!

628
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.090
For horse training!

629
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.590
Oh, good!

630
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.620
You know, we got some of those!

631
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.030
Where'd you get...

632
00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.670
Where'd you get yours?!

633
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.570
Yeah... I'm not really sure!

634
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.770
My wife would know!

635
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.210
-Okay! Thanks for stopping by!
-Why the...

636
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.640
You don't live here.

637
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.110
Sorry. Trying to help.

638
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.880
Sure thing!

639
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.150
Hey. I wanted
to invite you to our...

640
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.290
new family live show!

641
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.890
Friday! At 00 p.m.!

642
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.260
Thumbs u... thumbs up.

643
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.900
Should I do it?

644
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.570
Yeah, do it.

645
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.230
Thumbs up!

646
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.300
- And so,
the router's in the shed.

647
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.300
I set it up so if the power
goes down on camera A,

648
00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.810
camera B's pointed
at the sky to catch

649
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.480
whatever might have
taken it out.

650
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.850
And,  vice versa, so...

651
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.850
Thank you.

652
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.420
I mean, you're really
not gonna tell me

653
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.680
what the fuck is going on?

654
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.860
- You'll know soon enough.
- Oh.

655
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.920
Cool, cryptic.

656
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:23.990
Fucking dicks.

657
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.490
I can monitor the feeds
remotely myself, if you want.

658
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.500
Free of charge.

659
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.440
- Hell no.
- No.

660
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.370
thank you, ma'am.

661
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.100
One more thing.

662
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.110
You'll be getting a call
from my supervisor

663
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.280
asking how my service was.

664
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.010
Five stars, Angel. Five stars.

665
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.340
Thank you.

666
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.860
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

667
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.820
- What you want to do?
- I'm - Whatever you want to do.

668
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.460
Well, I got some work
I got to do.

669
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.360
- I'm gonna go out...

670
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.860
That's a good one.

671
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.990
OPRAH I'm talking
today to women who say

672
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.650
they have been abducted
by aliens from another planet.

673
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.860
May I briefly
say, I don't know for a fact

674
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.150
that they're from
another planet.

675
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.530
Well, you know you weren't

676
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.570
- in Kansas anymore, Toto.

677
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.230
And I wasn't wearing red shoes

678
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.200
- that I could click together,
either. -Yeah, yeah.

679
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.300
Nope. Nope, I'm out.

680
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.160
I'm going. Fuck this shit.

681
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.910
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck off.

682
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:33.780
Give us back our property.

683
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.940
- Don't mess with
Jupiter's Claim! - Come on.

684
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:41.880
What happened?

685
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.450
The Park kids.

686
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.050
Jupe's sons.

687
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.730
And they let Clover out, man.

688
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.020
What?
They trying to prank Haywood?

689
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.620
- It's on!
- Hey. You stole their horse.

690
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.430
What's up, Nessie?

691
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.130
Not much. Just stocking shit.

692
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.070
You know, pretty much regular.

693
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.640
I need to take my ass to bed.

694
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:25.950
- Who this?
- Yo, it's Angel from Fry's.

695
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.560
Just calling to tell you that
there is a bug on camera A.

696
00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.160
I know. Wait, I thought I
told you not to watch our shit.

697
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.330
Yeah, I know, I know.

698
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:33.830
Camera B is down.

699
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.470
What?

700
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.460
Camera B is down.

701
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.170
Like<i> Ancient-fucking-Aliens</i>
down.

702
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.540
Emerald, can you please get
the bug off the thing?

703
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.890
Get the bug off
the fucking thing!

704
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.080
Shit.

705
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.730
What do you see?

706
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.770
Do you... do you see, like,
lights or anything?

707
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.170
Like, a-a fucking saucer?

708
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.140
It's in the cloud.
It's in the cloud.

709
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:26.610
OJ! It's in the cloud!

710
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.320
Run, OJ! Run!

711
00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.970
- Shit.

712
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.770
Hello?

713
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.440
What happened to OJ?

714
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.550
It's fine.

715
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.150
Come on.

716
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.150
Okay, it's still on.

717
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.290
The camera, it's still on.

718
00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.510
Okay, you fucking
praying mantis.

719
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:08.910
All right, bitch.

720
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.610
You like Sour Patch Kids?

721
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.700
A'ight, man.

722
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.600
Where your shit? Let's go.

723
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:40.200
Haven't seen one of those
in a minute.

724
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.930
Fucking praying mantis.

725
00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:43.470
That motherfucker better pray
I don't ever see him,

726
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.640
'cause if I do, I'm a eat him.

727
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.370
- Let's go.
- Where?

728
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.040
Man, I don't know.

729
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.780
I got me
a little situation in Atwater

730
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.450
texting me back right now.

731
00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.360
- It's not coming again tonight.
- I don't care.

732
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.820
No.

733
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:05.030
Bro, I ain't never seen
no shit like this.

734
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.490
It ain't worth it.

735
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.830
No, nope. It's too much.

736
00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.460
You should go, then.

737
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.700
I got to get up early anyway.

738
00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.110
I got mouths to feed.

739
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.180
You hear that?

740
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.750
Ghost out there.

741
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.430
Acting all territorial.

742
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.600
I guess some animals
ain't fit to be trained.

743
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.780
- Hello?
- Hi.

744
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.090
Is this, Antlers Holst?

745
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:46.930
Who's this?

746
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.900
Hey, yeah. I'm Emerald Haywood.

747
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:51.800
We met a couple days ago
at the commercial.

748
00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.400
- Oh, yeah, horse girl. Sure.

749
00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.570
I remember you and your brother.

750
00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.570
Yeah, horse boy.

751
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.280
He's here, too.

752
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.270
- The descendants of the jockey.

753
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:06.780
- Guess I'm talking to
motion picture royalty, then.

754
00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.910
How'd you get the number?

755
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.260
- I got it from the call sheet.

756
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:14.630
So, we have a project, and,

757
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.820
you know, what if I told you
it was the offer of a lifetime?

758
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.830
- Yeah,
hopefully not my lifetime.

759
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.360
That's a good one.
I'm a be real with you.

760
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:25.830
We don't have a lot of money
to pay you up front

761
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:28.610
you know, not like
you're used to- but...

762
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.170
Yeah. I tend to do one for them
so I can do one for me,

763
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.280
so what is it?

764
00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:38.050
- Reality.
- Oh, no. Reality.

765
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.780
Documentary.

766
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.690
- Doc-Documentary.
- that's better.

767
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.490
- So, again, what's it about?

768
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.260
It's about the shit
dreams is made of, baby.

769
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.300
Listen, horse girl.

770
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:56.290
- I got a...

771
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:59.700
...pretty damn superb
lemon tart in the oven

772
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.730
I'm about to serve to ten
of my closest friends, so...

773
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.370
Stop.

774
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.870
- Oh, hold on one second. What?

775
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.410
- He's not here for that.
- Look, look, no.

776
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:10.080
- Don't be cute.
Stick to the plan. Say it!

777
00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:11.810
- This is what I do.
- I don't go to your job

778
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:13.420
and knock a horse's dick
out your damn hand.

779
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.720
- Hello?
- Yeah.

780
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:16.310
Yeah, my bad. We good, man.

781
00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:20.530
According to
<i>American Cinema</i> magazine,

782
00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:24.990
you make the cinematically
impossible possible.

783
00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.330
Well, we looking
for the impossible shot.

784
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:34.200
That's impossible.

785
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.900
Antlers.

786
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.440
There's something out here
in Agua Dulce,

787
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.570
and you're probably
the only person in the world

788
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.010
that can get it on film.

789
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:44.910
Th-That's it.

790
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:50.790
Horse girl,
this dream you're chasing,

791
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.590
the one where you end up
at the top of the mountain,

792
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.220
all eyes on you...

793
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.570
...it's the dream
you never wake up from.

794
00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:17.880
I don't like him.

795
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:43.970
Holy shit. It's real.

796
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.280
- I don't know
what you're doing here, but...

797
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.920
it was illegal for you to...

798
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:52.810
spy on us like that.

799
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.990
Wait, you... you don't know?

800
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.630
Okay,  tell me
when you see it.

801
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.070
There.

802
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.910
- Doesn't move.
- Exactly.

803
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.140
Well, look at that.

804
00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.490
I went back and scrubbed
through the footage,

805
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:34.520
and that cloud
has been right there

806
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.190
at least since
I set the cameras up.

807
00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.830
Yeah, now you mention it,

808
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.960
I've probably been looking
at the same damn cloud

809
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.000
every day
for the last six months.

810
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:46.200
So, I mean,
that's them in there.

811
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.470
And we've been recording it,
so we got it.

812
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.170
Right?

813
00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.520
Why you saying "yeah" like that?

814
00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.910
I mean, we have proof
of aliens on video. I...

815
00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.810
Yeah, I wouldn't call it proof.

816
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.580
Are you serious?

817
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:04.490
Look, I've seen crazy weather
phenomenons online before.

818
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:07.150
- That's all I'm saying.
- He's right.

819
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.990
It's good, but it ain't it.
Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

820
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.320
Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

821
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:19.540
Okay. Are you guys telling me

822
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.840
that there's an alien spaceship

823
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:24.900
in that fucking cloud
right there?

824
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.300
It doesn't move like a ship.

825
00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.680
What you mean, OJ?

826
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.690
What if it's not a ship?

827
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.190
- <i>All right, Gordy,</i>
<i>we're almost ready, buddy.</i>

828
00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.590
- Here we go, buddy. Come on.

829
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:46.590
- He's ready.
- Set.

830
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:48.430
Here we go.

831
00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.930
And... action.

832
00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:51.700
And, of course,
I set it to Icelandic time

833
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.770
because we share a love
of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

834
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:58.640
And you have no idea
how to tell time.

835
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.810
- Great gift, Dad.

836
00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.550
Way to think things through.

837
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.370
Somehow, you'd think
that a man who can send

838
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.780
a rocket into space
would be able to manage

839
00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.820
a halfway decent
birthday present.

840
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.320
Nope.

841
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.790
You know, Gordy,
all things considered,

842
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:18.120
maybe my gift
isn't so bad after all.

843
00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.990
- Hey, Gordy.

844
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.970
- Surprise!

845
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.970
-  Now, that is a gift.

846
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:36.440
Oh. Sorry. My...

847
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.680
- That's all right.
Pick it up from there.

848
00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:40.450
Wait a minute.

849
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.420
What happened to we both failed
at finding good presents?

850
00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.130
Here you go, Gordy.
Happy birthday.

851
00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:54.160
- Oh, beautiful, Hayley.

852
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:04.780
<i>- No, no! Down! Down! Gordy!</i>
<i>- Down!</i>

853
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:06.640
<i>- No. Stop!</i>
<i>- Stop that!</i>

854
01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.880
-D-D-Down! Down! Down!

855
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.540
-You sit! Down.

856
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.610
- Seven just on scene
- Oh, my God.

857
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.930
Feeling good?

858
01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.900
Feeling good.

859
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:01.700
Good.

860
01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.610
There we go.

861
01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.650
Run it.
Run it one more time, babe.

862
01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.900
What if I told you...

863
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:40.570
Yo. It's, uh... Storm's coming.

864
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:44.180
Just tarping up,
just to be safe.

865
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:05.230
Hey, where you going?

866
01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.530
I'm a get Lucky.

867
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.500
<i>Now, we're not gonna let</i>

868
01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.330
a few clouds kill our fun
today, are we, folks?

869
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:14.480
So, without further ado,

870
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:18.410
welcome to the Jupiter's Claim
Star Lasso Experience!

871
01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.590
How's everyone feeling today?

872
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:26.510
All right.

873
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.520
It's quite a doozy today.

874
01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.200
I want to thank you guys
for coming out here.

875
01:05:32.330 --> 01:05:34.660
But first, how about
another round of applause

876
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.560
for my Amber?

877
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.430
- I'll tell you, that woman is

878
01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:41.660
a saint for putting up
with all my craziness.

879
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.600
And to the knuckleheads
up there.

880
01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.580
- The staff. Shout-out.

881
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.740
All right, all right.

882
01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.510
That's enough.

883
01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.910
I also want to give
a special thanks to

884
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.250
an old costar of mine
and my first crush,

885
01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.180
Mary Jo Elliott, everyone!

886
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.100
All right.

887
01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.530
- You ready?

888
01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:09.790
Oh, come on.
That ain't nothing.

889
01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:11.870
- Are you ready?!

890
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.110
Here we go.

891
01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.250
You're chosen.

892
01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.090
What if I told you...

893
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:41.100
that in about an hour...

894
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:44.200
you'll leave here different?

895
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:50.470
See, every Friday
for the last six months,

896
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.070
my family and I
have bore witness

897
01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:57.680
to an absolute spectacle.

898
01:06:57.810 --> 01:07:01.280
One that you'll be
seeing here today.

899
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:05.620
So let me take you back
to that first night.

900
01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:18.440
Right here in this exact spot,

901
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:22.640
I'd come over to wrangle
a chestnut horse named Trigger.

902
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:26.170
Now, I could barely see my hand
in front of my face

903
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.770
for the fog, but I swear

904
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:33.280
on my wife and children's lives

905
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:36.450
that at- 13 p.m.,

906
01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.260
I see...

907
01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.830
...a flying saucer

908
01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.660
descend through the mist.

909
01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:48.530
Old Trigger took off
straight into the gulch.

910
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:49.930
And, well...

911
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.360
...it's like he was going home.

912
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:03.370
Now, just to be clear,
what we saw

913
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:05.680
was a flying saucer.

914
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.050
No doubt about that.

915
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:08.550
Slightly flatter in the front,

916
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.250
with a circular hole
in the bottom

917
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:13.190
about two school bus
lengths wide.

918
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.990
Ladies and gentlemen,
I kid you not.

919
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:20.090
We are being surveilled

920
01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.670
by an alien species
I call "the Viewers."

921
01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.400
And though they have yet
to emerge from their ship,

922
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:30.340
I believe they trust me.

923
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.740
If they didn't,
I don't think any of us

924
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.170
would be here right now.

925
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.080
So, as I said,
in just under an hour,

926
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:46.020
Star Lasso Experience
is gonna change you.

927
01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:49.690
But first,
my boys are gonna come out

928
01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:52.090
and do a little number for us.
Would that be all right?

929
01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:53.960
- Hustle. Go, go, go.

930
01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:55.530
- All right.
My little satellites:

931
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:57.400
- Colton, Phoenix, Max.

932
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:59.030
Remember those names, folks.

933
01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:00.600
All right, here we go!

934
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:12.640
What is that?

935
01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.650
Do you guys see that?

936
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.640
stay in your seats.

937
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:33.600
This is new.

938
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.900
- they're early.

939
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:38.170
They're giving us
a real show today.

940
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.640
- That they are.
- Yeah.

941
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:41.280
They're giving us
a real show today.

942
01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.450
They're ready, we're ready.

943
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.420
Welcome to the Star Lasso Experience,

944
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:51.080
- only at Jupiter's Claim.

945
01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.120
- Please remember to avoid...
- Come on.

946
01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:54.850
...using your cell phones
or any flash photography...

947
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:57.190
- Cell phones off, y'all.
...during the event.

948
01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:58.620
Come on!

949
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.090
Bear with us now.

950
01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.290
Trained animals
can be unpredictable.

951
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:12.540
- Now sit back,
stay in your seats and enjoy

952
01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.470
the Star Lasso Experien...

953
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.600
Well, cowboys and cowgirls,

954
01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.110
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

955
01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.730
That's right. Happy trails.

956
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:54.610
It's closing time.

957
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.410
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

958
01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.140
Come back again.

959
01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.220
And until then,
we wish you well.

960
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:05.210
Hasta la vista. Adios.

961
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:24.270
Well, cowboys and cowgirls,

962
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.510
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

963
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.180
That's right. Happy trails.

964
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.110
It's closing time.

965
01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.980
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

966
01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.510
Come back again.

967
01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:36.980
And until then...

968
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:38.870
Lucky.

969
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.160
Lucky.

970
01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.090
Lucky, come on, come on.
Come on!

971
01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:16.120
Lucky.

972
01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.440
It's done.

973
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.450
All right, I'll be over in the
morning to tear that shit off.

974
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:20.650
Or you guys can do it
yourselves.

975
01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.250
- It's all the same.

976
01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.620
- I like when you do it.
- Of course you do.

977
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.790
All right. See you tomorrow.

978
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.620
- See you.

979
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.420
- Pick up, pick up, pick up,

980
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.640
Come on, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

981
01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.380
Did you know that

982
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:58.020
the very first assembly
of photographs

983
01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:00.120
in sequential order
to make a motion picture

984
01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.320
was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?

985
01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.490
- That man was a Bahamian jockey

986
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:06.390
known as Alistair E. Haywood,

987
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.530
and he was
my great-great-grandfather.

988
01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:09.890
- OJ Em.

989
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:11.460
I was right.

990
01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.200
It's not a ship.

991
01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.710
What happened?

992
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.780
What the fuck?

993
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.170
It ate them, Em.

994
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.730
It ate them all.

995
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:47.440
It's alive, Em. It's an animal.

996
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.230
It's territorial, and it thinks

997
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:53.370
that this is its home.

998
01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.010
- Em!

999
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:11.620
Hey, hey. We're in trouble.

1000
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.300
Oh, fuck.

1001
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:25.310
What?

1002
01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.730
What the fuck?

1003
01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:51.960
What the fuck?

1004
01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:56.370
Who the hell is that?

1005
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:59.140
Who the hell is that?

1006
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:03.140
- Em! Who the hell is that?
- Fuck.

1007
01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.790
It's above us.

1008
01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:15.730
Ah, shit!

1009
01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:20.760
Shit.

1010
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.430
- Oh, shit! What the fuck?

1011
01:18:43.150 --> 01:18:45.660
Oh, God.

1012
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:48.090
S-Something very bad
is happening.

1013
01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:01.330
Fuck!

1014
01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.750
Yeah, we're fucked.

1015
01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.290
Nope.

1016
01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:41.340
Em. OJ's coming.

1017
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.810
Let's go.

1018
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:44.610
Got to get out this house.

1019
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:46.620
I got to get out this house.

1020
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:48.460
No, st-st-stop.
Can't we just wait, right?

1021
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:50.290
- You can. -No, I'm not
gonna be here alone.

1022
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.130
- I've got to get out
this fucking house! -No.

1023
01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.590
We're alive still
because we stayed here.

1024
01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.420
Yeah, she... she gonna make it.

1025
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.050
- OJ.
- She gonna make it.

1026
01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:31.690
- Oh, hey, horsie.
- Hey, don't - don't look him

1027
01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:34.220
- in the eyes, please.
- VFX!

1028
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:50.050
Focus here. Focus here.

1029
01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.750
- Come on.

1030
01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:18.430
Welcome to my tavern.

1031
01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:21.800
I don't know if you've heard,
but a terrible beast is about.

1032
01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.640
It's been harassing villagers,

1033
01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:26.310
ruining crops
and eating their livestock.

1034
01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:35.030
Many a glory-seeking hunter
has attempted to defeat it,

1035
01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.950
and just as many have perished.

1036
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:40.460
While you're here...

1037
01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.800
While you're here,
please look around.

1038
01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:48.670
I'm here in
Agua Dulce, California,

1039
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.270
and the whereabouts of
those 40 guests and employees

1040
01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.940
of a local Western theme park
are still unknown.

1041
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:56.510
The sheriff's office
has had its hands full

1042
01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:58.710
trying to identify
the unaccounted for.

1043
01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:01.280
Until they do,
only one thing is certain.

1044
01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:02.850
There is something strange
happening

1045
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:04.550
out here in Agua Dulce.

1046
01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:06.480
cameras were off at the time.

1047
01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.490
Other than that, we have,
no reason to suspect foul play.

1048
01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:10.890
We did have
a considerable amount

1049
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:12.400
of rain come through here,

1050
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:15.290
so we don't want to rule out
flash flooding

1051
01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:18.030
as possibly having played
a part. We're obviously...

1052
01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:24.810
- You never go wrong
with a fried fish sandwich.

1053
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:29.970
Tartar got tang.

1054
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:33.480
Stupid.

1055
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:35.090
"Tartar got tang"?

1056
01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.540
Right?

1057
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.150
I don't think it eats you if
you don't look it in the eye.

1058
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:48.490
-RTR, bro.

1059
01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.330
You know?

1060
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.800
Like, read the room.

1061
01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.970
Nobody want to talk about that.

1062
01:28:01.210 --> 01:28:03.210
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

1063
01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:04.910
All right, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

1064
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.350
- Hey, you lucky!

1065
01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.250
<i>Every animal got rules.</i>

1066
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:11.090
All right?
We know what it wants,

1067
01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.890
and we know how it comes, so...

1068
01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:14.720
Fuck.

1069
01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.020
We don't really know shit.

1070
01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.920
OJ, what's this about, man?

1071
01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.560
What's this about?
You want me to...

1072
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.230
You want me to say, "I'm sorry"?

1073
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:26.870
"I was wrong"? "It's dumb"?

1074
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.370
It wasn't dumb.

1075
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.970
- Own the moment.
- Stop.

1076
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:31.970
- Stop, stop this shit.
- It was good. It was good.

1077
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.940
But the moment about to pass.

1078
01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.740
And we don't own shit.

1079
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:43.480
Okay. Well, I assume
y'all are crashing at mine.

1080
01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:45.480
Right, 'cause you can.

1081
01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.120
'Cause I'm not going back

1082
01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.590
to the fucking monster umbrella.

1083
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:52.260
- Got to feed 'em.

1084
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:54.370
Let Lucky out.

1085
01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.460
There's shit to do.

1086
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:59.190
Always.

1087
01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:02.200
Always some shit to do.

1088
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:52.480
- There's a wheelchair
on your roof.

1089
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.180
Hi.

1090
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.820
- That cloud ain't moved
a goddamn inch.

1091
01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.500
So you're not completely
full of shit.

1092
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:02.530
Thank you.

1093
01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:04.360
Yeah. Thank you.

1094
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.140
Th-The concept
of extraterrestrial animals

1095
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:09.060
in the sky is not a new thing.

1096
01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.840
You know, people been trying

1097
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.640
to get pictures of these things
since, like, the '50s.

1098
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.340
- You know, it's an ancient...
- How do we see it?

1099
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.540
- It's gonna get hungry again.

1100
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:21.220
So, you know...

1101
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:23.210
just ring the dinner bell.

1102
01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.250
- Now, we know
what it doesn't like.

1103
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:34.390
That little fake horse
and flags messed it up good.

1104
01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.200
Got stuck in its windpipe
or something.

1105
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.240
I bet it ain't gonna fuck with
flags like that in a minute.

1106
01:30:44.210 --> 01:30:45.740
We pissed him off.

1107
01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.540
- We're not the reason
it settled down here.

1108
01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:50.270
That was Jupe.

1109
01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:52.440
He got caught up
trying to tame a predator.

1110
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.910
You can't do that.

1111
01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:55.780
You got to enter an agreement
with one.

1112
01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.150
Ask Siegfried and Roy.

1113
01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.450
Asking as someone
who was in the house

1114
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:09.420
- when the shit went down...

1115
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.560
How exactly do you enter
an agreement with a fucking...

1116
01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:16.760
a UFO, alien entity or whatever
the hell you want to call it?

1117
01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:18.770
Jean Jacket.

1118
01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.540
Call him Jean Jacket.

1119
01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.140
So, how about this?

1120
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:24.780
How about we send
ol' Jean Jacket

1121
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:26.650
some fresh horses in golden hour

1122
01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.750
- and see what happens?

1123
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.490
Horse people.

1124
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.420
Why not just set them free?

1125
01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:34.890
We're not doing that.

1126
01:31:37.630 --> 01:31:41.290
Who is gonna go down there

1127
01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:44.100
and get the star
out of his trailer?

1128
01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:48.300
Me.

1129
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.740
I'll get him out.

1130
01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.000
Where you want it?

1131
01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:57.610
You draw him out there.

1132
01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.780
I'm here.

1133
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:02.750
On this ridge.

1134
01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.590
Oh, shit.

1135
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:07.850
Made her myself.

1136
01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:10.160
No electricity.

1137
01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:12.160
Didn't I tell you
this motherfucker was gonna

1138
01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:14.490
come up here with
a non-electrical camera?

1139
01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:16.590
Let's go, boy!

1140
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:21.270
- I've been up under it
a couple times now.

1141
01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.330
I get him.

1142
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.170
<i>It's an animal.</i>

1143
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:27.870
<i>You don't turn your back</i>
<i>on a bear.</i>

1144
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:29.440
<i>You don't wear red</i>
<i>around a bull.</i>

1145
01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.280
<i>It's like that.</i>

1146
01:32:31.410 --> 01:32:34.920
<i>You don't look at it</i>
<i>unless you want its attention.</i>

1147
01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:38.850
Good night, Mr. Storeman.

1148
01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.320
Fuck it. I call top hat.

1149
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:43.790
<i>And we ain't got a lot of time.</i>

1150
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:47.120
<i>One day. Two days, tops.</i>

1151
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:53.870
<i>'Cause the word is getting out,</i>
<i>and when it does...</i>

1152
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.900
- Sorry, dead people.
Park's closed.

1153
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.470
<i>...you know people gonna come</i>

1154
01:32:58.610 --> 01:33:01.010
<i>and do what they always do:</i>

1155
01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.570
<i>try and take it all</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

1156
01:33:03.710 --> 01:33:05.310
Fine.

1157
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:06.910
Thimble.

1158
01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:09.510
That's the one I wanted anyway.

1159
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:13.980
<i>Well, let 'em come.</i>

1160
01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.850
<i>It ain't gonna matter.</i>

1161
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:20.800
<i>'Cause what we about to do...</i>

1162
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:25.330
<i>...they can't erase that.</i>

1163
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:35.070
He's big, he's bad,

1164
01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:37.140
and he's got a lot of spirit.

1165
01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:43.210
But anything with a spirit
can get broke.

1166
01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.890
So you break it.

1167
01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:51.190
I'll get the shot.

1168
01:34:00.170 --> 01:34:01.760
What we're doing's important.

1169
01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.400
Right?

1170
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:06.880
Like, what we document,
it's...

1171
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:11.410
...it's gonna do some good?

1172
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:17.110
I mean, besides the money
and fucking fame,

1173
01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:18.590
like, we can save some lives.

1174
01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.720
Fuck, we-we can even save Earth.

1175
01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:23.290
Right?

1176
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:28.460
<i>Sure looks strange to me.</i>

1177
01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.970
He ain't gonna fuck with you.

1178
01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.210
Time to wake up the family.

1179
01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.970
Here we go.

1180
01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:49.940
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1181
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:20.670
How exquisitely stupid is that?

1182
01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.210
We gonna get you today,
motherfucker.

1183
01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.290
Where is the feed
for Holst's camera?

1184
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:24.800
Over.

1185
01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.500
Couldn't figure it out. Over.

1186
01:38:26.630 --> 01:38:28.500
- What you mean,
you couldn't figure it out?

1187
01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:30.210
Over.

1188
01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:33.700
- Holst is shooting
on a film camera,

1189
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.350
and all of our cameras are
digital, so it's a whole thing.

1190
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.910
Over.

1191
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.020
- Basically,
you forgot about it. Over.

1192
01:38:41.150 --> 01:38:42.880
Yeah, well, I had my hands full

1193
01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:44.920
rigging 50 fucking sky dancers
to dead people's car batteries

1194
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.150
all connected
to one control panel.

1195
01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:48.150
So, yeah, fucking over. Sorry.

1196
01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.330
I'm scared.

1197
01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.250
Man down.

1198
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:53.390
Man down? What? Where?

1199
01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:56.160
Last dancer, deep in the gulch.

1200
01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.830
Stay on it, Em. I'm staying up.

1201
01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.970
Motherfucker.

1202
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:13.520
Oh, wait, wait.

1203
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.280
Oh, it's back up.

1204
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:17.420
Could be a faulty battery.

1205
01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:21.520
All right. Shot's up, then.

1206
01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:25.720
Nah, he's poking.

1207
01:39:35.230 --> 01:39:37.100
Who's this asshole?

1208
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:40.940
- Man in black
on a white motorcycle.

1209
01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.840
No, no, no, no, no, no. Shit.

1210
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:49.450
Can I help you?

1211
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.890
You see that cloud?

1212
01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.630
Hey, man, who you with?

1213
01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:06.230
Oh, I'm sorry.

1214
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.730
Who are you?

1215
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:09.900
Nobody.

1216
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:12.900
- You don't look like
a nobody to me.

1217
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:14.810
Yeah, look, w-we doing
a camera test

1218
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:16.280
for a Verizon commercial,

1219
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.010
so now I'm-a need you
to clear the road.

1220
01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:20.010
- This whole valley
comes up as blurry

1221
01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:21.910
on Google Maps.

1222
01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.250
You're really tucked away
back here.

1223
01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:26.910
Jupiter's Claim?

1224
01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.760
Quicker if you go
the other way around.

1225
01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.020
Actually,

1226
01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.430
what did happen with Jupe Park
and all those people?

1227
01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:39.260
He was basically
your neighbor, right?

1228
01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.860
So, what, they vanished?

1229
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.170
You don't believe
the flood narrative, do you?

1230
01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.640
Fuck, guys.

1231
01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:46.240
It's<i> TMZ.</i>

1232
01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.440
Oh, fuck me.

1233
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:53.970
hey, guys.  Jean Jacket
is definitely in those clouds,

1234
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:56.850
and he's definitely
coming this way.

1235
01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.220
- What's the matter?
Don't you want to be on TV?

1236
01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.010
Man, I'm trying to tell you.

1237
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:03.550
You don't want to go that way.

1238
01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.350
Fuck it.

1239
01:41:05.490 --> 01:41:07.660
Your loss, nobody.

1240
01:41:17.670 --> 01:41:19.740
We still rolling? Over.

1241
01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:22.000
Goddamn right we are.

1242
01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:30.820
Fellas, here it comes. Over.

1243
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:32.550
Pop quiz, guys.

1244
01:41:32.690 --> 01:41:35.080
What happens
when an electric bike

1245
01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:38.260
going 60 miles per hour
hits an anti-electric field

1246
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:40.300
going in the opposite direction?

1247
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.730
- Shit.
We're all gonna go to jail.

1248
01:41:58.350 --> 01:42:01.510
Oh, fuck. There's no way
that that guy's alive.

1249
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:09.920
Goddamn.

1250
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:11.590
I told his ass not to go.

1251
01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.890
- I told him not to go.

1252
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.930
hey, OJ, what's...

1253
01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.360
Wh-Where the fuck
are you going?

1254
01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500
The fuck is he doing?

1255
01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:26.900
I'm going dark. Over.

1256
01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:32.740
No self-respecting...

1257
01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:56.070
Did you get that on camera?

1258
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.800
- Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. - What happened?

1259
01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:00.570
- Listen, listen, we-we
got to get you out of here.

1260
01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:03.480
- Eyes on me.
- Where's my camera?

1261
01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:05.470
- I need my camera.

1262
01:43:05.610 --> 01:43:07.480
Do you see it?

1263
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:13.580
Okay. Angel?

1264
01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.250
- What?
- Angel, come on.

1265
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:17.530
We got to reload.

1266
01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.810
Wait.

1267
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:32.970
where's your phone?

1268
01:43:33.110 --> 01:43:35.980
- Why aren't you filming this?

1269
01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:37.840
What?

1270
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:40.140
Angel, what's happening?

1271
01:43:44.690 --> 01:43:47.650
Okay, OJ, if you die
trying to save that guy,

1272
01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:49.880
I'll kill you.

1273
01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:52.060
No. No, no, please.

1274
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.890
- Please, no. No. -We're gonna
get you out. Shut your eye.

1275
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:55.990
- Shut your eye.
- Not before you take a picture.

1276
01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.960
T-Take a picture first!

1277
01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:01.400
camera reloads.

1278
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.140
You can use my camera.

1279
01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.140
- No, no.
There's not enough time.

1280
01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.480
It's here.

1281
01:44:16.810 --> 01:44:18.680
Be Scorpion King.

1282
01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:20.420
Make a name for yourself.

1283
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:23.650
What is that?

1284
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:26.860
- My bad, man.

1285
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:29.160
- Oh, my God.

1286
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:31.430
My camera! I need my camera!

1287
01:44:31.570 --> 01:44:33.530
- Oh, my God! Fuck!

1288
01:44:38.970 --> 01:44:40.230
- Give me the lid.
Give me the lid.

1289
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:42.740
- Come on. All right.

1290
01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:50.780
Hey, hey! Is everybody okay?

1291
01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.790
For the love of fuck,
talk to me, please!

1292
01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.790
OJ.

1293
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:07.260
OJ. OJ!

1294
01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.700
You stupid-ass motherfucker,
you better answer me.

1295
01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:13.900
Are you okay?!

1296
01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.040
Are you good? Over.

1297
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:57.580
- Holy shit, I-I think
it's taking the dancers.

1298
01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:59.650
Are you getting this?

1299
01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:09.830
Guys, OJ's hooded up.

1300
01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.100
He's doing the run.
OJ's doing the run!

1301
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:15.800
Hey, it's gone.

1302
01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:17.470
I can't see it anymore, guys.

1303
01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.140
Get it. Get it!

1304
01:47:32.150 --> 01:47:34.410
-Lucky, go. Go, go, go, go, go!

1305
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:50.400
Holy shit!

1306
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:55.030
Let's go!

1307
01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:57.130
Yeah, he didn't like that,
did he?

1308
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:59.300
- OJ,
you're a motherfucking genius.

1309
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:01.700
We got it. We got it.

1310
01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.100
It's over.

1311
01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.650
It's over. We got it, y'all!

1312
01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:06.740
The feed started going
in and out when...

1313
01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.310
when that guy got got.

1314
01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.710
But we should be covered
with the film camera.

1315
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:12.560
Right, Holst?

1316
01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.230
The light.

1317
01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.130
The light, it's...

1318
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:32.300
...gonna be magic soon.

1319
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:39.780
What you mean, Ant?

1320
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:47.590
Wh-Where you going?

1321
01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:52.320
It's gonna be all right, Angel.

1322
01:48:53.290 --> 01:48:55.460
We don't deserve the impossible.

1323
01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.170
hey, guys.

1324
01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:07.170
Holst just said
some creepy, cryptic shit.

1325
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:09.440
Took his camera.
He's heading up the mountain.

1326
01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:11.240
Over.

1327
01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.950
Hey, Holst.

1328
01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.040
Holst. Wait. Hold on, man.

1329
01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:19.050
Talk to me. What happened?

1330
01:49:19.190 --> 01:49:21.120
Did you get the shot
or didn't you? Over.

1331
01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.690
This nigga.

1332
01:49:26.690 --> 01:49:28.660
Fuck.

1333
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:30.790
This is crazy, right?

1334
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:49.050
Come on, come on, come on.

1335
01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.110
No, man.

1336
01:50:20.250 --> 01:50:21.680
The fuck?

1337
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.520
Holst.

1338
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:56.650
Oh, shit.

1339
01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.160
What?

1340
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:17.460
-Oh, no!

1341
01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:33.510
Don't look. Don't look.

1342
01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.030
Get the bike!

1343
01:52:58.170 --> 01:52:59.740
Get out of here!

1344
01:53:11.150 --> 01:53:12.920
Oh, my God.

1345
01:53:13.050 --> 01:53:15.350
You're dead! Dead!

1346
01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:21.460
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Look down.

1347
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:08.910
Come on.

1348
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:19.910
Just leave, OJ.

1349
01:55:20.050 --> 01:55:21.840
Forget it! Come on!

1350
01:55:23.490 --> 01:55:24.710
Come on!

1351
01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:41.980
It's gonna fuck you up.

1352
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:30.960
What the...

1353
01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:01.700
I'm gonna get you,
you motherfucker.

1354
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:22.610
I'm - a take you to Oprah.

1355
02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:24.880
Let's go to Oprah.

1356
02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:38.960
Nobody fucks
with Haywood, bitch!

1357
02:01:39.090 --> 02:01:40.720
Nobody!

1358
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:42.420
You hear me?!

1359
02:01:54.170 --> 02:01:57.100
Cowboys and cowgirls,

1360
02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:59.140
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

1361
02:01:59.270 --> 02:02:02.110
- That's right. Happy trails.

1362
02:02:02.250 --> 02:02:03.780
It's closing time.

1363
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:06.760
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

1364
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:08.320
Come back again.

1365
02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:11.490
Until then, we wish you well.

1366
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:15.220
- Hasta la vista. Adios.

1367
02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:17.460
- Yeah, get a shot of her.
Zoom in.

1368
02:02:29.070 --> 02:02:30.610
We're ready.

1369
02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:32.110
We're set up, ready to go.

1370
02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:38.310
Folks, this is Wally Pachenko

1371
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:40.290
- reporting live from Agua Dulce

1372
02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:42.580
just outside of Jupiter's Claim,

1373
02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:44.960
where just seconds ago

1374
02:02:45.090 --> 02:02:47.960
an inexplicable occurrence,
just in the distance...

1375
02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:50.630
You can probably hear
th-the shock in my voice.

1376
02:02:50.770 --> 02:02:53.530
There are still some fragments,
floating in the air

1377
02:02:53.670 --> 02:02:57.770
where some-some
unidentified object

1378
02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:00.100
just drifted off into space
and exploded.

1379
02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:02.710
you can see some fragments
still falling from the sky.

1380
02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:04.840
we will have some amazing...
