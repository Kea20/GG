01:17.388 --&gt; 01:19.390
My...my name
is Chloe Albright.

01:19.423 --&gt; 01:21.758
I am a second-year
medical student.

01:22.759 --&gt; 01:25.162
Yes, of course. Yeah.

01:26.163 --&gt; 01:27.564
No, I just... I, um...

01:27.598 --&gt; 01:30.133
I don't understand
this foreclosure notice.

01:32.002 --&gt; 01:35.472
Yeah, no, I spoke to
the regional manager, actually,

01:35.506 --&gt; 01:37.408
on...on March 25th

01:37.441 --&gt; 01:40.143
and then again on May 17th.

01:42.279 --&gt; 01:43.647
What?

01:44.648 --&gt; 01:47.251
No... No, no, no. I...

01:47.284 --&gt; 01:48.585
Yeah, no, I know that,

01:48.619 --&gt; 01:50.787
but my student loan
got suspended

01:50.821 --&gt; 01:54.425
and my dad's life insurance,
it never paid out.

01:57.160 --&gt; 01:58.662
Why?

02:00.431 --&gt; 02:02.366
Because suicide isn't covered.

02:05.202 --&gt; 02:07.771
Look, um...

02:07.804 --&gt; 02:12.175
This...this house is all that
my brother and I have left, OK?

02:13.777 --&gt; 02:15.078
No.

02:15.111 --&gt; 02:17.248
No, you...you cannot
take it from us, OK?

02:17.281 --&gt; 02:18.749
If you evict us from our home,

02:18.782 --&gt; 02:20.484
then we will have
nowhere else to go.

02:21.785 --&gt; 02:23.186
Hello?

02:25.055 --&gt; 02:26.690
Hello?

02:30.060 --&gt; 02:31.462
Damn you.

02:45.809 --&gt; 02:48.345
Come on, TJ. Don't ignore me.

02:52.349 --&gt; 02:54.184
Do you know '1984'
was supposed to be,

02:54.217 --&gt; 02:55.886
you know, like,
a cautionary tale

02:55.919 --&gt; 02:57.220
for us average Joes?

02:57.254 --&gt; 02:59.556
Not a...not a goddamn
instruction manual

02:59.590 --&gt; 03:01.224
for the rich...

03:01.258 --&gt; 03:03.494
..b-bitches that run the show.

03:03.527 --&gt; 03:05.496
You know, I mean,
they read the book and go,

03:05.529 --&gt; 03:07.331
"Hey, th-th-these
are some great ideas.

03:07.364 --&gt; 03:10.401
"Let's...let's do this."

03:10.434 --&gt; 03:11.668
Mind control for dummies.

03:11.702 --&gt; 03:14.305
I mean, c-c-can you

03:14.338 --&gt; 03:16.206
b-b-believe that shit?

03:16.239 --&gt; 03:18.375
And cell phones. Cell phones.

03:18.409 --&gt; 03:20.677
That's real b-big brother

03:20.711 --&gt; 03:23.914
except they don't need
to brainwash us to use them.

03:23.947 --&gt; 03:26.483
We pay for the privilege.

03:26.517 --&gt; 03:28.585
I mean, cops, politicians,

03:28.619 --&gt; 03:30.253
they don't protect and serve us.

03:30.287 --&gt; 03:33.524
They protect and serve
the hard-cash overlords from us.

03:33.557 --&gt; 03:36.059
They sell us the idea of freedom

03:36.092 --&gt; 03:38.261
while making sure
we never get it.

03:38.295 --&gt; 03:43.166
It's...it's all psychopaths
who say, "2 plus 2 equals 5,"

03:43.199 --&gt; 03:45.268
who say the best we're gonna get

03:45.302 --&gt; 03:48.339
is...is a boot in the face.

03:48.372 --&gt; 03:51.207
Bro! Could you just
shut the fuck up?

03:51.241 --&gt; 03:53.877
No, no, because if you ask me...

03:53.910 --&gt; 03:56.780
Shut... Hey, give me
the fuckin' book!

03:56.813 --&gt; 03:58.882
No more Book Club, Oprah.

03:58.915 --&gt; 04:01.818
-Alright? Goddamn!
-Fine, fine! OK!

04:05.221 --&gt; 04:06.723
Let's do this, man.

04:08.725 --&gt; 04:10.126
OK.

04:11.895 --&gt; 04:13.764
We got this.

04:13.797 --&gt; 04:15.399
-Alright.
-No, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:15.432 --&gt; 04:17.601
What are you doing, Book Club?

04:17.634 --&gt; 04:19.670
You're the driver.
You're stayin' here.

04:20.671 --&gt; 04:23.206
I... Yeah, no, I know. I, um...

04:23.239 --&gt; 04:25.642
You know, I hate to be
the one to tell you this.

04:25.676 --&gt; 04:26.977
I don't have a licence.

04:27.010 --&gt; 04:28.211
You don't have
a driver's licence?

04:28.244 --&gt; 04:29.312
-Yeah.
-Oh, holy fuck.

04:29.346 --&gt; 04:30.747
What are we gonna do about you

04:30.781 --&gt; 04:32.148
not having
a driver's licence right now?

04:32.182 --&gt; 04:33.450
I...I...I don't know.

04:33.484 --&gt; 04:34.951
-I don't know.

04:34.985 --&gt; 04:37.087
Dude, guess I'm just gonna
have to fuckin' kill you.

04:37.120 --&gt; 04:38.955
Whoa, whoa! OK, wait.
You said no-one was gonna...

04:38.989 --&gt; 04:40.457
-Fuck!

04:40.491 --&gt; 04:42.426
-Fuck you!

04:42.459 --&gt; 04:43.927
Fuck!

04:43.960 --&gt; 04:45.762
Dude, I could have poked
my fucking eye out!

04:45.796 --&gt; 04:47.964
What do you think, I got
a real gun or something?

04:47.998 --&gt; 04:50.000
No, I don't know, I don't know!

04:50.033 --&gt; 04:51.668
OK.

04:51.702 --&gt; 04:53.103
-Right pedal's gas.
-I know, I know.

04:53.136 --&gt; 04:54.738
Left pedal's...
Oh, you know so fucking much?

04:54.771 --&gt; 04:56.306
But you don't have
a driver's licence.

04:56.339 --&gt; 04:58.241
Yes, I know, I know. I just...

04:58.274 --&gt; 05:01.478
Look, I'm just... Look,
I'm still getting my cut, right?

05:01.512 --&gt; 05:04.214
TJ, I'm only doing this
so you get your fucking cut.

05:05.516 --&gt; 05:06.983
-You know that, right?
-Yes, I do.

05:07.017 --&gt; 05:08.452
That's the only reason I'm here.

05:08.485 --&gt; 05:09.920
I know.

05:09.953 --&gt; 05:11.622
Thanks.

05:11.655 --&gt; 05:14.691
Seriously, we...we, you know...

05:14.725 --&gt; 05:16.660
..be...we'd be dead
without you, so...

05:16.693 --&gt; 05:18.128
-I got you.
-Yeah.

05:18.161 --&gt; 05:20.363
You just...keep it runnin'.

05:20.397 --&gt; 05:21.798
I know.

05:22.999 --&gt; 05:25.769
-Just be careful, OK?
-Yeah.

05:25.802 --&gt; 05:27.538
-Alright?
-Alright.

05:28.539 --&gt; 05:30.173
Right pedal, gas.
Left pedal, brake.

05:30.206 --&gt; 05:31.708
Brake. Yeah, I know.

05:39.015 --&gt; 05:40.984
Less than a minute, alright?

05:41.017 --&gt; 05:42.986
Yeah, just hurry, OK?

05:58.769 --&gt; 06:00.236
Alright.

06:01.237 --&gt; 06:02.639
Alright.

06:02.673 --&gt; 06:04.575
Right pedal... Right.

06:16.419 --&gt; 06:17.854
-Oh! Shit!

06:17.888 --&gt; 06:20.223
-Let's go!

06:20.256 --&gt; 06:22.926
Start the car!

06:22.959 --&gt; 06:24.761
Hey, you punk!

06:26.129 --&gt; 06:27.531
-Go!

06:27.564 --&gt; 06:28.765
-Come on!
-Just start the car!

06:28.799 --&gt; 06:30.901
-Start the fucking car!
-Get out of here!

06:52.255 --&gt; 06:53.757
Hello?

06:57.160 --&gt; 06:59.195
Hello?

06:59.229 --&gt; 07:00.463
Chloe, it's me.

07:00.497 --&gt; 07:02.098
-Can you let me in?
-Oh.

07:03.233 --&gt; 07:06.136
TJ. Hi... Whoa.

07:11.474 --&gt; 07:13.544
-Fuck! Ow!
-Hold still, hold still.

07:13.577 --&gt; 07:15.546
-Shit, Chloe! God.
-Yeah, shit is right.

07:15.579 --&gt; 07:17.213
What the hell were you thinking?

07:17.247 --&gt; 07:20.684
No...no-one
was supposed to get hurt.

07:21.685 --&gt; 07:23.920
OK? Ross said that it...

07:23.954 --&gt; 07:27.758
Wait... Ross?

07:29.192 --&gt; 07:31.728
TJ, you...you pulled
this shit with Ross?

07:31.762 --&gt; 07:33.730
I couldn't do it alone.

07:33.764 --&gt; 07:37.467
I've told you to stay away
from him so many times.

07:37.500 --&gt; 07:40.837
You dated him for three years.
You know he's not a bad guy.

07:40.871 --&gt; 07:42.405
He's bad news, TJ.

07:44.307 --&gt; 07:46.142
-Fuck!
-It's out.

07:46.176 --&gt; 07:47.844
Chloe!

07:50.313 --&gt; 07:52.649
He's not a bad guy, OK?
He just...

07:54.851 --&gt; 07:56.086
Things got away from him.

07:56.119 --&gt; 07:57.621
Things didn't get away from him.

07:57.654 --&gt; 08:00.356
He pushed them away.
We can't be like him, TJ.

08:00.390 --&gt; 08:03.026
-You cannot be like him.
-He's dead.

08:05.696 --&gt; 08:07.731
I think. I don't...

08:09.365 --&gt; 08:10.901
I don't know.

08:19.175 --&gt; 08:20.744
It's not easy...

08:22.245 --&gt; 08:23.680
..for me, Chloe, OK?

08:23.714 --&gt; 08:25.481
You know, you handle all...

08:25.515 --&gt; 08:28.218
You think that this
is easy for me?

08:29.485 --&gt; 08:33.523
No. No, I did this for you, OK?

08:34.925 --&gt; 08:36.827
-What?
-OK, I...

08:37.861 --&gt; 08:41.798
I know you're having
trou-trouble with tuition.

08:41.832 --&gt; 08:43.533
And...

08:43.566 --&gt; 08:45.201
..now they're gonna
take the house.

08:45.235 --&gt; 08:47.137
And I...I just
wanted to help, OK?

08:47.170 --&gt; 08:48.739
I know how this is
gonna affect you.

08:48.772 --&gt; 08:50.006
I just...I just want to help.

08:50.040 --&gt; 08:53.009
I couldn't just st-stand by...

08:55.078 --&gt; 08:57.047
..and let you go
through this, you know?

08:58.448 --&gt; 08:59.950
No, I know.

09:02.185 --&gt; 09:04.921
I know, OK? I fucked up.

09:04.955 --&gt; 09:06.623
I fucked up.

09:11.361 --&gt; 09:13.296
Another one bites the dust.

09:16.232 --&gt; 09:20.103
Yeah, get the coroner
and his meat wagon here ASAP.

09:20.136 --&gt; 09:22.238
I don't want the locals
looking at this dead hoodlum

09:22.272 --&gt; 09:23.674
bleeding in the street.

09:25.475 --&gt; 09:27.077
You get a plate
on our wheel man?

09:27.110 --&gt; 09:28.544
-No plate, Sheriff.
-Description?

09:28.578 --&gt; 09:30.380
-Ski masks.
-Sheriff.

09:30.413 --&gt; 09:32.248
We've got a flaming car
out on Mission Road.

09:32.282 --&gt; 09:34.184
Sounds like a match
for your getaway vehicle.

09:34.217 --&gt; 09:35.786
Huh.

09:35.819 --&gt; 09:37.420
Well, ain't that a thing?

09:38.421 --&gt; 09:39.856
Looks like our wheel man's

09:39.890 --&gt; 09:41.591
the brains
of this cluster fuck.

09:41.624 --&gt; 09:43.860
OK, I'm going to
ask you some questions, yeah?

09:43.894 --&gt; 09:45.228
Mm-hmm.

09:45.261 --&gt; 09:47.063
-TJ?
-Yeah, yeah.

09:47.097 --&gt; 09:49.565
I need you to be
100% honest with me, OK?

09:53.336 --&gt; 09:55.071
OK, did anybody see you?

09:55.105 --&gt; 09:58.809
No. We...we wore
masks and gloves.

09:58.842 --&gt; 10:01.878
OK, good. Uh, did you tell
anybody about this?

10:01.912 --&gt; 10:03.980
No, no, I swear.

10:04.014 --&gt; 10:05.648
And the car? What about the car?

10:05.682 --&gt; 10:08.418
I ditched it.
I...I set it on fire.

10:09.419 --&gt; 10:11.387
Fire? That's smart.

10:11.421 --&gt; 10:13.456
OK, um... Whose car was it?

10:13.489 --&gt; 10:14.925
Stolen.

10:16.159 --&gt; 10:17.928
OK, then, you're fine.

10:19.529 --&gt; 10:20.931
You're gonna be fine.

10:20.964 --&gt; 10:22.833
You're gonna...
you're gonna stay here with me.

10:22.866 --&gt; 10:25.068
Right? You're gonna...
you're gonna keep a low profile.

10:25.101 --&gt; 10:28.238
They have absolutely no reason
to think that you would...

10:31.674 --&gt; 10:34.077
-What?

10:34.110 --&gt; 10:35.611
What?

10:37.013 --&gt; 10:38.581
Ross's phone.

10:38.614 --&gt; 10:40.316
What about Ross's cell phone?

10:40.350 --&gt; 10:43.353
I...I...
It's on...it's on him.

10:43.386 --&gt; 10:45.188
It's on him and I forgot.

10:45.221 --&gt; 10:46.857
I just...

10:46.890 --&gt; 10:49.092
It's...it's...

10:49.125 --&gt; 10:53.363
You planned a robbery

10:53.396 --&gt; 10:55.465
on a fucking iPhone?

10:57.400 --&gt; 11:00.270
-Are they gonna go easy on me?
-Are they gonna go easy on you?

11:00.303 --&gt; 11:02.505
TJ, it is an armed robbery
where somebody ends up dead.

11:02.538 --&gt; 11:05.008
TJ, that is 25 to life.

11:05.041 --&gt; 11:07.610
But, you know,
I...I was only the driver.

11:07.643 --&gt; 11:09.679
You were only the driver?
You think that matters to them?

11:09.712 --&gt; 11:11.114
That doesn't matter to them.

11:11.147 --&gt; 11:13.716
And you going to jail,
that breaks my promise to Mom.

11:13.750 --&gt; 11:15.318
What are we gonna do?

11:19.089 --&gt; 11:21.157
We have to get the phone.

11:22.325 --&gt; 11:23.827
How?

11:26.362 --&gt; 11:28.098
Just give me five minutes.

11:34.270 --&gt; 11:36.339
Out here,
regional budgets have been cut

11:36.372 --&gt; 11:38.474
and so the morgue
is pretty much a one-man shop.

11:38.508 --&gt; 11:40.811
And the sheriff's department,
it's overworked, understaffed.

11:40.844 --&gt; 11:42.645
The chief has been cracking down
on local meth-heads.

11:42.678 --&gt; 11:44.147
According to the news,
about an hour

11:44.180 --&gt; 11:45.515
before they
brought Ross's body in,

11:45.548 --&gt; 11:47.517
a girl was killed
when her car hit a tree.

11:47.550 --&gt; 11:50.420
So we know there are at least
2 bodies in there, 1 coroner.

11:50.453 --&gt; 11:53.023
Buys us some time to get inside
and find Ross's phone.

11:53.056 --&gt; 11:56.192
Won't...won't his phone
be with the cops?

11:56.226 --&gt; 11:57.493
Not out here.

11:57.527 --&gt; 11:59.195
Ross and all he had on him

11:59.229 --&gt; 12:00.663
will be processed
at the morgue first.

12:00.696 --&gt; 12:01.998
His clothes, his phone,

12:02.032 --&gt; 12:03.199
everything will be
bagged and tagged

12:03.233 --&gt; 12:04.567
and locked in the evidence room

12:04.600 --&gt; 12:06.202
for the sheriff
to claim in the morning,

12:06.236 --&gt; 12:08.338
along with the coroner's
autopsy report.

12:08.371 --&gt; 12:11.107
Walk the perimeter,
look for access.

12:11.141 --&gt; 12:13.944
Yeah, and I'm sure they have
a back door for graverobbers.

12:23.219 --&gt; 12:24.754
Hello?

12:24.787 --&gt; 12:27.924
I...I'm a friend
of the girl who was in the...

12:27.958 --&gt; 12:29.359
..the car accident tonight.

12:29.392 --&gt; 12:31.895
I was hoping that
I could see her

12:31.928 --&gt; 12:34.230
for one last goodbye.

12:43.173 --&gt; 12:44.807
-Oh, fuck!

12:44.841 --&gt; 12:47.610
-Oh, fucking hell!

12:49.645 --&gt; 12:52.815
Cujo's out back
and there's cameras everywhere.

12:52.849 --&gt; 12:55.118
-Fucking Fort Knox.

12:56.786 --&gt; 12:58.321
Hello?

12:58.354 --&gt; 13:00.190
This whole place
is locked down.

13:02.292 --&gt; 13:03.626
The only way
we're getting in

13:03.659 --&gt; 13:05.795
is through a fucking
body bag, you know?

13:10.100 --&gt; 13:12.602
-What if that can be arranged?
-Huh? What?

13:12.635 --&gt; 13:15.238
Do you still score Adderall
off that vet tech?

13:15.271 --&gt; 13:17.173
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it helps me focus.

13:17.207 --&gt; 13:18.841
I need you to call her.

13:23.179 --&gt; 13:24.380
Hey.

13:25.548 --&gt; 13:27.951
Whoa. Who is this?

13:27.984 --&gt; 13:31.854
Oh, this is my...my sister.

13:31.888 --&gt; 13:34.624
She...she's cool, so...

13:34.657 --&gt; 13:36.326
Hey.

13:36.359 --&gt; 13:38.228
Uh-huh.

13:42.966 --&gt; 13:44.968
-It's 50 for the Addy.
-And the propofol?

13:45.001 --&gt; 13:46.536
Listen, I got it.

13:46.569 --&gt; 13:48.671
But I need you to understand
that this shit is...

13:48.704 --&gt; 13:50.606
A sterile,
nonpyrogenic emulsion,

13:50.640 --&gt; 13:52.308
full name diisopropylphenyl.

13:52.342 --&gt; 13:53.509
It's used in the induction

13:53.543 --&gt; 13:55.611
and maintenance
of sedation anaesthesia,

13:55.645 --&gt; 13:58.448
and it works
by dramatically slowing down

13:58.481 --&gt; 14:00.483
the recipient's brain
and nervous system.

14:01.684 --&gt; 14:04.087
I study criminology
and forensic medicine.

14:06.589 --&gt; 14:08.191
150.

14:08.224 --&gt; 14:10.060
Come on. No deals today?

14:10.093 --&gt; 14:12.228
Shh. Here.

14:15.231 --&gt; 14:17.400
So I hope y'all know
what y'all doin'.

14:17.433 --&gt; 14:20.203
That shit killed
the King of Pop.

14:23.273 --&gt; 14:25.008
Yeah.

14:25.041 --&gt; 14:27.543
OK. Now what?

14:28.544 --&gt; 14:30.046
Now it's time to die.

14:34.884 --&gt; 14:37.253
How does this,
uh, work exactly?

14:37.287 --&gt; 14:38.688
I inject it.

14:38.721 --&gt; 14:40.223
A few seconds later,
I'll be unconscious.

14:40.256 --&gt; 14:41.724
The propofol slows
my heart rate

14:41.757 --&gt; 14:44.560
and brain activity
to almost nothing.

14:44.594 --&gt; 14:46.162
I'll still be alive.

14:46.196 --&gt; 14:48.364
I just have a bad feeling
about this, you know?

14:48.398 --&gt; 14:51.001
TJ,
it is after nine o'clock, OK?

14:51.034 --&gt; 14:53.403
By the morning, the sheriff is
going to be in that morgue,

14:53.436 --&gt; 14:55.205
hearing the results
of Ross's autopsy

14:55.238 --&gt; 14:56.706
and collecting his belongings.

14:56.739 --&gt; 14:59.175
How long after that do you think
it is going to take

14:59.209 --&gt; 15:01.744
until you are in custody?

15:05.615 --&gt; 15:08.018
Once I'm unconscious, you're
just gonna wait 30 minutes, OK?

15:08.051 --&gt; 15:09.752
What? Why?

15:09.785 --&gt; 15:12.922
Because I have to be cold
when they find me.

15:12.955 --&gt; 15:15.258
Otherwise, they'll...
they'll try to resuscitate.

15:16.259 --&gt; 15:18.928
Look, TJ, you are going
to wait 30 minutes.

15:18.961 --&gt; 15:21.564
You are then going to call 911
and you are going to say

15:21.597 --&gt; 15:23.799
that you saw a girl
OD in the underpass

15:23.833 --&gt; 15:25.468
and that you think
she might be dead,

15:25.501 --&gt; 15:27.870
but you aren't gonna give
a name or anything.

15:27.903 --&gt; 15:29.539
You understand that?

15:29.572 --&gt; 15:34.244
Yes, but as-assuming
this works,

15:34.277 --&gt; 15:36.046
how are you gonna get out?

15:36.079 --&gt; 15:39.082
Let's just worry about
getting me in first, yeah?

15:39.115 --&gt; 15:41.751
Look, I, um...
I should do this.

15:42.752 --&gt; 15:44.054
OK? Look, this was...
this was...

15:44.087 --&gt; 15:45.555
No, no, this was my mess-up.

15:45.588 --&gt; 15:47.257
Alright? Let me fix it.

15:47.290 --&gt; 15:50.460
You have any run-ins
with the local sheriff lately?

15:54.630 --&gt; 15:56.466
They won't remember me.

16:07.810 --&gt; 16:09.779
-Hey.

16:09.812 --&gt; 16:11.181
Hey.

16:12.615 --&gt; 16:15.285
You know I love you.

16:15.318 --&gt; 16:17.153
Don't. Don't do that.

16:33.536 --&gt; 16:35.305
OK.

16:35.338 --&gt; 16:38.241
Hey, you alright?

16:39.242 --&gt; 16:41.177
OK, you gotta go.
You gotta get out of here.

16:45.148 --&gt; 16:46.749
OK.

16:47.917 --&gt; 16:49.485
Love you.

16:49.519 --&gt; 16:50.853
It's alright.

18:37.593 --&gt; 18:39.028
Oh!

18:58.681 --&gt; 18:59.815
OK.

19:00.816 --&gt; 19:02.218
OK.

19:12.962 --&gt; 19:14.230
Oh...

19:15.965 --&gt; 19:17.533
Oh, shit! Sorry.

19:34.183 --&gt; 19:35.485
Oh!

23:45.334 --&gt; 23:47.236
Oh, God!

25:02.845 --&gt; 25:04.313
OK.

25:54.930 --&gt; 25:56.265
Shit, shit, shit...

25:56.298 --&gt; 25:57.332
OK.

27:00.162 --&gt; 27:02.732
Hey, you gonna
have Mannix waiting all day?

27:02.765 --&gt; 27:04.099
Come on already.

27:54.850 --&gt; 27:57.953
Yo, I'm here
for the seance.

27:57.987 --&gt; 28:00.890
No? No funnies today?

28:02.691 --&gt; 28:05.494
Man, this is no way
to spend your day.

28:05.527 --&gt; 28:08.163
You got a family,
dinner waiting for you at home?

28:08.197 --&gt; 28:10.365
Or are you too busy breakin'
bread with the dead, huh?

28:10.399 --&gt; 28:12.667
Come on, man!

28:12.701 --&gt; 28:14.703
What do you do for
a good time around here?

28:14.736 --&gt; 28:16.405
You got a girl back there
or something?

28:17.406 --&gt; 28:19.875
You know, every time
you hand me one of these,

28:19.909 --&gt; 28:22.411
I feel like we're
going to the beach.

28:22.444 --&gt; 28:24.880
Don't you wish there was
a sixpack in here, huh,

28:24.914 --&gt; 28:27.016
some Kool-Aid,
some chicken salad sandwiches?

28:27.049 --&gt; 28:30.085
Ooh, there she is.

28:30.119 --&gt; 28:33.222
Hey! Take it easy.

28:33.255 --&gt; 28:35.791
I'm just checking out
the merchandise.

28:37.893 --&gt; 28:39.361
Sheesh!

28:41.296 --&gt; 28:43.365
Oh, shit, I almost forgot.

28:43.398 --&gt; 28:47.669
About that guy in L.A.
looking for the liver?

28:47.702 --&gt; 28:50.172
Thank God for alcoholic
movie producers, huh?

28:51.606 --&gt; 28:54.109
Alright, well, let me know
if that works out

28:54.143 --&gt; 28:56.078
and you might see me
again tonight.

28:56.111 --&gt; 28:58.047
Lucky fuckin' me.

30:42.317 --&gt; 30:44.219
Oh, God.

30:48.223 --&gt; 30:49.992
You stupid asshole.

31:36.905 --&gt; 31:37.906
Ross!

31:37.939 --&gt; 31:39.508
Hey, hey, hey.

31:39.541 --&gt; 31:41.376
Shh! Shh! Shh!

31:41.410 --&gt; 31:44.113
Shh, shh! Hey. Shh, shh, shh!

31:44.146 --&gt; 31:45.714
Shh, shh!

31:47.749 --&gt; 31:50.285
It's Chloe. It's OK.

31:50.319 --&gt; 31:52.121
-What the...?

32:02.231 --&gt; 32:04.066
Why the hell
are you not in a hospital?

32:04.099 --&gt; 32:05.867
I am.

32:05.900 --&gt; 32:07.469
Who did this to you?

32:07.502 --&gt; 32:10.072
Was it the...
the guy with the keys?

32:10.105 --&gt; 32:11.573
Was it him? Yeah?

32:11.606 --&gt; 32:13.875
OK, was there anybody else?

32:13.908 --&gt; 32:16.378
Ross, have you seen
anybody else?

32:20.349 --&gt; 32:22.317
What the fuck is going on?

32:23.418 --&gt; 32:25.087
Chloe...

32:25.120 --&gt; 32:27.089
-Shh, shh!
-What are you doing here?

32:29.924 --&gt; 32:33.228
You dipshits planned
a robbery on an iPhone.

32:33.262 --&gt; 32:34.829
I know.

32:34.863 --&gt; 32:37.632
If I don't get it,
then TJ's going to jail.

32:39.934 --&gt; 32:41.436
It's not safe here.

32:41.470 --&gt; 32:42.737
What?

32:42.771 --&gt; 32:46.941
It's not safe here.

32:49.978 --&gt; 32:51.313
OK.

32:51.346 --&gt; 32:54.483
TJ's going to freak out,
he finds out you're alive.

32:54.516 --&gt; 32:56.418
I'm going to get
to the evidence room

32:56.451 --&gt; 32:58.853
and then I'm gonna get you
the hell out of here.

32:58.887 --&gt; 33:00.089
-OK.
-OK, good.

33:00.122 --&gt; 33:01.790
You know where the keys are?

33:02.791 --&gt; 33:04.326
Yeah, I know where they are.

33:05.560 --&gt; 33:07.129
I'll be back.

36:21.323 --&gt; 36:22.957
The order came through

36:22.991 --&gt; 36:24.659
for our man in L.A.

36:24.693 --&gt; 36:26.528
Mannix will be by in an hour.

36:51.085 --&gt; 36:53.555
Ross? OK. Hey!

36:53.588 --&gt; 36:55.690
I need you to get up, OK?

36:55.724 --&gt; 36:57.892
Ross? Ross!

36:59.060 --&gt; 37:01.430
OK. Hurry.

37:01.463 --&gt; 37:03.031
I know. Look.

37:03.064 --&gt; 37:05.467
I need you to come with me. OK?

37:06.601 --&gt; 37:07.936
Shit, I'm sorry.

37:07.969 --&gt; 37:10.171
-I'm sorry! Shh, shh!

37:12.240 --&gt; 37:13.708
OK.

37:14.776 --&gt; 37:16.378
I have the keys.

37:16.411 --&gt; 37:19.614
You need to get up
with me right now, OK?

37:19.648 --&gt; 37:21.015
-Come on.

37:21.049 --&gt; 37:23.184
-I know it hurts. Shh! Shh!

37:25.720 --&gt; 37:27.188
OK. I got you.

37:27.221 --&gt; 37:29.123
Good job. Ready? Almost there.

37:29.157 --&gt; 37:30.392
Just lean onto me.

37:30.425 --&gt; 37:32.427
-I know. Shh, shh!

37:32.461 --&gt; 37:34.863
-I got you...

37:34.896 --&gt; 37:36.297
-OK, you alright?
-Yeah.

37:36.331 --&gt; 37:38.299
-Shh!

37:38.333 --&gt; 37:39.601
-OK?
-Alright.

37:39.634 --&gt; 37:41.903
We need to go.
We need to go, OK?

37:41.936 --&gt; 37:43.572
-I know it hurts.

37:43.605 --&gt; 37:44.939
They cut you.

37:44.973 --&gt; 37:47.208
-Hey, hey.

37:48.643 --&gt; 37:50.078
-Ross.
-Oh!

37:50.111 --&gt; 37:51.846
Ross, would you look at me?

37:53.081 --&gt; 37:54.749
We have to go.

37:55.950 --&gt; 37:57.486
-Now.
-OK.

37:57.519 --&gt; 38:01.189
-OK? Come on. I got you.
-Fuck!

38:20.208 --&gt; 38:23.011
OK.
You see the door?

38:23.044 --&gt; 38:25.146
We're going to get
through it, OK?

38:25.179 --&gt; 38:26.815
-OK, go. Right there.
-Oh! OK, OK, OK.

38:26.848 --&gt; 38:28.650
OK.

38:30.785 --&gt; 38:31.953
OK.

38:41.796 --&gt; 38:43.097
-Oh, God.

38:43.131 --&gt; 38:45.299
Fuck.

39:26.407 --&gt; 39:29.310
Chloe, what did they do to me?

39:29.343 --&gt; 39:31.613
They took your kidney, Ross.

39:33.782 --&gt; 39:35.584
They what?

39:35.617 --&gt; 39:38.687
That's OK, though,
because you have another one.

39:38.720 --&gt; 39:41.189
Son of a bitch.

39:42.557 --&gt; 39:45.159
-Got it. Come on. Right now.

39:45.193 --&gt; 39:47.395
-OK.
-OK. Shh, shh, shh, shh!

39:47.428 --&gt; 39:49.430
OK.

39:49.464 --&gt; 39:51.265
-Fuck!
-Shh, shh!

39:51.299 --&gt; 39:52.867
Alright.

40:14.455 --&gt; 40:17.091
I'll slow you down.

40:17.125 --&gt; 40:18.960
You know you...you just
gotta go, right?

40:18.993 --&gt; 40:20.695
-I'm not leaving.
-What?

40:20.729 --&gt; 40:22.697
When I open this door,
you are going to run.

40:22.731 --&gt; 40:24.465
I still need to get
into the evidence room.

40:24.499 --&gt; 40:26.234
-OK.

40:26.267 --&gt; 40:28.436
OK. Almost there.

40:36.244 --&gt; 40:39.347
-Oh, shit.

40:42.283 --&gt; 40:43.985
He sees us.

40:49.924 --&gt; 40:51.259
-Chloe...
-Shh!

40:51.292 --&gt; 40:52.594
Shit.

40:52.627 --&gt; 40:54.262
He knows we're in here.

40:54.295 --&gt; 40:56.865
-OK.
-Fuck.

41:07.008 --&gt; 41:08.677
OK.

41:12.013 --&gt; 41:14.949
He's coming. He's coming.

41:14.983 --&gt; 41:18.319
Hey, hey, Chloe?
I'm...I'm sorry.

41:18.352 --&gt; 41:20.454
I fucked up.
I'm sorry for all of it.

41:20.488 --&gt; 41:22.624
I will stop him, OK?
You just fuckin' go.

41:22.657 --&gt; 41:24.092
Hey.

41:24.125 --&gt; 41:26.661
You cut the macho shit
right now, OK?

41:26.695 --&gt; 41:29.363
You left me once. You're not
fuckin' doing it again.

41:32.567 --&gt; 41:33.968
OK...

41:37.005 --&gt; 41:39.540
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't have ever left.

41:39.574 --&gt; 41:41.876
Where is it?
Last key, Ross.

41:41.910 --&gt; 41:43.444
Here we go.

41:43.477 --&gt; 41:45.046
We're on the last one.

41:46.047 --&gt; 41:48.449
-I got it!

41:48.482 --&gt; 41:49.684
Ross!

41:49.718 --&gt; 41:51.352
No. Ross.

41:51.385 --&gt; 41:54.322
Hey, I got the door, OK?
I need you to get up.

41:54.355 --&gt; 41:56.324
Come on, come on.
I need you to move.

41:56.357 --&gt; 41:59.327
OK, I need you to come.

41:59.360 --&gt; 42:01.229
Come on.

42:01.262 --&gt; 42:02.831
OK.

42:02.864 --&gt; 42:05.199
Come on, Ross.

42:27.889 --&gt; 42:29.691
Ross...

42:33.361 --&gt; 42:35.964
Ross, Ross...

42:42.536 --&gt; 42:44.372
I doubt
he can hear you.

42:48.542 --&gt; 42:50.912
OK...please,

42:50.945 --&gt; 42:52.714
please, just let us go.

42:52.747 --&gt; 42:54.615
I won't say anything
to anybody, please.

42:54.649 --&gt; 42:56.384
And where would you go?

42:56.417 --&gt; 42:58.920
Back to your
rat-infested apartment?

42:58.953 --&gt; 43:00.922
To your tent city?

43:00.955 --&gt; 43:03.224
To your life of crime?

43:03.257 --&gt; 43:05.293
What? No.

43:06.961 --&gt; 43:09.764
No, that's...that's not me.

43:09.798 --&gt; 43:11.199
Then what are you doing here?

43:11.232 --&gt; 43:13.902
Attempting to claim that
which does not belong to you?

43:13.935 --&gt; 43:15.937
Do you think you're
deserving of it in some way,

43:15.970 --&gt; 43:17.238
that you've earned it?

43:17.271 --&gt; 43:19.874
Compensation for the toils

43:19.908 --&gt; 43:22.143
and petty grievances
that you've accrued

43:22.176 --&gt; 43:24.946
during your time on this Earth?

43:27.816 --&gt; 43:29.818
Maybe you feel like you got
dealt a bad hand

43:29.851 --&gt; 43:30.985
and you should be allowed

43:31.019 --&gt; 43:32.987
to slip a few extra aces
up your sleeve.

43:33.021 --&gt; 43:34.756
You ever considered
getting a job

43:34.789 --&gt; 43:38.126
or is...that completely
out of the question?

43:38.159 --&gt; 43:40.561
This country's filled
with people like you,

43:40.594 --&gt; 43:42.563
people who take, take, take.

43:42.596 --&gt; 43:44.565
They don't earn. You cheat.

43:44.598 --&gt; 43:46.768
You don't strive.
You cut corners.

43:46.801 --&gt; 43:48.669
You take shortcuts.

43:48.703 --&gt; 43:51.572
No, that's not me, though.

43:51.605 --&gt; 43:53.775
Fortunately for me,

43:53.808 --&gt; 43:58.479
you are all defined
by one undeniable truth.

43:58.512 --&gt; 43:59.848
All that you are...

44:02.216 --&gt; 44:05.754
..all that you've done,
all of your thoughts,

44:05.787 --&gt; 44:09.190
your feelings, your beliefs...

44:10.658 --&gt; 44:13.027
..your entire being

44:13.061 --&gt; 44:15.563
is worth considerably less...

44:17.732 --&gt; 44:19.533
..than the sum of your parts.

44:22.636 --&gt; 44:23.704
No.

44:25.039 --&gt; 44:26.507
No, no, no, no. Please, please.

44:26.540 --&gt; 44:28.342
Please. OK? You're wrong.

44:28.376 --&gt; 44:29.710
I...I am a student

44:29.744 --&gt; 44:31.545
and I know the opportunity
I have been given.

44:31.579 --&gt; 44:34.515
-I wanna make something out...
-What are you studying?

44:35.750 --&gt; 44:38.887
I study...I study...
forensic medicine.

44:42.857 --&gt; 44:44.525
That's an
underappreciated field.

44:44.558 --&gt; 44:46.227
Yeah.

44:46.260 --&gt; 44:47.896
Then you already know
that there are

44:47.929 --&gt; 44:51.365
over a million dollars' worth
of assets inside of you.

44:51.399 --&gt; 44:55.804
Kidney, heart,
liver, lungs, eyes.

44:55.837 --&gt; 44:57.705
That's before we get
into your plasma,

44:57.738 --&gt; 44:59.073
your bone marrow.

44:59.107 --&gt; 45:02.710
Even your skin bears a price.

45:02.743 --&gt; 45:05.213
You should have
valued yourself higher

45:05.246 --&gt; 45:07.348
before you broke
into this sacred place.

45:07.381 --&gt; 45:10.184
-I didn't have a choice.
-Of course you had a choice.

45:10.218 --&gt; 45:11.752
Just like he had a choice.

45:11.786 --&gt; 45:13.654
You obviously know
this young man.

45:13.687 --&gt; 45:16.024
Caught earlier this morning...

45:17.591 --&gt; 45:20.929
..cutting another corner,
taking another shortcut.

45:22.596 --&gt; 45:24.665
Look, I know
what he did was wrong.

45:24.698 --&gt; 45:26.835
I get that. I'm pissed.

45:26.868 --&gt; 45:30.204
But he...
he does not deserve...

45:30.238 --&gt; 45:32.040
Of course he deserves it.

45:32.073 --&gt; 45:34.876
Who wouldn't vote
to end this wretch's life

45:34.909 --&gt; 45:36.878
if it meant saving
a more worthy person,

45:36.911 --&gt; 45:38.579
a person of value?

45:41.249 --&gt; 45:43.651
You think life
is essentially fair?

45:46.254 --&gt; 45:48.622
Well, unfortunately,
life is not fair.

45:48.656 --&gt; 45:51.625
I know that life isn't fair.

45:51.659 --&gt; 45:54.728
Hey, I know that!
I know that...

45:54.762 --&gt; 45:57.899
-OK.
-And what is your excuse?

46:04.672 --&gt; 46:06.307
My excuse?

46:07.441 --&gt; 46:09.944
My excuse is that
the medical examiner,

46:09.978 --&gt; 46:13.814
he determined my dad's
cause of death as suicide.

46:13.848 --&gt; 46:17.051
But it wasn't suicide.
I know that it wasn't suicide.

46:17.085 --&gt; 46:19.787
He suffered from PTSD,
psychotic episodes

46:19.820 --&gt; 46:21.422
and he was heavily medicated.

46:21.455 --&gt; 46:23.557
And then the insurance,
they cut off his medication...

46:23.591 --&gt; 46:26.327
Ah, suicide cancelled
the insurance policy

46:26.360 --&gt; 46:29.998
and you and Mommy
didn't get any money.

46:30.031 --&gt; 46:31.599
Sad tale.

46:31.632 --&gt; 46:33.101
A common one.

46:33.134 --&gt; 46:34.903
-A victim's excuse.
-No.

46:34.936 --&gt; 46:37.906
No, I am not
who you think I am, OK?

46:37.939 --&gt; 46:39.340
I got into forensics

46:39.373 --&gt; 46:41.675
because I want to help people
find the truth, like...

46:41.709 --&gt; 46:45.746
The truth is what I say
the truth is.

46:45.779 --&gt; 46:48.482
Your father was a pathetic loser

46:48.516 --&gt; 46:52.153
that did the world a favour
by ending his life.

46:52.186 --&gt; 46:56.024
And you, when you broke in here,
ended your life.

46:57.858 --&gt; 47:01.062
You are a sick man.

47:02.063 --&gt; 47:03.631
I'm not sick.

47:04.632 --&gt; 47:06.167
I'm the cure.

47:12.040 --&gt; 47:15.476
No! No! No!

47:15.509 --&gt; 47:17.511
Please stop!

47:24.752 --&gt; 47:26.087
Please, please, please!

47:32.360 --&gt; 47:34.562
-Oh!

47:48.709 --&gt; 47:51.179
It's OK, it's OK...

48:15.136 --&gt; 48:17.438
-No, no!

48:17.471 --&gt; 48:18.872
No!

48:31.952 --&gt; 48:33.254
Ross...

48:41.129 --&gt; 48:42.563
You know
this used to be

48:42.596 --&gt; 48:44.298
the largest hospital
in the county?

48:46.067 --&gt; 48:48.669
Now it's just me down here.

48:52.273 --&gt; 48:56.410
And I do not like
uninvited guests.

49:31.612 --&gt; 49:33.314
No...

49:33.347 --&gt; 49:35.283
Please!

49:35.316 --&gt; 49:36.584
No, please.

49:36.617 --&gt; 49:39.087
Please, I'm sorry!
Please!

49:39.120 --&gt; 49:40.488
Shh-shh-shh-shh!

49:42.556 --&gt; 49:43.857
Shh, shh. It's OK, it's OK.

49:43.891 --&gt; 49:45.359
Listen, listen, listen.

49:45.393 --&gt; 49:48.196
Not one word.

49:52.233 --&gt; 49:53.934
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, Dad.

49:53.967 --&gt; 49:55.803
Mom wants to know
if you're coming home tonight.

49:55.836 --&gt; 49:59.140
Oh, no, honey, I can't make it.
Daddy's working.

49:59.173 --&gt; 50:00.974
Oh. We miss you.

50:01.008 --&gt; 50:02.643
I miss you too.

50:02.676 --&gt; 50:04.612
I'll see you
for breakfast tomorrow.

50:04.645 --&gt; 50:06.847
Don't forget to call Brad
before school.

50:06.880 --&gt; 50:08.482
I won't.

50:08.516 --&gt; 50:09.650
Love you.

50:10.651 --&gt; 50:12.220
Love you too.

50:22.596 --&gt; 50:27.535
I don't know what you want.
I'm sorry. I'm...

50:27.568 --&gt; 50:29.170
Thank you for that.

50:30.938 --&gt; 50:34.242
Know that his death and yours

50:34.275 --&gt; 50:37.178
will bring renewed life
to someone who's willing

50:37.211 --&gt; 50:40.080
to sacrifice everything
for their beliefs

50:40.114 --&gt; 50:41.882
and now, thanks to me,

50:41.915 --&gt; 50:44.918
your trivial existence
will have meaning.

50:44.952 --&gt; 50:47.087
I'm going to give your
life worth,

50:47.121 --&gt; 50:50.424
piece by piece...

50:50.458 --&gt; 50:52.393
..by piece.

50:59.600 --&gt; 51:00.768
No...

52:07.968 --&gt; 52:10.604
OK, OK, OK.

52:13.807 --&gt; 52:16.377
OK. OK.

52:22.783 --&gt; 52:25.719
I'm sorry, sorry.

52:28.489 --&gt; 52:30.758
I'm sorry.

52:30.791 --&gt; 52:32.560
OK. Alright.

52:33.561 --&gt; 52:34.995
Yes.

52:37.331 --&gt; 52:40.000
OK.

52:46.206 --&gt; 52:47.675
OK.

53:00.087 --&gt; 53:02.323
Come on. Please.

53:05.426 --&gt; 53:06.994
Come on.

54:36.316 --&gt; 54:38.018
Ahh!

59:04.618 --&gt; 59:05.953
Eight...

01:00:47.454 --&gt; 01:00:48.822
Give it to me.

01:00:50.123 --&gt; 01:00:52.392
This is what this is all about?

01:00:53.393 --&gt; 01:00:55.495
Some dead loser's cell phone?

01:00:55.528 --&gt; 01:00:59.332
Just give me the fucking phone.

01:00:59.366 --&gt; 01:01:03.503
You know, for someone who's
a scholar of forensic science,

01:01:03.536 --&gt; 01:01:06.206
you should know a little more
about protocol procedure.

01:01:06.239 --&gt; 01:01:10.310
We would never leave
a live firearm unattended...

01:01:11.344 --&gt; 01:01:15.548
..which means that gun
is either unloaded...

01:01:17.684 --&gt; 01:01:19.086
..or it's fake.

01:01:25.192 --&gt; 01:01:27.160
-Give it to me!

01:01:27.194 --&gt; 01:01:28.628
Oh!

01:01:39.606 --&gt; 01:01:42.009
No... No!

01:01:43.010 --&gt; 01:01:44.244
Damn!

01:04:09.089 --&gt; 01:04:11.191
-Sorry...

01:04:11.224 --&gt; 01:04:13.326
Help me.

01:04:14.327 --&gt; 01:04:16.029
Please.

01:04:16.063 --&gt; 01:04:18.265
I'm sorry.

01:04:19.532 --&gt; 01:04:22.702
-Oh! Ah!

01:04:29.709 --&gt; 01:04:32.745
-Shh, shh, shh!

01:04:42.055 --&gt; 01:04:43.623
Oh, my God.

01:04:47.527 --&gt; 01:04:49.362
Chloe.

01:04:49.396 --&gt; 01:04:50.930
Can you hear me?

01:04:51.931 --&gt; 01:04:53.466
Up here.

01:04:54.601 --&gt; 01:04:56.936
I assume TJ is your brother.

01:04:58.871 --&gt; 01:05:01.074
Naughty little boy, isn't he?

01:05:01.108 --&gt; 01:05:03.543
In literature,
they refer to him

01:05:03.576 --&gt; 01:05:05.445
as an irredeemable character,

01:05:05.478 --&gt; 01:05:07.080
loathsome.

01:05:07.114 --&gt; 01:05:09.649
I'm sure you disagree.

01:05:10.917 --&gt; 01:05:13.253
I can tell
he's had his problems.

01:05:13.286 --&gt; 01:05:15.422
Probably renders him
sympathetic in your view.

01:05:15.455 --&gt; 01:05:17.524
But to me,
he's just a pile of dog shit

01:05:17.557 --&gt; 01:05:18.958
on a pristine carpet

01:05:18.992 --&gt; 01:05:20.293
and tarnishing the environment

01:05:20.327 --&gt; 01:05:21.894
for those of us
that are hard-working,

01:05:21.928 --&gt; 01:05:23.696
those of us
that are law-abiding

01:05:23.730 --&gt; 01:05:24.864
and those of us

01:05:24.897 --&gt; 01:05:26.799
that contribute.

01:05:32.239 --&gt; 01:05:34.141
Luckily, the cell phone

01:05:34.174 --&gt; 01:05:36.909
you've risked so much for
holds the key

01:05:36.943 --&gt; 01:05:40.247
that will imprison
your feeble-minded brother

01:05:40.280 --&gt; 01:05:43.483
for what's left
of his worthless life.

01:05:43.516 --&gt; 01:05:45.785
You know what they call
someone like TJ in prison,

01:05:45.818 --&gt; 01:05:47.320
Chloe?

01:05:47.354 --&gt; 01:05:49.956
They call them "June bugs".

01:05:49.989 --&gt; 01:05:52.392
Do you know why
they call them June bugs?

01:05:52.425 --&gt; 01:05:55.295
Because they only live
for six months.

01:06:00.800 --&gt; 01:06:03.270
But I believe you sought
to better your life.

01:06:06.606 --&gt; 01:06:09.476
But your delinquent brother
pulled you back into this world

01:06:09.509 --&gt; 01:06:11.811
and now you are one step away

01:06:11.844 --&gt; 01:06:13.713
from Ross's fate.

01:06:18.685 --&gt; 01:06:20.887
Turn yourself in to me
now, Chloe.

01:06:51.318 --&gt; 01:06:55.455
Here she is.
Yes. Go find her.

01:07:22.849 --&gt; 01:07:24.050
Hello?

01:07:24.083 --&gt; 01:07:25.618
TJ?

01:07:26.719 --&gt; 01:07:28.221
Oh, Chloe, where are you?

01:07:28.255 --&gt; 01:07:29.822
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

01:07:29.856 --&gt; 01:07:33.226
I'm...I'm still inside.

01:07:33.260 --&gt; 01:07:35.428
Are you alright?

01:07:35.462 --&gt; 01:07:36.763
TJ...

01:07:36.796 --&gt; 01:07:39.499
Look, they, uh...

01:07:39.532 --&gt; 01:07:42.769
..they hurt people here.

01:07:42.802 --&gt; 01:07:45.372
OK, wh-what do you mean?

01:07:46.439 --&gt; 01:07:50.610
I don't know. It's really
hard to explain right now.

01:07:50.643 --&gt; 01:07:52.579
-Chloe...
-TJ, I...

01:07:52.612 --&gt; 01:07:55.515
I think I failed you.
I'm so sorry.

01:07:55.548 --&gt; 01:07:58.251
I can't get your phone.
I tried really hard.

01:07:58.285 --&gt; 01:07:59.819
I promise.

01:08:01.053 --&gt; 01:08:03.756
-Are you in danger?
-No, you don't worry about me.

01:08:03.790 --&gt; 01:08:06.359
I need you to get
the hell out of this state.

01:08:06.393 --&gt; 01:08:07.727
Chloe, I'm not
leaving the state.

01:08:07.760 --&gt; 01:08:10.830
I am not asking you
right now, OK? I...

01:08:12.899 --&gt; 01:08:15.635
Look, I couldn't save Mom.

01:08:16.736 --&gt; 01:08:19.806
I couldn't help Dad,
and I am not being the one

01:08:19.839 --&gt; 01:08:22.309
to lose you too,
so I need you to listen to me.

01:08:22.342 --&gt; 01:08:24.911
I'm not leaving you.
Chloe, just stay where you are.

01:08:24.944 --&gt; 01:08:27.214
TJ, now, you listen to me
right now.

01:08:28.581 --&gt; 01:08:30.817
TJ?

01:08:30.850 --&gt; 01:08:32.419
Hello?

01:08:37.590 --&gt; 01:08:39.158
I had to cut the line.

01:08:39.192 --&gt; 01:08:41.694
Can't have you making
outgoing calls.

01:08:42.662 --&gt; 01:08:44.297
-Don't worry about him.

01:08:44.331 --&gt; 01:08:45.965
He's a good boy.

01:08:45.998 --&gt; 01:08:50.036
He's trained to maim
and detain, not kill.

01:09:10.657 --&gt; 01:09:12.259
Hi.

01:09:12.292 --&gt; 01:09:15.628
Yeah, um, I'd like to speak
to the sheriff.

01:09:45.525 --&gt; 01:09:46.959
Sheriff.

01:09:46.993 --&gt; 01:09:49.862
Well, if it ain't TJ Albright.

01:09:49.896 --&gt; 01:09:52.031
What can I do for you
this fine evening?

01:09:53.266 --&gt; 01:09:55.034
I'll, uh...I'll...

01:09:57.670 --&gt; 01:09:59.171
..I'll confess.

01:09:59.205 --&gt; 01:10:02.342
I just, um... I need you
to do something for me first.

01:10:02.375 --&gt; 01:10:04.377
What's that?

01:10:05.345 --&gt; 01:10:07.414
I need you to save my sister.

01:10:09.416 --&gt; 01:10:11.451
Oh, shit.

01:10:59.298 --&gt; 01:11:00.767
Alright.

01:11:00.800 --&gt; 01:11:02.969
You want it? You like this?

01:11:03.002 --&gt; 01:11:04.971
-OK, OK.

01:11:05.004 --&gt; 01:11:06.639
OK, OK!

01:12:01.994 --&gt; 01:12:03.396
TJ.

01:12:22.314 --&gt; 01:12:23.583
Slow down there, tiger.

01:12:28.154 --&gt; 01:12:30.823
Oh, God! Oh! Sheriff!

01:12:30.857 --&gt; 01:12:33.359
We need to...we need
to go outside right now.

01:12:33.392 --&gt; 01:12:35.562
-Miss Chloe Albright.
-Don't...

01:12:35.595 --&gt; 01:12:37.997
TJ here was bullshitting me.

01:12:39.699 --&gt; 01:12:42.502
Ooh... It's OK, TJ.

01:12:42.535 --&gt; 01:12:45.071
What in Christ's name
is going on?

01:12:45.104 --&gt; 01:12:47.574
OK, um...

01:12:47.607 --&gt; 01:12:49.642
OK, look, the coroner,

01:12:49.676 --&gt; 01:12:52.679
OK, he...he's...he's keeping
people alive, OK?

01:12:52.712 --&gt; 01:12:54.313
He is selling...
he is selling their organs

01:12:54.346 --&gt; 01:12:56.583
and bits and parts of them

01:12:56.616 --&gt; 01:12:59.251
and I think he has killed
a lot of people.

01:12:59.285 --&gt; 01:13:01.521
That's quite an accusation
this late on a Friday.

01:13:01.554 --&gt; 01:13:04.524
You need to get in there, OK?
I saw him. I saw him.

01:13:10.129 --&gt; 01:13:11.831
It's OK.

01:13:11.864 --&gt; 01:13:15.835
Sheriff, he murdered somebody

01:13:15.868 --&gt; 01:13:17.937
right in front of me.

01:13:17.970 --&gt; 01:13:19.872
Come on.

01:13:19.906 --&gt; 01:13:21.941
I never liked this coroner.

01:13:21.974 --&gt; 01:13:23.843
Old-timer before him,
he was easy.

01:13:23.876 --&gt; 01:13:26.078
This guy's
a pretentious nightmare.

01:13:26.112 --&gt; 01:13:27.413
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:27.446 --&gt; 01:13:30.216
If he's the psycho
you say he is,

01:13:30.249 --&gt; 01:13:32.251
I'm looking forward to being

01:13:32.284 --&gt; 01:13:35.054
the swift boot of justice
up his ass.

01:13:36.255 --&gt; 01:13:37.957
Tell you what.

01:13:37.990 --&gt; 01:13:39.458
You two stay put

01:13:39.492 --&gt; 01:13:41.794
while I go see what's what.

01:13:41.828 --&gt; 01:13:43.195
OK, OK.

01:13:43.229 --&gt; 01:13:45.965
But, Sheriff,
you need to be careful.

01:13:46.966 --&gt; 01:13:48.801
I'm telling you,
he's dangerous.

01:13:49.802 --&gt; 01:13:50.937
OK.

01:13:51.938 --&gt; 01:13:54.607
Thank you. TJ...

01:13:54.641 --&gt; 01:13:55.608
Oh!

01:13:57.143 --&gt; 01:13:58.711
What the fuck?!

01:13:58.745 --&gt; 01:14:01.080
TJ, TJ, just run! TJ!

01:14:01.113 --&gt; 01:14:03.783
Dangerous, huh? Well, so am I.

01:14:03.816 --&gt; 01:14:05.451
Get...

01:14:06.686 --&gt; 01:14:08.755
No!

01:14:08.788 --&gt; 01:14:10.456
-Mm-mm, no.
-No, no, no!

01:14:10.489 --&gt; 01:14:12.424
-Oh!

01:14:12.458 --&gt; 01:14:14.160
Oh! TJ!

01:14:19.799 --&gt; 01:14:21.768
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

01:14:21.801 --&gt; 01:14:23.636
..shut the fuck up!

01:14:23.670 --&gt; 01:14:25.672
-Whoa...
-Let's go.

01:14:25.705 --&gt; 01:14:29.341
-OK...
-Get the fuck away from him!

01:14:32.945 --&gt; 01:14:34.280
Hey, now.

01:14:35.481 --&gt; 01:14:37.650
Let's not be hasty.

01:14:39.285 --&gt; 01:14:40.853
Is that Ross's gun?

01:14:42.154 --&gt; 01:14:43.990
Put the gun on the ground,
Miss Albright.

01:14:44.023 --&gt; 01:14:47.393
TJ, TJ, get behind me right now.

01:14:48.394 --&gt; 01:14:50.663
Chloe, we should just
do what he says.

01:14:50.697 --&gt; 01:14:52.164
No.

01:14:52.198 --&gt; 01:14:54.200
No, we are walking out of here.

01:14:54.233 --&gt; 01:14:55.868
Don't make me kill you.

01:14:56.869 --&gt; 01:14:58.304
You wouldn't...

01:14:58.337 --&gt; 01:15:00.773
..because we're more
valuable to you alive.

01:15:00.807 --&gt; 01:15:02.174
Right?

01:15:05.544 --&gt; 01:15:06.946
Yeah.

01:15:06.979 --&gt; 01:15:09.181
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

01:15:17.323 --&gt; 01:15:19.225
The gun is fake.

01:15:22.094 --&gt; 01:15:24.731
The gun is fake.

01:15:26.733 --&gt; 01:15:28.034
Shit.

01:15:32.004 --&gt; 01:15:33.205
Now...

01:15:34.607 --&gt; 01:15:36.843
..this one is real.

01:15:36.876 --&gt; 01:15:39.545
Changes your odds of survival
a little bit, now, don't it?

01:15:39.578 --&gt; 01:15:41.614
Oh, TJ...

01:15:42.849 --&gt; 01:15:45.685
I want them alive.

01:15:45.718 --&gt; 01:15:48.755
Oh, come on, man! You serious?

01:15:48.788 --&gt; 01:15:50.156
-I just...
-Hyah!

01:15:50.189 --&gt; 01:15:52.558
-Oh!
-Move! Run, TJ!

01:15:54.794 --&gt; 01:15:56.128
Go!

01:16:02.902 --&gt; 01:16:05.104
TJ, the gate! TJ!

01:16:07.740 --&gt; 01:16:09.575
-We're trapped...
-No, no, no, that's not good.

01:16:09.608 --&gt; 01:16:11.443
That's not good.
That's not good.

01:16:40.472 --&gt; 01:16:43.375
Bad...dog.

01:16:45.778 --&gt; 01:16:47.747
-Come on.
-OK.

01:16:47.780 --&gt; 01:16:49.248
Shit! Go!

01:17:13.672 --&gt; 01:17:16.843
That-a-boy, Mac.
Burn 'em down.

01:17:21.680 --&gt; 01:17:23.582
Go!

01:17:26.552 --&gt; 01:17:28.855
Let's go. Go.
Just go. Go! Go, go!

01:17:33.192 --&gt; 01:17:34.393
Fuck.

01:17:50.409 --&gt; 01:17:51.844
TJ?

01:17:54.546 --&gt; 01:17:55.714
TJ?!

01:17:57.516 --&gt; 01:17:58.550
TJ!

01:18:09.228 --&gt; 01:18:12.331
-Shit! No! Chloe!

01:18:14.834 --&gt; 01:18:16.535
Chloe! Fuck!

01:18:19.738 --&gt; 01:18:22.241
Chloe!

01:18:23.609 --&gt; 01:18:24.844
TJ!

01:18:24.877 --&gt; 01:18:26.813
Let me go!

01:18:26.846 --&gt; 01:18:28.047
Chloe!

01:18:38.390 --&gt; 01:18:40.259
-Chloe!

01:18:40.292 --&gt; 01:18:42.194
-Get off!
-Chloe!

01:18:42.228 --&gt; 01:18:44.696
Get off me! Get off me!

01:18:47.199 --&gt; 01:18:49.601
-Get off of him! Get off of him!

01:18:49.635 --&gt; 01:18:51.904
Get off of him! Get off!

01:18:53.572 --&gt; 01:18:55.341
Come on, get him off!
Get him off!

01:18:56.943 --&gt; 01:19:00.179
Get him off! Get him off!

01:19:23.402 --&gt; 01:19:25.571
TJ? TJ?

01:19:27.639 --&gt; 01:19:30.642
-You have to get up.
-No, I need a minute, OK? No.

01:19:33.445 --&gt; 01:19:36.248
Come on. You've got to get up.

01:19:36.282 --&gt; 01:19:37.549
You've got to get up.

01:19:42.621 --&gt; 01:19:45.491
Slow down, down.
Fuck. Alright.

01:19:45.524 --&gt; 01:19:47.593
OK, we're trapped.

01:19:49.295 --&gt; 01:19:51.263
OK.

01:19:53.299 --&gt; 01:19:54.934
OK, it's locked.
We got to break in.

01:19:54.967 --&gt; 01:19:57.003
Look on the ground, OK?

01:20:00.772 --&gt; 01:20:01.941
-This will work.
-Yeah.

01:20:01.974 --&gt; 01:20:03.109
OK, OK.

01:20:03.142 --&gt; 01:20:04.810
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

01:20:04.843 --&gt; 01:20:06.612
-I need you to twist it.
-I know.

01:20:09.215 --&gt; 01:20:10.616
-One, two...
-Come on.

01:20:12.151 --&gt; 01:20:13.585
-OK, that's it.
-Yep, go.

01:20:13.619 --&gt; 01:20:16.288
-OK, OK.

01:20:38.010 --&gt; 01:20:39.845
You OK, bud?

01:20:39.878 --&gt; 01:20:41.580
They rattle your brain?

01:20:50.589 --&gt; 01:20:52.158
Where are they?

01:20:53.325 --&gt; 01:20:55.661
They went down there.

01:20:55.694 --&gt; 01:20:57.896
Keep 'em there
till we can drive them to us.

01:20:59.698 --&gt; 01:21:01.700
-How?
-Smoke 'em out.

01:21:01.733 --&gt; 01:21:03.335
Tear gas in my car.

01:21:06.838 --&gt; 01:21:08.374
What the fuck is that?

01:21:08.407 --&gt; 01:21:10.309
Mannix.

01:21:10.342 --&gt; 01:21:11.443
Shit!

01:21:12.444 --&gt; 01:21:14.780
No-one's supposed to know
about me, remember?

01:21:26.425 --&gt; 01:21:28.227
TJ.

01:21:28.260 --&gt; 01:21:30.562
Come here. Come here.

01:21:30.596 --&gt; 01:21:32.331
-OK? It's OK.
-I'm so sorry, Chloe.

01:21:32.364 --&gt; 01:21:34.100
-No.
-I'm sorry.

01:21:34.133 --&gt; 01:21:36.735
It's OK. It's OK.

01:21:37.803 --&gt; 01:21:40.072
-You're OK.
-I'm sorry, Chloe.

01:21:40.106 --&gt; 01:21:41.440
Hey.

01:21:41.473 --&gt; 01:21:43.009
It is going to be OK.

01:21:43.042 --&gt; 01:21:44.243
-Shh!
-No, it's not.

01:21:44.276 --&gt; 01:21:45.844
-No, we're trapped.
-Look at me.

01:21:45.877 --&gt; 01:21:47.980
There is going to be
a way out of here.

01:21:49.315 --&gt; 01:21:51.050
You need to trust me.

01:21:51.083 --&gt; 01:21:52.684
-Yeah, OK.
-OK.

01:21:52.718 --&gt; 01:21:54.353
-We're a team.
-Yeah, I know.

01:21:54.386 --&gt; 01:21:56.022
Come on.

01:22:04.330 --&gt; 01:22:05.697
"Wow, look at me.

01:22:05.731 --&gt; 01:22:07.099
"I'm the coroner. I got keys."

01:22:07.133 --&gt; 01:22:09.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, open up the door.

01:22:18.310 --&gt; 01:22:19.445
What's the deal?

01:22:19.478 --&gt; 01:22:21.147
You're not gonna
let me in this time?

01:22:22.148 --&gt; 01:22:24.183
There's been a situation
with the liver.

01:22:27.653 --&gt; 01:22:30.289
-I lost it.
-What?

01:22:30.322 --&gt; 01:22:32.391
What the fuck, man?
That puts us down 100 grand.

01:22:32.424 --&gt; 01:22:34.926
I'm in the process
of replacing it.

01:22:34.960 --&gt; 01:22:37.096
I need you to come back
in an hour.

01:22:38.930 --&gt; 01:22:40.632
What the fuck
is up with your eye?

01:22:42.934 --&gt; 01:22:45.437
Why did you change
this shit up on me?

01:22:45.471 --&gt; 01:22:48.440
You know Mannix is
a creature of habit.

01:22:48.474 --&gt; 01:22:50.609
You're making me nervous.

01:22:50.642 --&gt; 01:22:53.779
I'm starting to sweat in places
you don't wanna hear about.

01:22:57.716 --&gt; 01:23:00.018
What the fuck?
Is that a cop car?

01:23:00.052 --&gt; 01:23:01.320
What if he sees me?

01:23:06.858 --&gt; 01:23:09.961
Oh, shit!
You sly motherfucker, you.

01:23:09.995 --&gt; 01:23:12.198
You got a pig
working for you, don't you?

01:23:12.231 --&gt; 01:23:14.133
That's how you get
the live ones.

01:23:14.166 --&gt; 01:23:16.502
Me and Chase,
the pick-up guy in Lancaster,

01:23:16.535 --&gt; 01:23:18.437
we was wondering about that.

01:23:18.470 --&gt; 01:23:22.608
Fuck, now I owe him 50 bucks.
I knew I smelled bacon.

01:23:22.641 --&gt; 01:23:24.343
So where is he?
Can I meet him?

01:23:24.376 --&gt; 01:23:25.811
Or her. I'm down
with either one.

01:23:25.844 --&gt; 01:23:27.313
We're all part of the
same team, right?

01:23:27.346 --&gt; 01:23:28.847
It's... What?

01:23:28.880 --&gt; 01:23:30.649
Ugh!

01:23:30.682 --&gt; 01:23:33.152
Gunshot.

01:23:33.185 --&gt; 01:23:35.821
Oh, God. Who's shooting who?

01:23:35.854 --&gt; 01:23:38.790
It doesn't matter. OK.

01:23:38.824 --&gt; 01:23:40.192
Come on.

01:23:41.593 --&gt; 01:23:43.162
Motherfucker!

01:23:45.030 --&gt; 01:23:46.298
What?

01:23:46.332 --&gt; 01:23:48.534
You just cost us $100,000.

01:23:48.567 --&gt; 01:23:50.035
He had a big mouth.

01:23:50.068 --&gt; 01:23:51.570
Shame we can't sell that.

01:23:51.603 --&gt; 01:23:53.272
We would have raised
a pretty penny.

01:24:04.716 --&gt; 01:24:06.118
Ow!

01:24:17.263 --&gt; 01:24:19.731
-TJ.
-What?

01:24:19.765 --&gt; 01:24:21.567
Over here.

01:24:27.139 --&gt; 01:24:29.074
-Move this?
-Yeah.

01:24:30.876 --&gt; 01:24:32.110
Shh!

01:24:32.144 --&gt; 01:24:33.912
Shh! Shh!

01:24:35.147 --&gt; 01:24:36.548
OK.

01:24:37.649 --&gt; 01:24:40.085
-Can we get through?
-Yeah, yeah, we can.

01:24:40.118 --&gt; 01:24:42.288
Shh! Shh!

01:24:42.321 --&gt; 01:24:43.889
OK.

01:24:56.968 --&gt; 01:24:59.771
-You OK?
-Yeah, there's just some pipe.

01:24:59.805 --&gt; 01:25:02.174
-Watch it.
-OK.

01:25:14.320 --&gt; 01:25:16.222
Shh, shh, shh.

01:25:24.630 --&gt; 01:25:27.633
You shot our contact.
You, Sheriff, have fucked us.

01:25:27.666 --&gt; 01:25:29.768
Not the way
I see it, partner.

01:25:29.801 --&gt; 01:25:32.671
This guy was shot
by some intruder.

01:25:32.704 --&gt; 01:25:34.640
The same punks
locked in the basement.

01:25:34.673 --&gt; 01:25:36.675
They killed him, not us.

01:25:36.708 --&gt; 01:25:38.844
Can't we just hand over
his liver?

01:25:46.485 --&gt; 01:25:49.855
I don't think they'll accept
a liver with buckshot, do you?

01:25:49.888 --&gt; 01:25:53.925
OK. How about the ones
you keep in reserve downstairs?

01:25:53.959 --&gt; 01:25:56.762
Spare parts
from drunks, junkies.

01:25:56.795 --&gt; 01:25:58.997
Kidneys are OK, eyes are good,

01:25:59.030 --&gt; 01:26:01.333
but livers are rotten.

01:26:02.334 --&gt; 01:26:03.902
How about yours?

01:26:05.704 --&gt; 01:26:07.105
Don't even joke.

01:26:07.138 --&gt; 01:26:09.040
You so much as raise
an eyebrow at me

01:26:09.074 --&gt; 01:26:11.677
and I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

01:26:14.079 --&gt; 01:26:16.147
And what story will you tell?

01:26:16.181 --&gt; 01:26:17.849
Any one I want.

01:26:17.883 --&gt; 01:26:21.887
I'll be a goddamn hero,
stopping the Calexico Butcher.

01:26:21.920 --&gt; 01:26:24.055
Might even get a parade.

01:26:26.592 --&gt; 01:26:28.727
Squirrelly SOB, ain't he?

01:26:36.902 --&gt; 01:26:38.370
I'll make the call.

01:26:38.404 --&gt; 01:26:40.539
I'll tell them there's
been a slight hiccup...

01:26:42.007 --&gt; 01:26:43.642
..but there's
a solution in play.

01:26:43.675 --&gt; 01:26:45.243
What about him?

01:26:45.277 --&gt; 01:26:46.912
Get the tear gas.

01:26:48.213 --&gt; 01:26:49.848
We need a liver.

01:27:03.895 --&gt; 01:27:06.765
I have the item
you requested on hand.

01:27:06.798 --&gt; 01:27:08.734
But you'll need a new courier.

01:27:08.767 --&gt; 01:27:11.102
Drive it yourself.

01:27:11.136 --&gt; 01:27:15.106
Transfer me an extra 50.
Your rush is not my problem.

01:27:23.148 --&gt; 01:27:24.950
I'm sorry, TJ.

01:27:24.983 --&gt; 01:27:26.084
No, no. He's gone.

01:27:31.256 --&gt; 01:27:34.593
Your man getting blindsided
is not my fault.

01:27:34.626 --&gt; 01:27:38.564
Misfortune is remedied
by ingenuity.

01:27:40.932 --&gt; 01:27:42.434
And money.

01:27:42.468 --&gt; 01:27:44.370
Deliver in two hours.

01:27:44.403 --&gt; 01:27:46.405
You'll have your extra.

01:27:46.438 --&gt; 01:27:47.973
Don't be late.

01:27:52.578 --&gt; 01:27:54.646
Rats in the walls.

01:28:16.435 --&gt; 01:28:18.470
Grab his legs.
Grab his legs.

01:28:21.039 --&gt; 01:28:23.509
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.
-Shh, shh, shh!

01:28:23.542 --&gt; 01:28:25.343
He's...he's bleeding
all over the place.

01:28:25.377 --&gt; 01:28:26.812
Who the hell
are you guys?

01:28:26.845 --&gt; 01:28:28.514
No-one. OK, OK, good.

01:28:28.547 --&gt; 01:28:30.148
Well, you just
saved my ass back there,

01:28:30.181 --&gt; 01:28:31.817
so that's got
to make you somebody.

01:28:31.850 --&gt; 01:28:33.585
OK,
this is gonna hurt.

01:28:33.619 --&gt; 01:28:36.788
-Sorry! Shh, shh, shh!

01:28:36.822 --&gt; 01:28:38.356
I'm sorry.

01:28:38.390 --&gt; 01:28:41.693
Get me the hell out of here, I
got 10 G's with your name on it.

01:28:41.727 --&gt; 01:28:44.095
-Make it 25.
-TJ.

01:28:44.129 --&gt; 01:28:45.664
Our enemy's enemy has money.

01:28:45.697 --&gt; 01:28:48.600
We need it, he needs us. Right?

01:28:48.634 --&gt; 01:28:50.168
I don't know. I can't think.

01:28:50.201 --&gt; 01:28:53.004
Done. But Mannix can't be dead.

01:28:55.306 --&gt; 01:28:56.808
The fuck?

01:28:58.410 --&gt; 01:28:59.711
Tear gas.

01:28:59.745 --&gt; 01:29:01.980
OK, uh, TJ?

01:29:02.013 --&gt; 01:29:03.815
I need you to focus, OK?
Focus. Get back...

01:29:13.559 --&gt; 01:29:15.861
OK, look at me.
OK, you need to put this on.

01:29:15.894 --&gt; 01:29:18.730
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Breathe. Breathe.

01:29:18.764 --&gt; 01:29:20.999
They're going to come
after me, OK?

01:29:21.032 --&gt; 01:29:22.734
You take him,
you go where it's safe

01:29:22.768 --&gt; 01:29:25.136
and then you wait and then
you get the fuckin' money.

01:29:25.170 --&gt; 01:29:27.038
-No, no. Wait, wait...
-Listen to him, OK?

01:29:27.072 --&gt; 01:29:29.307
I'm gonna be fine.
You go. Go, go, go, go.

01:29:29.340 --&gt; 01:29:30.742
OK, OK.

01:29:30.776 --&gt; 01:29:32.878
Go, go. There, under.

01:29:32.911 --&gt; 01:29:34.546
You follow him, OK?

01:29:37.683 --&gt; 01:29:39.117
Oh, fuck!

01:30:42.814 --&gt; 01:30:45.150
-Dammit!

01:30:45.183 --&gt; 01:30:46.652
God!

01:30:48.987 --&gt; 01:30:50.455
Alright.

01:30:51.923 --&gt; 01:30:53.424
OK.

01:31:17.683 --&gt; 01:31:19.985
-OK.

01:31:20.018 --&gt; 01:31:22.487
Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:31:23.989 --&gt; 01:31:25.090
Go, go.

01:31:25.123 --&gt; 01:31:27.225
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

01:32:09.100 --&gt; 01:32:10.769
I got her!

01:32:15.240 --&gt; 01:32:17.342
Nowhere to run, baby.

01:32:19.010 --&gt; 01:32:21.012
Drop the hammer.

01:32:23.782 --&gt; 01:32:25.250
Ugh!

01:33:24.275 --&gt; 01:33:25.643
Shit.

01:33:36.822 --&gt; 01:33:39.324
Your sister owes me a liver.

01:33:39.357 --&gt; 01:33:41.159
Yours will do.

01:33:57.542 --&gt; 01:33:59.144
Chloe?

01:33:59.177 --&gt; 01:34:02.347
You have completely
ruined my life.

01:34:03.715 --&gt; 01:34:05.450
I can explain a lot of things,

01:34:05.483 --&gt; 01:34:07.786
but a dead sheriff
is not one of them.

01:34:10.388 --&gt; 01:34:12.824
Looks like I'll have to move on.

01:34:15.060 --&gt; 01:34:17.428
But before I do,

01:34:17.462 --&gt; 01:34:19.330
you should know

01:34:19.364 --&gt; 01:34:22.200
that this pathetic life
of your brother's...

01:34:23.802 --&gt; 01:34:27.438
..will bring renewed life
to three, maybe even four

01:34:27.472 --&gt; 01:34:29.975
more worthy people.

01:34:31.409 --&gt; 01:34:34.012
And once he's donated
to the deserving...

01:34:49.427 --&gt; 01:34:51.162
..it will be your turn.

01:35:22.427 --&gt; 01:35:23.628
TJ?

01:35:25.230 --&gt; 01:35:27.866
TJ. Hey.

01:35:29.968 --&gt; 01:35:31.736
Hi. Hi.

01:35:31.769 --&gt; 01:35:33.704
It's gonna be OK, OK?

01:35:33.738 --&gt; 01:35:35.373
I got you.

01:35:35.406 --&gt; 01:35:37.876
-Behind you...
-What? What?

01:35:37.909 --&gt; 01:35:39.544
Behind you.

01:35:39.577 --&gt; 01:35:40.879
Hi.

01:35:45.817 --&gt; 01:35:48.019
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

01:35:48.053 --&gt; 01:35:49.587
An eye...

01:35:50.822 --&gt; 01:35:52.290
..for an eye.

01:35:53.992 --&gt; 01:35:56.394
No...

01:36:16.982 --&gt; 01:36:19.550
Oh, holy shit.

01:37:08.866 --&gt; 01:37:10.401
It's my turn now.

01:37:34.725 --&gt; 01:37:35.793
Huh!

01:37:35.826 --&gt; 01:37:38.029
Arggh! Arggh!

01:37:42.433 --&gt; 01:37:43.768
Take it!

01:37:56.948 --&gt; 01:37:59.250
You are the sickness.

01:38:00.551 --&gt; 01:38:02.353
I'm the cure.

01:39:16.194 --&gt; 01:39:17.462
I'm OK.

01:39:17.495 --&gt; 01:39:19.830
OK, w-w-we saved you, so...

01:39:19.864 --&gt; 01:39:22.333
..you know, you...

01:39:22.367 --&gt; 01:39:23.668
..you gotta pay.

01:39:23.701 --&gt; 01:39:26.771
I saved you back, so...

01:39:26.804 --&gt; 01:39:28.639
..seems like we're even.

01:39:30.675 --&gt; 01:39:32.177
That's bullshit.

01:39:35.780 --&gt; 01:39:37.115
I still need something.

01:39:38.116 --&gt; 01:39:39.684
You get it for me...

01:39:40.685 --&gt; 01:39:42.520
..I pay you in full.

01:39:52.630 --&gt; 01:39:53.798
God, I hate that damn dog.

01:39:53.831 --&gt; 01:39:56.033
Dr Death killed his reserves.

01:39:56.067 --&gt; 01:39:58.103
No loose ends, I guess.

01:39:58.136 --&gt; 01:40:01.172
Not that it matters now,
you arrogant fuck.

01:40:01.206 --&gt; 01:40:03.174
Mannix is a bad dude,

01:40:03.208 --&gt; 01:40:05.110
but that motherfucker,

01:40:05.143 --&gt; 01:40:08.045
he's gonna be the devil's bitch
for sure.

01:40:11.048 --&gt; 01:40:12.650
OK.

01:40:12.683 --&gt; 01:40:14.885
OK, she's done.

01:40:14.919 --&gt; 01:40:16.154
Pay up.

01:40:21.159 --&gt; 01:40:23.194
A deal's a deal, my man.

01:40:51.289 --&gt; 01:40:52.690
Nice shirt, man.

01:40:52.723 --&gt; 01:40:53.924
Huh!

01:40:53.958 --&gt; 01:40:56.227
Hey, you good?

01:40:56.261 --&gt; 01:40:57.895
Yeah, I'm better than ever.

01:41:01.199 --&gt; 01:41:02.933
You need a ride?

01:41:02.967 --&gt; 01:41:04.935
You need a doctor.

01:41:04.969 --&gt; 01:41:06.904
There's one where I'm going.

01:41:06.937 --&gt; 01:41:08.473
Close enough.

01:41:09.474 --&gt; 01:41:12.243
So can I drop
you two off or what?

01:41:16.046 --&gt; 01:41:17.282
Yeah.

01:41:17.315 --&gt; 01:41:19.784
-Alright.
-You can drop us off.

01:41:25.790 --&gt; 01:41:28.259
-Oh, hey, uh...

01:41:29.260 --&gt; 01:41:32.330
I almost forgot

01:41:39.804 --&gt; 01:41:42.006
-Ready to get outta here?
-Fuck, yeah.</text></body></html>
