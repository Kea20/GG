WEBVTT

1
00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.286
- Is that... oh, it's okay.
- You... it's just...

2
00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.121
Can we just-just like that?
Is that good?

3
00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.456
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah,
we can go slow.

4
00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.234
- You close?
- Um, I...

5
00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.236
I think I lost it.

6
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.272
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.474
- But do you want to...
- Stop? Yeah, no, we can stop.

8
00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:42.644
Oh, oh, great, yeah-yeah,
I have to go to work.

9
00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:44.111
- So, okay, all right.
- Yeah, no, that's okay.

10
00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.379
Good try.

11
00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:51.151
Do you wanna try again tonight?

12
00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.487
Maybe? I don't know,
I'm supposed to meet

13
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:55.122
with Doug later,
so I don't really know

14
00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.256
what kind of mood
I'm gonna be in.

15
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.592
Sorry, I always forget

16
00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:58.660
you have a parole officer.

17
00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:00.394
He's a probation officer.

18
00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.663
It's not a parole...
I didn't go to jail.

19
00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:03.297
That's the difference, I keep

20
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.165
explaining that,
and you don't...

21
00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.234
Do you wanna try this weekend?

22
00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.836
Maybe!

23
00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:34.662
Hi.

24
00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:36.396
My name's Jack Brown,
I was curious if I could

25
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.632
talk to you about
saving the planet today.

26
00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:39.333
Uh, no, no.

27
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.711
Oh, hi, did you want
a fitting room,

28
00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:51.244
or should I wrap it up for you?

29
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.647
- Just ring it up please.
- Okay.

30
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.549
Can you put me on the list?

31
00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:56.283
- Yeah, sure, of course.
- For, like,

32
00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.151
- not to come back?
- "Do not come back."

33
00:01:58.185 --> 00:01:59.854
I wanna... I wanna be
on the list that's like,

34
00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:02.422
never come here again
for you and your peers.

35
00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:05.492
I'll take this too.

36
00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:07.427
Oh, um, off the mannequin?

37
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.897
Just... I'll take it.

38
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:12.265
Okay.

39
00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.802
- Hey-yo!
- Hey, my name's Jack Brown.

40
00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:17.337
Yeah, you're from Titty Bingo.

41
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.706
Excuse me?

42
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.778
You know what?
Never mind.

43
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:25.580
Wait, no, what's...
What's Titty Bingo?

44
00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:27.815
Oh, that's from
the Spring Resort collection.

45
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:32.754
- Yes.
- Okay.

46
00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:37.859
Why?

47
00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:44.498
Oh, hey, welcome to the store...

48
00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:45.900
Just looking.

49
00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.584
Caught you!

50
00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:06.888
- Um...
- Where's that from?

51
00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.657
- Um, the... sorry?
- The wine.

52
00:03:09.691 --> 00:03:12.927
Oh, uh... the bottle?

53
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.729
You're fun.

54
00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.196
You're fun.
That's a fun answer.

55
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.735
Mm... mm!

56
00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:22.937
Ugh, who serves
room temperature rosé?

57
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.939
Ugh, my boss.

58
00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.309
That dress is good on you.

59
00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.845
Uh, it... it's not mine,

60
00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.279
we, you know,
we have to wear stuff

61
00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.881
from the store, so...

62
00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:36.416
I mean, I...

63
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.686
I would love to show you
something similar,

64
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.420
or you could even...
You could try this one on.

65
00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.422
Why'd you do that?

66
00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:44.659
Well, I work here, so.

67
00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:48.328
No, why'd you deflect
when I gave you a compliment?

68
00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.697
- Oh, I...
- Is that something

69
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:51.699
- you normally do?
- Um...

70
00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:53.901
You shouldn't do that.

71
00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:55.603
No, we would never talk
to anyone else

72
00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.270
the way we talk to ourselves.

73
00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:58.639
My friend Renée Brown says that.

74
00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:00.508
- Oh...
- Come with me.

75
00:04:02.744 --> 00:04:04.779
Oh, my God, you're so tall.

76
00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:08.381
- I know.
- No, it's amazing.

77
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.351
You're like a valkyrie
or an Amazonian.

78
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.353
You look like Wonder Woman.

79
00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.890
Look at you, you're so powerful.

80
00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:17.558
You look amazing, right?

81
00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.928
Say it.

82
00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:22.663
You look amazing.

83
00:04:22.697 --> 00:04:25.666
- Say it.
- No, it's... no.

84
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.769
- You look amazing.
- I...

85
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.905
"I look amazing."

86
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.707
Now you.

87
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.975
I look amazing.

88
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:35.676
Yeah, one more time.

89
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.045
- I look amazing.
- Okay, one more time.

90
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.480
- I look amazing.
- Now I believe you.

91
00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:44.519
We're just having fun.

92
00:04:44.552 --> 00:04:46.687
I love that. I'm Catherine.
People call me Cat.

93
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:48.689
I'm Lindsay.
People just...

94
00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:50.758
- Lindz?
- ...call me Lindsay.

95
00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:52.994
I'm gonna call you Lindz.

96
00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:54.729
You're about to go
on break, right?

97
00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:56.097
- Oh, I don't...
- I feel like

98
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.032
you're about to go on break.

99
00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.102
In the back of my mind,
I just, I've always wanted

100
00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.604
to be a designer,
and then I got...

101
00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:05.606
I don't know, here I am.

102
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.676
Working at a store,
and Jack is...

103
00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:10.410
I'm sorry,
I'm a little embarrassed,

104
00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:11.946
I'm just,
I'm rambling on and on.

105
00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.681
- No, no-no.
- I... we should...

106
00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.348
Let's just stop
talking about me.

107
00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:18.385
Lindz, honestly,

108
00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.087
I'm just happy to be
talking to another person

109
00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:22.089
- who's married.
- Oh, are your friends

110
00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:24.091
- not married?
- Well, I don't really...

111
00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:26.627
- have a lot of friends.
- Oh, my God.

112
00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:28.963
- I don't either.
- Well, who has time?

113
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.065
- Right?
- You know? Work, kids.

114
00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:32.967
- Blah.
- Oh, you have kids.

115
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.669
Twins.
You don't?

116
00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:36.704
Oh, no, no.

117
00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:38.906
No twins, no kids, um,

118
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.875
we, you know,
we talked about it,

119
00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:42.944
and it's not like
we're not... not trying,

120
00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:44.745
we're just not trying,

121
00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.147
- you know?
- Well, good for you.

122
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.015
We need more wine.

123
00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:49.717
- What's her name?
- Um, Georgia?

124
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.152
Georgia!

125
00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:52.887
- Hey, Georgia!
- Oh, God.

126
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.655
Yeah, you.

127
00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:58.458
Is there something
I can help you with?

128
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.393
My friend Lindz is
entertaining me,

129
00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:02.129
and we would just
love another bottle

130
00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:03.564
of that delicious rosé
you're pouring.

131
00:06:03.598 --> 00:06:05.766
Oh, Lindz, is it now?

132
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.668
Well, Lindz,
if your friend isn't

133
00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:09.036
going to buy anything,
I'm going to have to ask her

134
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.105
- to leave.
- Is she talking to me?

135
00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:13.608
- Yes, I am.
- I'm sorry.

136
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.111
- You're going to leave.
- Oh, okay.

137
00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:19.013
I... okay, I think she's mad.

138
00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:21.515
Um, Lindz,
you get commission, right?

139
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:24.685
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great, okay.

140
00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.755
Georgia? I'm gonna
take care of this.

141
00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.624
Have you ever thought
about meditating?

142
00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:32.727
So, then Cat points
to an entire rack and says,

143
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.595
"I'll take all of that
in a size two."

144
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:35.963
Points to another rack and says,

145
00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:37.732
"I'll take all of that
in a size four,"

146
00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:39.533
because she gains weight
when they go to France.

147
00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.202
And then she says,
"I'll take all of the boots

148
00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:43.871
in a seven, and then
whatever Lindz likes."

149
00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:46.107
- Ooh, "Lindz."
- Yeah, whatever Lindz likes.

150
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.975
You fucking hate
when people call you Lindz.

151
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.177
What? No, I... sorry,
what was I saying?

152
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:52.213
You just threw me off track.

153
00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:55.049
Uh, boots and then
whatever Lindz likes.

154
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.752
Yes, whatever Lindz likes
from the jewelry.

155
00:06:57.785 --> 00:06:59.654
"You know what, actually
I'm just gonna take

156
00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:01.222
- all of the jewelry."
- Oh, fuck.

157
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.791
Yeah! "And I want it
hand-wrapped,

158
00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:05.960
individually, by you."

159
00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:09.130
- She said that to Georgia?
- To Georgia.

160
00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:11.198
- And you're not fired?
- No!

161
00:07:11.232 --> 00:07:12.967
I sold more in ten minutes

162
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.669
than that boutique has
sold in six months.

163
00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:17.538
- Nice.
- Then she takes my phone,

164
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.806
she puts her number in it,

165
00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.708
and says, "You and Jack

166
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:22.610
"have to go to Sonoma
next weekend

167
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:27.480
Yeah, Cat says
it's the new Napa.

168
00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:31.552
Did you hear what I just said?

169
00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:34.155
What? Yeah,
no, yeah, it's wild.

170
00:07:34.188 --> 00:07:36.724
Do we not get
the MLB network anymore?

171
00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:38.793
Do you wanna go?

172
00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:40.728
- What?
- Do you wanna go?

173
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:42.596
- What, to Napa?
- Sonoma?

174
00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:47.201
- Jack.
- Bottom of the third...

175
00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.736
I mean, don't you think
that's kind of weird?

176
00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:51.172
Uh, no.
Do not cross-examine.

177
00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:53.808
I'm not, I just...
You don't know this Kate.

178
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.810
- Cat.
- Right, but this person

179
00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:57.244
just, like, blows
into your store, apparently

180
00:07:57.278 --> 00:07:59.046
buys everything in it,
and then you get

181
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.848
a huge commission... which,
like, you know, awesome.

182
00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:02.283
And then she just
invites you to Sedona?

183
00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:03.551
- Sonoma.
- What did I say?

184
00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:05.152
Sedona.

185
00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:06.988
My point being,
you know, this could be

186
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:08.990
some weird,
rich person sex thing

187
00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:10.891
- or, like, purge thing.
- "Purge"?

188
00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:12.793
Yeah, like the movies,
like... like maybe

189
00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:14.295
they wanna hunt us for sport,
did you think about that?

190
00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:16.664
No, I didn't, Jack,
because I'm not an idiot.

191
00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.833
Nice, nice, that's good.

192
00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:22.903
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:30.878
I would really like to go.

194
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.216
And I would like
to understand why you want

195
00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:37.318
to spend a weekend
with people you don't know.

196
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.687
Okay, because she was fun

197
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.689
and funny and interesting,

198
00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:44.658
and she and her husband own
their own businesses.

199
00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:46.193
And they have a house
and they have a family.

200
00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:48.129
They have their shit together.

201
00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:52.299
I thought this could be
really good for us.

202
00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.904
All right, when is it?

203
00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:58.572
- Next weekend.
- Next weekend!

204
00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.274
It's next weekend.
You said that, sorry.

205
00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:08.149
Okay.

206
00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:10.284
- Really?
- Yeah.

207
00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:12.787
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I gotta get the time off

208
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.855
and then clear it with Doug.

209
00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:17.725
But...

210
00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.860
- yeah, it'll be fun.
- Yeah?

211
00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:21.762
- I think.
- Yeah?

212
00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:23.998
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

213
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.666
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:27.068
- Okay.
- Okay.

215
00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:28.702
- I'm gonna text her.
- Great.

216
00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:30.337
- Okay.
- If they purge us, though,

217
00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:31.972
I get to be super-pissed off.

218
00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:33.374
I mean, it could be
the sex thing.

219
00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:34.608
No.

220
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.350
I knew we should've
printed the directions.

221
00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:45.052
Well, I mean, I didn't know
that there would be

222
00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:47.254
- no service.
- This is what rich people do.

223
00:09:47.288 --> 00:09:48.956
They go off the grid
for vacation.

224
00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:50.791
Because you know
so many rich people?

225
00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:52.359
No, but I do watch "Billions,"

226
00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:54.862
and this is... this is
a total Axe move.

227
00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:56.363
Okay.

228
00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.700
Where the fuck are we?

229
00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:01.902
- We're in wine country.
- So why are there cows?

230
00:10:01.936 --> 00:10:04.105
There should be grapes.
Read the invite again?

231
00:10:04.138 --> 00:10:06.006
"You are cordially
invited to a weekend

232
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.175
"of wine and whimsy
at Vlas Vineyard.

233
00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:11.045
7766 Lewis Road."

234
00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:12.947
Oh, my God.

235
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.783
And there's a star
and a picture of a cow.

236
00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:17.184
So we are clearly close.

237
00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:30.698
- That's a murder house.
- What?

238
00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:33.134
Yeah. That's a house
where a murder happens.

239
00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:35.302
- What are you talking about?
- My mom always said

240
00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:36.904
you would kill me,
and you've finally done it.

241
00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:39.874
- This is great.
- All right, "Purge."

242
00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:42.276
Look, they're obviously

243
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:44.311
very, very wealthy.

244
00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:45.846
You're gonna have to call them.

245
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.381
- I...
- We're just gonna

246
00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:50.017
sit here like weirdos.

247
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.687
Hi! It's Jack and Lindsay!

248
00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:16.143
- No, Jack!
- Hello?

249
00:11:16.177 --> 00:11:17.244
Don't be rude!

250
00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:19.079
Hello?

251
00:11:38.332 --> 00:11:40.267
This man is made of dicks.

252
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:41.936
- Jack!
- What? He'...

253
00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:43.404
No, I need you to be cool, okay?

254
00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:45.172
- I am, I am cool.
- No, listen to me.

255
00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:47.274
I really like her,
and she's being really nice

256
00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:49.043
to invite us up here,
and I'm not really great

257
00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.512
at making friends,
so I just need you to...

258
00:11:50.545 --> 00:11:52.813
- No, I will keep it tight.
- Tightest.

259
00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:07.094
Okay.

260
00:12:11.298 --> 00:12:13.267
Oh!

261
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.537
Let's get
the birthday weekend started!

262
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.371
Let's do it!

263
00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.306
- Hey!
- Hi.

264
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.041
- You made it!
- Hi!

265
00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:22.476
Hey, can we get Jack
and Lindsay some drinks?

266
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.079
- Hi.
- Hi.

267
00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:27.248
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

268
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:28.983
Did you get
the champagne? Great.

269
00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:31.485
I am so grateful you're here.

270
00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.487
I have been losing my mind.

271
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:35.422
Jack, it is so nice
to finally meet you.

272
00:12:35.456 --> 00:12:37.825
You are so lucky to have her.

273
00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:40.294
- She's so special.
- Oh, yeah, no, thank you.

274
00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.329
- Yeah, of course.
- Jack and Lindz,

275
00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:44.566
these are our friends
Kerry and Carrie.

276
00:12:44.599 --> 00:12:46.800
We know.
It's okay to laugh.

277
00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:48.369
I didn't know his name was
Kerry when we met.

278
00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:50.237
Yeah, she was modeling
at this world wildlife

279
00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:52.439
fundraiser-fashion show-
interactive theater

280
00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:54.074
sort of thing
that Jared was doing.

281
00:12:54.108 --> 00:12:56.043
- Leto, not Kushner.
- Yeah, of course.

282
00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:57.545
That Jared was doing at Dumbo...

283
00:12:57.579 --> 00:12:59.313
We were all playing
the emotions of penguins

284
00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:01.215
that were killed
for their scales.

285
00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:03.150
Right, right, and the girls
were only allowed to show

286
00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:04.852
- what emotion they were.
- Sad.

287
00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:06.554
Which was super-convincing,
'cause I thought

288
00:13:06.588 --> 00:13:08.222
- her name was...
- Sad.

289
00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.090
...For, like, a week.

290
00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:11.593
But, in my defense, I was
pretty fuckin' banged up.

291
00:13:11.626 --> 00:13:15.095
He spent $65,000

292
00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:16.830
- on champagne.
- Yeah, and then we did

293
00:13:16.864 --> 00:13:18.399
a couple of grams
of Bolivian marching powder

294
00:13:18.432 --> 00:13:20.200
- in the bathroom.
- And we tried to have sex.

295
00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:21.503
In the bathroom.

296
00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:22.970
But he couldn't get hard.

297
00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:24.371
Because of the blow.

298
00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:27.174
And we've been together

299
00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:29.143
- pretty much ever since.
- Ahh!

300
00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:31.145
Classic Kerry, right, babe?

301
00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:32.980
Can I steal her for a sec?

302
00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:34.315
Oh, yeah, by all means.

303
00:13:34.348 --> 00:13:35.983
Great.

304
00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.418
I've heard that story
a million times.

305
00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:40.154
You're welcome.

306
00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:41.922
- My man.
- Yeah.

307
00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:43.490
- Matt Flax.
- Jack Brown.

308
00:13:43.525 --> 00:13:44.958
- Pleasure there, bud.
- Good to meet you.

309
00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:46.226
Nice to meet you too.
Thank you.

310
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.095
Yeah, no, my...
this is...

311
00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:49.631
hey, can I... do you mind?

312
00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:51.131
Oh, yeah, that's great,
thank you, Becca.

313
00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:52.399
Thank you, Becca.

314
00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:53.901
- Hi.
- Hi.

315
00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.336
God, I hate those people.

316
00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:58.339
Really?
They seem nice.

317
00:13:58.372 --> 00:13:59.973
Oh, they're not.

318
00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:01.308
- They're such assholes.
- Really?

319
00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:05.079
Yes.
So, how's Jack doing?

320
00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:06.447
He thinks we're crazy, right?

321
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.148
What? No.

322
00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:12.252
I mean... he thinks
you're gonna murder us.

323
00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:16.591
I mean, he's... he's joking.

324
00:14:16.624 --> 00:14:18.626
Oh, my God, no,
I totally get it.

325
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.361
I'm just, like,
this crazy stranger

326
00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:22.129
who stumbles into your store

327
00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:23.665
and then invites you
to Healdsburg.

328
00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:26.133
Who does that?

329
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.603
Actually, that would make
a really good horror movie.

330
00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:31.271
Should we write that?

331
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.107
I love that idea.

332
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.143
I'm sorry, I thought
we were in Sonoma.

333
00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:39.179
Oh, we are,
but it's actually Healdsburg,

334
00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:41.415
technically Windsor, but it's
all in the Sonoma region.

335
00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:43.450
Oh, okay.

336
00:14:43.484 --> 00:14:45.587
You know what?
Um, Jack and I were talking,

337
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.988
on the way up,
and we were thinking...

338
00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:51.225
I just felt an immediate
connection to you.

339
00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:54.261
You seem so...

340
00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:56.463
Sad?

341
00:14:56.497 --> 00:14:58.666
That's a good callback.

342
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.604
No, just... undervalued.

343
00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:04.104
You're not supposed
to be selling

344
00:15:04.138 --> 00:15:06.073
other people's clothes.

345
00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:10.244
Well, I... I mean,
I don't want to be.

346
00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.479
Then why are you?

347
00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:16.350
Student debt.

348
00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:21.221
Oh.

349
00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:22.657
You enjoying the brew?

350
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.028
You... holy shit, you can't...
You can't get this

351
00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.063
- in California.
- Pause.

352
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:32.232
You buy the distributor,
you can do whatever you want.

353
00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:34.034
You buy the...

354
00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:36.236
- You bought the distributor?
- Anyway,

355
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.639
let me tell you
a quick story, so that

356
00:15:37.672 --> 00:15:40.240
you don't have to hear it
from Kerry later.

357
00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:42.677
His grandfather
invented tater tots.

358
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.679
- Get the fuck out of here.
- No, it's an epic story.

359
00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:46.447
He was working KP,
kitchen duty, in World War II,

360
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.081
not in the shit,
he was in, like,

361
00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:49.483
Mississippi or something,
and there were

362
00:15:49.517 --> 00:15:51.285
all these little
extra pieces of potato

363
00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:53.086
that they weren't using,
so the guys in the kitchen

364
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.657
started frying 'em up,
and the grunts loved 'em.

365
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.992
So the war ends, and this guy
has got the foresight

366
00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:00.461
to trademark the thing...

367
00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:03.263
The rest of the KP guys
were pissed.

368
00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:04.766
Wait, he didn't cut 'em in?

369
00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:06.701
No, man, the guy was
a fuckin' killer.

370
00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:08.636
- You know?
- Yeah.

371
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.405
Killer. Killer instinct.

372
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:15.743
Wow.

373
00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:20.682
Uh, so...
how many more people are

374
00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:22.617
- coming up this weekend?
- Oh, this is it.

375
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.384
Cat wanted to keep it pretty
intimate for her birthday.

376
00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:26.353
And we were gonna
blow it out for 30, so...

377
00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:28.422
she wanted to keep it
simple for 29.

378
00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:31.225
- It's Cat's birthday?
- What... 69?!

379
00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:33.795
- My guy!
- It's her birthday?

380
00:16:33.828 --> 00:16:35.763
I feel like
I might know the waiter.

381
00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:37.732
- Mm, which one?
- The guy.

382
00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:39.433
Daniel?

383
00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:41.536
- Daniel...
- Yeah.

384
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:43.771
Huh.

385
00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:45.472
- Uh...
- Do you know him?

386
00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:46.808
- Where are the twins?
- Oh, they're back

387
00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:48.442
with the au pair in the city.

388
00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:49.677
We wanted to get away
this weekend.

389
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:51.245
Oh, hell yeah, good for you.

390
00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:52.780
Yeah, it's my birthday.

391
00:16:52.814 --> 00:16:54.314
I didn't want to think about it.

392
00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:55.683
Them... they're obvious...

393
00:16:55.717 --> 00:16:57.284
They're people, I love them.

394
00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:58.686
Did you just say
it was your birthday?

395
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.221
- Yeah.
- Your birthday?!

396
00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:02.657
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

397
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.526
I didn't bring anything!

398
00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:06.460
- Oh, that's okay.
- No, I'm so sorry.

399
00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:10.097
Trust me,
you being here is enough.

400
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.432
I really want you
to let me cook you dinner.

401
00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:14.536
- Oh... ew, no!
- Please.

402
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.169
- No?
- Ew, no-no-no.

403
00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:18.105
We have...
We have people who do that.

404
00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:19.607
You just be our guest.

405
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:21.275
Just relax, enjoy.

406
00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:23.176
- Okay.
- Yeah.

407
00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:25.747
I'm just happy you're here.

408
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.649
- Mmm.
- Hey.

409
00:17:27.682 --> 00:17:29.751
Hi.

410
00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:31.251
- Hi.
- Hi.

411
00:17:31.285 --> 00:17:33.086
You know... hi, I think

412
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.622
Lindsay and I would love
to take a moment

413
00:17:34.656 --> 00:17:36.356
to just go check out
our room real quick.

414
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.159
- Just get situated.
- Oh...

415
00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:41.128
yeah, I'm... I'm so sorry.

416
00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:44.398
I... I forget that being
up here makes people...

417
00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:46.199
- Oh...
- Oh, no-no-no...

418
00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:48.201
You two go unload.

419
00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:51.171
Wink-wink, sorry,
I'm... I'm so inappropriate.

420
00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:53.641
Sometimes I have to... Becca!

421
00:17:57.712 --> 00:17:59.446
Could you please show
our guests to their room?

422
00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:00.782
- Hi.
- Of course.

423
00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.617
We took the liberty of putting

424
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.786
- your bags in your room.
- I'm just gonna assume

425
00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:06.654
it's that one there at the end
of the hallway, right?

426
00:18:06.688 --> 00:18:08.355
So I think we can probably
get there on our own.

427
00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:10.457
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

428
00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:16.531
Holy shit, this is a guest room?

429
00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.468
He bought my favorite brewery.

430
00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.605
- What?
- He bought...

431
00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:25.472
well, he bought
the distribution...

432
00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:27.341
How did he know
that's my favorite beer?

433
00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.242
Oh, I mean, I don't know,
he probably, like,

434
00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:30.778
Instagram med you
or Face booked you,

435
00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:32.680
- or whatever.
- So he stalked me?

436
00:18:32.714 --> 00:18:34.682
No, he Googled you.

437
00:18:34.716 --> 00:18:36.416
We all do it.
We all Google each other,

438
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.151
and then we act surprised
when people tell us shit

439
00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:39.921
that we already know
about ourselves.

440
00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:41.556
Did you know
it was her birthday?

441
00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:44.291
- Mm...
- That's kind of weird

442
00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:45.793
she wouldn't tell us
that we were up here

443
00:18:45.827 --> 00:18:47.294
- for her birthday.
- Well, I think that...

444
00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:49.496
Where are our bags?

445
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.933
Um...

446
00:18:51.966 --> 00:18:54.769
they're in here, in a closet.

447
00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:56.938
- Jesus.
- They're unpacked.

448
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.206
They are definitely
gonna kill us.

449
00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:02.309
Hey, what are these?

450
00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:04.746
I don't know.

451
00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:09.316
Gift bags!

452
00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:11.485
Oh, my God!

453
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.490
- Jesus.
- Jack, these are so nice!

454
00:19:16.524 --> 00:19:18.593
I've got face wash...

455
00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:21.261
- Hangover kit...
- Beard trim lotion...

456
00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:23.865
- Massage oil...
- I have lube...

457
00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:25.600
- Really?
- Yes, there's, like,

458
00:19:25.633 --> 00:19:27.200
a tremendous amount
of sex stuff in here.

459
00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:29.971
- Oh, my God.
- And I have Viagra.

460
00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:33.675
I told you it was a sex thing.

461
00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:36.343
Yes, yes, you did.

462
00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:37.712
Gum...

463
00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:41.281
Hey.

464
00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:44.451
Can... Can we not do
any drugs this weekend?

465
00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:45.887
- Who's doing drugs?
- I mean, the first thing

466
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.354
- that guy said was...
- Which guy?

467
00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:48.756
Kerry, the tall guy.

468
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.957
He said he does a lot of blow.

469
00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:51.659
- Okay?
- And there are

470
00:19:51.693 --> 00:19:53.628
joints in my bag.

471
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:55.997
- Which are totally legal.
- They are, for people

472
00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.699
that aren't on probation
and have to piss

473
00:19:57.732 --> 00:19:59.299
- in a cup every week.
- Well, I mean...

474
00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:00.868
well, that's not their fault.

475
00:20:03.671 --> 00:20:05.372
Okay.

476
00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:12.446
There are six people here.

477
00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:14.381
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm,

478
00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:17.384
- and there's an itinerary.
- Wine tasting, karaoke,

479
00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:20.788
brunch, yoga, massages!

480
00:20:20.822 --> 00:20:22.824
Jack, this is like a resort.

481
00:20:22.857 --> 00:20:24.726
"Jumpin' Jack Flash."

482
00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:27.528
What?
That's so rad.

483
00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:30.832
What's mine say?

484
00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:33.266
"Lazy Lindz."

485
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.937
Oh, well...

486
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.271
You still hate when people
call you "Lindz," right?

487
00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.640
- Oh, yeah.
- They...

488
00:20:39.674 --> 00:20:41.542
- Don't know that.
- Right.

489
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.882
You wanna...

490
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.751
unload?

491
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:52.486
Now?

492
00:20:54.822 --> 00:20:57.424
You don't really seem
like you want to.

493
00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:01.294
Yeah, I don't.

494
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.472
Fuck, I should've changed.

495
00:21:12.507 --> 00:21:13.941
- No, you look fine.
- I look fucking homeless.

496
00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.676
- You look fine.
- Jack, Lindz,

497
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.612
- you guys get situated?
- Yeah, yeah.

498
00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.547
Somebody unpacked our stuff.

499
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.314
Oh, yeah, that was Milton.

500
00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:22.850
He is the fucking best.

501
00:21:22.884 --> 00:21:25.086
- Milton?
- Well,

502
00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:27.021
I say Milton,
I mean Daniel and Becca.

503
00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:29.389
- But yeah.
- Okay, you know,

504
00:21:29.422 --> 00:21:30.958
by the way, thank you
for the bags.

505
00:21:30.992 --> 00:21:32.760
- They're incredible.
- Oh, did we do bags?

506
00:21:32.794 --> 00:21:34.327
Hey, babe, what's in the bags?

507
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:35.963
I don't know,
I told Milton to do

508
00:21:35.997 --> 00:21:37.430
the kits again and then
just to do something

509
00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.868
- comfy but fun.
- Guys, seriously.

510
00:21:40.902 --> 00:21:43.436
Are they comfy but fun?

511
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.439
- Very.
- Great.

512
00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.341
Hey, I was...
I'm still not getting

513
00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:49.710
any cell phone reception.

514
00:21:49.744 --> 00:21:51.478
- Yeah, and you won't.
- What?

515
00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:52.947
No internet either.

516
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.549
Only way I can
keep him off the grid.

517
00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:56.517
She calls it a digital detox.

518
00:21:56.551 --> 00:21:58.119
We just get to be
here, together,

519
00:21:58.152 --> 00:21:59.954
without any interruptions.

520
00:21:59.987 --> 00:22:02.857
Wow, that's... that's crazy.

521
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.827
So, what are we doing
for dinner?

522
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.529
I'm... I'm happy
to help in the kitchen

523
00:22:08.563 --> 00:22:10.531
- with the vegan...
- Oh, no-no-no.

524
00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:12.066
Come here, I wanna show you
something, Ker, come here.

525
00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:13.568
You boys go away,
I want Lindz to myself.

526
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:14.802
- Okay.
- Come here.

527
00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:16.904
You have fun.

528
00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:18.673
- Jack?
- Yeah.

529
00:22:18.706 --> 00:22:20.373
What are you drinking?

530
00:22:20.407 --> 00:22:21.943
Just whatever you got
there is perfect.

531
00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:23.711
- Thank you.
- Tequila.

532
00:22:23.744 --> 00:22:26.681
- Oh.
- Bing.

533
00:22:26.714 --> 00:22:28.716
Bang.

534
00:22:28.749 --> 00:22:31.152
- Bong.
- Boom.

535
00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:33.486
- Cheers.
- Cheers, yes, thanks, guys.

536
00:22:36.724 --> 00:22:39.392
- Fuck me, that's good.
- Right? Yeah?

537
00:22:39.426 --> 00:22:40.928
What... is this...
Is this Casa? What is this?

538
00:22:40.962 --> 00:22:42.897
It's from me and Matt's
place in Jalisco.

539
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.899
- Jalisco?
- Yeah,

540
00:22:44.932 --> 00:22:47.367
the tequila capital
of the world, Jack.

541
00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:50.538
- Is this your tequila?
- Well, mine and Ker's,

542
00:22:50.571 --> 00:22:52.974
- but yeah.
- Oh, my God, that is cool.

543
00:22:53.007 --> 00:22:54.675
Yeah, we don't sell it, though.

544
00:22:54.709 --> 00:22:56.510
Yeah, it's just
for personal consumption.

545
00:22:56.544 --> 00:22:58.079
Mm-hmm, do you love it?
Or do you love it?

546
00:22:58.112 --> 00:22:59.446
- You love it.
- Kerry?

547
00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:00.815
- Yes?
- I fucking love

548
00:23:00.848 --> 00:23:02.683
- this tequila.
- I knew it.

549
00:23:02.717 --> 00:23:04.952
We'll have...
We'll send you a case, huh?

550
00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:06.787
Thank you, man, that's
really... that's really sweet.

551
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:08.155
Thank you. That's really
nice of you guys.

552
00:23:08.189 --> 00:23:09.924
Of course.
Hey, come on.

553
00:23:09.957 --> 00:23:11.559
- I wanna show you the view.
- Yeah-yeah-yeah.

554
00:23:11.592 --> 00:23:13.694
Hey, actually, you gotta
finish your drink.

555
00:23:13.728 --> 00:23:16.931
No man refills
till every man is refueled.

556
00:23:16.964 --> 00:23:19.200
- It's a house rule.
- I told my wife I wasn't

557
00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:20.935
gonna drink too much,
so I'm probably just gonna,

558
00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:22.536
like, I'll just sip it
a little bit, maybe,

559
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.804
like a water in there,
maybe a juice...

560
00:23:23.838 --> 00:23:25.006
How are you gonna
drink too much?

561
00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:26.507
We're not going anywhere.

562
00:23:28.509 --> 00:23:29.877
- Bottoms up!
- Okay, okay.

563
00:23:31.913 --> 00:23:34.181
- I'm too... let's go.
- It's really nice, though.

564
00:23:34.215 --> 00:23:36.117
It's kind of oaky.

565
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.785
Becca had our chef
prep everything

566
00:23:37.818 --> 00:23:39.820
and then run it up here
this morning.

567
00:23:39.854 --> 00:23:41.155
Don't tell anyone.

568
00:23:41.188 --> 00:23:43.490
- No.
- Wine?

569
00:23:43.524 --> 00:23:45.192
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

570
00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:47.528
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

571
00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:48.930
You're welcome.

572
00:23:48.963 --> 00:23:50.564
These are beautiful glasses.

573
00:23:50.598 --> 00:23:52.733
Oh, thank you.

574
00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:54.769
Yeah, they're kind of
one of a kind.

575
00:23:56.771 --> 00:24:00.741
Um... whoo.

576
00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:06.714
Okay, and...

577
00:24:06.747 --> 00:24:09.750
here you go...

578
00:24:09.784 --> 00:24:13.721
Ooh, sorry,
it's just about out, so.

579
00:24:13.754 --> 00:24:15.589
- That's fine.
- Awesome, okay.

580
00:24:19.226 --> 00:24:21.929
Um...

581
00:24:21.963 --> 00:24:24.231
I mean, I can't even imagine
having to do another trip

582
00:24:24.265 --> 00:24:26.000
with just the four of us.

583
00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:27.668
I mean, the boys are
inseparable.

584
00:24:27.702 --> 00:24:29.570
And then it's just me and...

585
00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:33.274
I mean,

586
00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:35.776
I just get drunk.
There's nothing else to do.

587
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.812
- Well, cheers.
- Thank you, God...

588
00:24:37.845 --> 00:24:39.847
It's the fucking best, right?

589
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.822
I can't believe
you're here, Jack.

590
00:24:47.855 --> 00:24:49.657
I can't believe it either, man.

591
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.092
Oh, no-no, no,
you misunderstand me.

592
00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:54.028
Cat doesn't like people.

593
00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:57.765
Not certain people.
People. I thought

594
00:24:57.798 --> 00:24:59.834
she was joking when she said
she invited you up here.

595
00:24:59.867 --> 00:25:02.236
Honestly, dude, I...
I thought Lindsay was...

596
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:03.971
Like, I still...
I still think this is a joke.

597
00:25:04.005 --> 00:25:05.606
I'm, like, waiting
for fucking Ashton Kutcher

598
00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:07.675
to pop out of the couch
or something.

599
00:25:07.708 --> 00:25:10.678
- Dude, is Ashton coming?
- He's just joking, Kerry.

600
00:25:10.711 --> 00:25:12.546
Wait, you guys know
Ashton Kutcher?

601
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.981
- Fuck, we used to...
- They had a big...

602
00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:15.916
- It doesn't matter.
- ...thing.

603
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.585
What, were you guys, like,
the house rules thing...

604
00:25:17.618 --> 00:25:19.286
- Were you guys in a frat...
- No, we went

605
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.622
- to a prep school together.
- Yeah, go, Cavs, whoo!

606
00:25:21.655 --> 00:25:24.291
And I was a first-gen,
and Kerry was not

607
00:25:24.325 --> 00:25:27.028
an old-money dick bag
like the rest of those guys.

608
00:25:27.061 --> 00:25:29.130
So you got a lot of these guys
coming to these schools

609
00:25:29.163 --> 00:25:30.931
who are, like, deep old money.

610
00:25:30.965 --> 00:25:32.833
Like, fucked up
industrial revolution money.

611
00:25:32.867 --> 00:25:34.668
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

612
00:25:34.702 --> 00:25:36.070
Matt was one of the first
hedge fund guy's kids

613
00:25:36.103 --> 00:25:37.605
- to roll through.
- Mm.

614
00:25:37.638 --> 00:25:39.106
Your dad was a hedge fund guy?

615
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.909
Yeah, yeah, he was.

616
00:25:41.942 --> 00:25:44.111
And then he was
an insider trading guy.

617
00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:46.180
- And then he was a jail guy.
- Whoa.

618
00:25:46.213 --> 00:25:48.582
And we lost everything,
and my mother had to...

619
00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:50.985
go back to waiting tables
at age 45

620
00:25:51.018 --> 00:25:52.987
at a shitty restaurant,

621
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.855
and I had to drop out
of school and take a job

622
00:25:54.889 --> 00:25:57.324
bagging groceries,
and then kind of

623
00:25:57.358 --> 00:26:00.127
the cherry on top of it all...

624
00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:02.196
my dad killed himself
when he was in prison.

625
00:26:02.229 --> 00:26:04.265
Oh, Jesus Christ,
man, I'm sorry.

626
00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:05.966
And it kind of
ruined my mom, and...

627
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.235
she couldn't work
anymore, and...

628
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:10.104
so I decided
to start working nights

629
00:26:10.137 --> 00:26:13.274
at Blockbuster, and...
when I was there,

630
00:26:13.307 --> 00:26:16.877
I pretty quickly identified
that their whole market share

631
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:19.146
was just gonna crumble
with the way that the internet

632
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.681
was gonna be going
with streaming services.

633
00:26:20.714 --> 00:26:22.683
- You were how old?
- Oh, was...

634
00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:24.085
- Seventeen.
- Yeah, 17,

635
00:26:24.118 --> 00:26:25.352
but it wasn't
rocket science, right?

636
00:26:25.386 --> 00:26:27.021
Everybody had big screen TVs,

637
00:26:27.054 --> 00:26:28.889
because the Korean tech
finally caught up

638
00:26:28.923 --> 00:26:31.759
to the need or want
of Japanese TVs.

639
00:26:31.792 --> 00:26:33.794
Thanks to an investment
from my guy here

640
00:26:33.828 --> 00:26:35.329
and some money over at Netflix,

641
00:26:35.362 --> 00:26:38.299
and a few other
well-placed investments...

642
00:26:38.332 --> 00:26:40.901
here we are.

643
00:26:40.935 --> 00:26:43.304
You did this by yourself?

644
00:26:43.337 --> 00:26:45.739
What? No.

645
00:26:45.773 --> 00:26:47.641
Did you listen
to anything I just said?

646
00:26:47.675 --> 00:26:50.377
My life is a Rube Goldberg
machine of privilege.

647
00:26:50.411 --> 00:26:52.646
It was, like...

648
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.950
...boarding school, bing,
university, boom,

649
00:26:55.983 --> 00:26:58.185
investment, no, man, come on.

650
00:26:58.219 --> 00:27:00.654
No, you don't... you don't
get this by yourself.

651
00:27:00.688 --> 00:27:02.389
You... You get this
with a little bit of capital

652
00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:04.792
and a fuck ton of luck.

653
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.095
- Hey, to luck.
- To luck.

654
00:27:08.129 --> 00:27:09.330
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

655
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:15.202
It is so nice to have
another adult to talk to.

656
00:27:15.236 --> 00:27:17.238
I mean, Kerry just runs
through these girls.

657
00:27:17.271 --> 00:27:19.974
This one's clearly nearing
her expiration date.

658
00:27:20.007 --> 00:27:22.176
And they've obviously
stopped fucking, right?

659
00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:24.378
How... How can you tell?

660
00:27:24.411 --> 00:27:26.714
Stop!

661
00:27:26.747 --> 00:27:28.983
"How can you tell?"

662
00:27:29.016 --> 00:27:30.684
Ugh, you're hilarious.

663
00:27:30.718 --> 00:27:32.186
Do you ever do stand-up?

664
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:34.455
- No.
- Really? You should.

665
00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:36.223
You could be, like,
Sarah Silver man's

666
00:27:36.257 --> 00:27:37.925
little sister.

667
00:27:37.958 --> 00:27:40.261
Oh! Time to rotate
the mung bean balls.

668
00:27:40.294 --> 00:27:43.330
- Becca!
- Thank you, Becca.

669
00:27:43.364 --> 00:27:44.865
You're so cute.

670
00:27:46.267 --> 00:27:48.068
No, no, no!

671
00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:53.407
So, what business are
you in, Jack?

672
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.443
Oh, I'm a... it's boring,
it's renewable energy.

673
00:27:56.477 --> 00:27:58.746
Oh, dope!
Dope, so, like,

674
00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:01.148
- design or infrastructure?
- No, it's again, it's solar.

675
00:28:01.182 --> 00:28:03.450
- It's not...
- Oh, beta, okay, all right.

676
00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:06.020
So, are you enjoying
that Tesla tax write-off then?

677
00:28:06.053 --> 00:28:08.389
I, uh...

678
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:12.393
I sell them.

679
00:28:12.426 --> 00:28:15.396
The solar panels.
I go... I go door to door,

680
00:28:15.429 --> 00:28:17.231
and I try
to sell them to people.

681
00:28:17.264 --> 00:28:20.334
Jack is being bashful.
He was a lawyer.

682
00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:22.203
- Oh, sick!
- Yeah, but then

683
00:28:22.236 --> 00:28:23.871
he got hit
with an assault charge.

684
00:28:23.904 --> 00:28:25.839
- Oh, misdemeanor felony.
- Was a felony,

685
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:27.474
but he got it kicked
down to a misdemeanor,

686
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:30.377
and now he's serving probation
for... three years?

687
00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:32.446
Five...

688
00:28:34.215 --> 00:28:35.416
how do you know that?

689
00:28:36.984 --> 00:28:39.186
Got a guy at the FBI.

690
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.188
And he feeds me information
whenever I have anybody

691
00:28:41.222 --> 00:28:43.490
over to the house.
It's stupid,

692
00:28:43.525 --> 00:28:45.492
but it's...
It's all about safety.

693
00:28:49.063 --> 00:28:52.099
Oh, my God,
you should see your face.

694
00:28:52.132 --> 00:28:53.867
Come on!

695
00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:56.170
Oh, my God, no, man, that was...

696
00:28:56.203 --> 00:28:58.772
that... that was good,

697
00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:00.774
no, your wife told my wife, man.

698
00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:02.276
She... She told Cat that?

699
00:29:02.309 --> 00:29:03.844
Yeah, man,
that's just what they do,

700
00:29:03.877 --> 00:29:05.212
they get alone, and they just...

701
00:29:05.246 --> 00:29:06.514
take us down a peg.

702
00:29:06.548 --> 00:29:08.115
- So what happened?
- I...

703
00:29:10.217 --> 00:29:11.553
I have anger management issues.

704
00:29:11.586 --> 00:29:13.320
Oh, cool, me too!

705
00:29:13.354 --> 00:29:15.155
Oh, so that's
why you're in therapy.

706
00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:16.957
- Got it, got it, got it...
- Lindsay...

707
00:29:16.991 --> 00:29:18.892
Lindsay told Cat that?

708
00:29:18.926 --> 00:29:20.894
Oh, no, that was
Milton's guy at the FBI.

709
00:29:20.928 --> 00:29:23.163
He told us that.

710
00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:32.540
So, it's weird
you know that, man.

711
00:29:32.574 --> 00:29:34.308
- What?
- You know, the therapy,

712
00:29:34.341 --> 00:29:36.277
- that's...
- Dude,

713
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.845
I fuckin' love therapy,
what are you talking about?

714
00:29:37.878 --> 00:29:40.047
No, it's great, just I...

715
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.182
you just, you know,
like, a lot about me,

716
00:29:42.216 --> 00:29:43.551
and I don't really know
anything about you.

717
00:29:43.585 --> 00:29:46.186
Well, if we're
keeping track, my man,

718
00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.921
you know that
my father went to prison

719
00:29:47.955 --> 00:29:49.323
- and that he killed himself.
- I...

720
00:29:49.356 --> 00:29:51.225
Hey, that was
a super-vulnerable thing

721
00:29:51.258 --> 00:29:52.893
to tell a stranger.

722
00:29:52.926 --> 00:29:54.428
- Thanks, bud.
- You're welcome, bro.

723
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:56.430
Yeah, okay, so, um,

724
00:29:56.463 --> 00:29:58.399
- Lindsay...
- Who?

725
00:29:58.432 --> 00:30:00.034
- My wife.
- Lindz.

726
00:30:00.067 --> 00:30:01.969
- Yeah, Lindz.
- Oh.

727
00:30:02.002 --> 00:30:05.406
Lindz, Lindz got into
an argument with this guy

728
00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:08.309
- in a bar, and...
- So you hit him.

729
00:30:08.342 --> 00:30:10.844
No, I mean,
it's not that simple.

730
00:30:10.878 --> 00:30:12.079
- But you hit the guy.
- Yeah, but...

731
00:30:12.112 --> 00:30:13.047
- So it is...
- What?

732
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.114
That simple.

733
00:30:14.148 --> 00:30:15.416
No, I mean, you know,

734
00:30:15.449 --> 00:30:17.351
this fucking guy...

735
00:30:17.384 --> 00:30:19.521
this fucking asshole,
you know, he's fucking...

736
00:30:19.554 --> 00:30:21.221
He's getting into it with
my wife, and the fucking...

737
00:30:21.255 --> 00:30:23.257
he calls her a fucking...
cunt.

738
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.126
- A wh... a what?
- Cunt.

739
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.995
- Cuh... what is he saying?
- I don't have any idea.

740
00:30:28.028 --> 00:30:29.531
- A cunt.
- Oh.

741
00:30:29.564 --> 00:30:31.332
And this fucking asshole
calls my wife...

742
00:30:31.365 --> 00:30:33.233
- Lindz.
- Yes, Lindz, Lindz,

743
00:30:33.267 --> 00:30:34.636
a fucking cunt, you know,
so I fucking...

744
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:36.904
I get really in the guy's face,

745
00:30:36.937 --> 00:30:38.472
he fucking shoves me, and I...
I just... I fucking hit him,

746
00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:40.207
man, I just fucking hit him
across his fucking face.

747
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.109
- Yeah, fuck yeah, dude.
- Fuck yeah.

748
00:30:42.142 --> 00:30:43.877
And this motherfucker,
he ends up being

749
00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:45.312
the fucking son of
a prominent state senator,

750
00:30:45.346 --> 00:30:48.949
- and I'm fucking...
- Oh, fuck.

751
00:30:48.982 --> 00:30:50.918
Jackie.

752
00:30:52.986 --> 00:30:54.622
That's...

753
00:30:54.656 --> 00:30:56.256
that's a hell of a break, man.

754
00:30:58.459 --> 00:31:00.961
Sometimes you don't
have any capital,

755
00:31:00.994 --> 00:31:03.097
and you're really
fucking unlucky,

756
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.533
and you end up disbarred,
on probation,

757
00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:08.369
selling fucking solar panels
door-to-door, so.

758
00:31:08.402 --> 00:31:10.938
- Yeah.
- Hey, here's

759
00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:12.306
to bad luck too, right,
'cause what's the fucking good

760
00:31:12.339 --> 00:31:13.608
without the bad, yeah?

761
00:31:13.641 --> 00:31:15.242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

762
00:31:15.275 --> 00:31:17.177
- To Jack. Oh.
- And...

763
00:31:17.211 --> 00:31:19.179
and for what it's worth,

764
00:31:19.213 --> 00:31:20.981
I'd hit the guy too.

765
00:31:21.014 --> 00:31:23.317
- To Jack.
- Thanks.

766
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.687
Let's get some mung bean bowls.

767
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.988
Then we can all go throw up,
it'll be great.

768
00:31:32.694 --> 00:31:34.228
Who's ready for karaoke?!

769
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:54.448
Jack attack!
Jack attack!

770
00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:05.959
Your husband is so funny!

771
00:32:05.993 --> 00:32:08.362
Oh, he is definitely having fun.

772
00:32:08.395 --> 00:32:10.130
Guys, take the microphone.

773
00:32:12.767 --> 00:32:16.136
No, Jack! No!

774
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.338
Jack, Jack.

775
00:32:18.372 --> 00:32:20.307
Oh, no, I broke... I got it!

776
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.544
- You gotta... it's okay.
- Yeah, Jack!

777
00:32:22.577 --> 00:32:24.445
We'll have someone
clean it up tomorrow.

778
00:32:24.478 --> 00:32:25.747
- Don't worry about it.
- Whoo! Gotta do it again.

779
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.182
No, I did not keep it tight.

780
00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:30.117
My son made that one,
and it is not...

781
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.753
...so mad at me.

782
00:32:31.786 --> 00:32:34.254
Oh, man, Kerry kept
making me take shots,

783
00:32:34.288 --> 00:32:36.089
and I said no,
but then I did 'em.

784
00:32:36.123 --> 00:32:38.258
- So...
- Hey, Jack?

785
00:32:38.292 --> 00:32:40.294
- Hmm? Yeah?
- Honey? This way.

786
00:32:40.327 --> 00:32:41.763
- Mm-kay.
- Okay.

787
00:32:41.796 --> 00:32:43.997
Here we go.
Yeah, okay, that's good.

788
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:46.768
- Thank you.
- Okay.

789
00:32:46.801 --> 00:32:49.737
- What are you gonna do?
- Um, I'm going to go to bed.

790
00:32:49.771 --> 00:32:52.740
What? No, go have fun.

791
00:32:52.774 --> 00:32:55.577
- Really?
- Um, yeah.

792
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.645
You're having fun, right?

793
00:32:57.679 --> 00:32:59.614
I mean, yeah,
I'm having a lot of fun.

794
00:32:59.647 --> 00:33:02.249
- Good.
- Okay.

795
00:33:02.282 --> 00:33:04.017
- Okay.
- All right.

796
00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:05.787
- Mm.
- Mm.

797
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.456
- ...Matt.
- Good night.

798
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.092
- What?
- Matt, he said...

799
00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:15.028
Guy is so smart, so smart.

800
00:33:15.062 --> 00:33:17.364
He was talking
Korean technology,

801
00:33:17.397 --> 00:33:20.267
Japanese green energy, money.

802
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.504
He's the best.

803
00:33:22.537 --> 00:33:27.040
He's really smart...
Jack, you should talk to him.

804
00:33:27.074 --> 00:33:29.209
You should talk to him over
the weekend about business.

805
00:33:29.243 --> 00:33:31.144
I mean, maybe he could
help you find a job.

806
00:33:31.178 --> 00:33:33.280
Nah, I have a job.

807
00:33:33.313 --> 00:33:36.116
I just... I meant maybe
something that you liked

808
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:38.118
because you don't love your job.

809
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:41.488
And maybe there could be
something there

810
00:33:41.523 --> 00:33:43.323
like a different career
or something.

811
00:33:47.127 --> 00:33:48.830
Okay, good night.

812
00:33:48.863 --> 00:33:51.298
Good night,
there's water by the bed.

813
00:33:59.106 --> 00:34:02.409
Uh, hi, um, can I get a tequila?

814
00:34:02.442 --> 00:34:05.547
- Lindsay.
- Um, Daniel, right?

815
00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:09.383
Lindsay.

816
00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:11.318
You don't recognize me?

817
00:34:11.351 --> 00:34:13.220
Dan.

818
00:34:13.253 --> 00:34:15.188
Dan Bishop.

819
00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:17.291
Lindsay Simpson.

820
00:34:17.324 --> 00:34:19.192
- Holy shit.
- I know.

821
00:34:19.226 --> 00:34:21.663
Oh, my God.

822
00:34:21.696 --> 00:34:23.665
What are you doing here?

823
00:34:23.698 --> 00:34:25.767
Uh, I work for the Flaxes.

824
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.569
Well, I work for Milton.

825
00:34:27.602 --> 00:34:29.469
But yeah,

826
00:34:29.504 --> 00:34:31.639
Oh, my God, that... I mean,

827
00:34:31.673 --> 00:34:35.108
Wow, you...
You look so different.

828
00:34:35.142 --> 00:34:37.879
I know, well,
I was a trainer at Sea World,

829
00:34:37.912 --> 00:34:39.781
and I quit that
when it stopped being cool

830
00:34:39.814 --> 00:34:42.449
and, you know, started
fighting the fires up here,

831
00:34:42.482 --> 00:34:44.586
and went to Burning Man,
met these folks...

832
00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:45.720
- It was like...
- Oh, my God!

833
00:34:45.753 --> 00:34:47.254
It all fell into line.

834
00:34:47.287 --> 00:34:50.290
That is truly wild.

835
00:34:50.324 --> 00:34:52.459
Um, I just... thank you.

836
00:34:52.492 --> 00:34:56.330
- Um, so...
- And, uh, your husband,

837
00:34:56.363 --> 00:34:59.466
- he was, what...
- He's a lawyer.

838
00:34:59.499 --> 00:35:01.435
- He's a lawyer.
- He is?

839
00:35:01.468 --> 00:35:03.270
And I work in fashion.

840
00:35:03.303 --> 00:35:05.138
- What? That's amazing.
- Yeah.

841
00:35:05.172 --> 00:35:07.307
Thank you, um, can I...

842
00:35:07.341 --> 00:35:09.142
- Can I get just a little...
- Lindsay Simpson.

843
00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:11.211
...Just a refill,
my song's about to come up.

844
00:35:11.244 --> 00:35:12.847
- So I gotta...
- Well, let's get you

845
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.415
- warmed up, girl.
- I gotta go, but you,

846
00:35:15.449 --> 00:35:17.785
you look great,
it's so good to see you.

847
00:35:17.819 --> 00:35:19.621
I'll see you.
We'll be seeing you.

848
00:35:19.654 --> 00:35:21.756
Yeah, I'll be here
all weekend, don't worry.

849
00:35:28.529 --> 00:35:31.398
Hi... ya.

850
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:33.266
I was hoping
you would come back.

851
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.769
Oh, my God.

852
00:35:34.802 --> 00:35:36.704
- Is Jack okay?
- Jack is fine.

853
00:35:36.738 --> 00:35:38.372
He didn't throw up
or anything? Does he need...

854
00:35:38.405 --> 00:35:40.173
No, no-no-no, he's sleeping, um,

855
00:35:40.207 --> 00:35:41.609
do you remember earlier,
when I said that I thought

856
00:35:41.643 --> 00:35:43.611
- I recognized the waiter?
- Oh, Daniel.

857
00:35:43.645 --> 00:35:44.612
- Yeah, Dan.
- Daniel.

858
00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:46.346
Dan, Dan Bishop.

859
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.447
I went to high school with Dan.

860
00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:49.182
Daniel Bishop.
Shut up.

861
00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:51.451
- Yeah, no, I went...
- What are the odds?

862
00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:54.522
The odds that I, uh,
would be a person

863
00:35:54.555 --> 00:35:56.791
who had a lot of sex
with someone

864
00:35:56.824 --> 00:35:58.458
- who works at her house?
- You did sex...

865
00:35:58.492 --> 00:35:59.894
Are very small!

866
00:35:59.927 --> 00:36:01.228
- Wow!
- Yeah.

867
00:36:02.563 --> 00:36:04.231
That is so hot.

868
00:36:04.264 --> 00:36:06.534
Well...

869
00:36:06.567 --> 00:36:08.803
That's not all.

870
00:36:08.836 --> 00:36:10.605
Dan had a nickname.

871
00:36:10.638 --> 00:36:12.907
- What was his nickname?
- Big Dick Dan.

872
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.475
- Big Dick Dan?
- Dan has a massive dick.

873
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.711
Yes!

874
00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:18.613
- I love that.
- Okay.

875
00:36:18.646 --> 00:36:20.447
- I love that so much.
- Well, yeah.

876
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.282
- Oh, my gosh.
- It would be so fun

877
00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:24.384
and such a fun story

878
00:36:24.418 --> 00:36:25.987
if it wasn't for the fact that
all of my sorority sisters

879
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.755
knew about it...
When I started dating Jack,

880
00:36:27.789 --> 00:36:29.356
they would tease him.

881
00:36:29.389 --> 00:36:30.658
Does Jack not have a big dick?

882
00:36:30.692 --> 00:36:32.492
No, Jack has a great dick.

883
00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:34.261
He has a great dick,
it's just like,

884
00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:35.563
it's like husband dick,
like he's my husband.

885
00:36:35.596 --> 00:36:37.297
- You know?
- Yeah, I do know.

886
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.900
- Unfortunately.
- He's been pretty cool

887
00:36:38.933 --> 00:36:40.902
about it, it's just that...

888
00:36:40.935 --> 00:36:43.336
I... I don't know
how he's gonna react.

889
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.640
- Mmm.
- It's an old wound.

890
00:36:45.673 --> 00:36:47.374
- You know what I mean?
- Why does it... Why does it

891
00:36:47.407 --> 00:36:48.943
need to be a thing?

892
00:36:48.976 --> 00:36:50.578
Well, because I'm gonna be

893
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:51.979
a terrible person
if I don't tell him.

894
00:36:52.013 --> 00:36:53.815
You don't have to tell him shit.

895
00:36:53.848 --> 00:36:55.650
- What?
- Why do you have

896
00:36:55.683 --> 00:36:57.685
to tell him that?
You could just not tell him.

897
00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:00.387
In what world do I just
ignore Big Dick Dan

898
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.623
- for the rest of the week?
- I don't want you to.

899
00:37:02.657 --> 00:37:04.525
But maybe you kind of have to.

900
00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:06.460
Or I could just fire him.

901
00:37:06.493 --> 00:37:07.895
- Because then...
- What?!

902
00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:09.597
You don't have
to think about it,

903
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.364
Jack doesn't have to get
upset, and then we can...

904
00:37:11.398 --> 00:37:13.266
- Are you messing with me?
- Daniel!

905
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.302
- No! Cat, seriously.
- I feel like you...

906
00:37:15.335 --> 00:37:17.270
No, tequila's great!
Thank you!

907
00:37:17.304 --> 00:37:18.973
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry, I just

908
00:37:19.006 --> 00:37:20.708
want you to have
a good time, okay?

909
00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:22.342
- Okay, so then...
- Okay.

910
00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:23.978
...Maybe for tonight
we can just...

911
00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:27.582
- forget about it?
- Hey, can you keep a secret?

912
00:37:27.615 --> 00:37:30.885
- Yeah.
- Keep it a secret.

913
00:37:58.913 --> 00:38:00.782
Fuck...

914
00:38:00.815 --> 00:38:02.016
Oh...

915
00:38:03.851 --> 00:38:05.820
Oh, my...

916
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.996
Oh, fuck.

917
00:38:15.029 --> 00:38:17.031
Oh.

918
00:38:17.064 --> 00:38:19.466
Babe, this doesn't
even have to be an argument.

919
00:38:19.499 --> 00:38:22.435
I can take the plane
and be back in time from Dubai

920
00:38:22.469 --> 00:38:24.071
to see his art installation.

921
00:38:24.105 --> 00:38:25.973
Except I don't believe you.

922
00:38:26.007 --> 00:38:27.842
You're not gonna make it
back at time, and then I...

923
00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:29.844
Why does he wear so much
eyeliner to those things?

924
00:38:29.877 --> 00:38:32.412
Because it's part of his look.

925
00:38:32.445 --> 00:38:34.081
He's establishing himself
as an artist.

926
00:38:34.115 --> 00:38:36.083
Well, I don't wanna
raise a weird kid

927
00:38:36.117 --> 00:38:37.618
who dresses in black
all the time.

928
00:38:37.652 --> 00:38:39.086
If he's weird,
then he's gonna be...

929
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.689
Jack, hey, morning!
You sleep okay?

930
00:38:41.722 --> 00:38:44.391
- Hi, is Lindz up?
- Uh, no, no.

931
00:38:44.424 --> 00:38:46.527
She, um...

932
00:38:46.561 --> 00:38:48.763
I'm... I am like...

933
00:38:48.796 --> 00:38:50.998
Uh, we-we-we... we got
after it last night, huh?

934
00:38:51.032 --> 00:38:53.100
You definitely took it
up a notch, my man,

935
00:38:53.134 --> 00:38:55.368
but hey, when you work hard,
you get to play hard.

936
00:38:55.402 --> 00:38:57.505
Am I right?

937
00:38:57.538 --> 00:38:59.040
You going for a run?

938
00:38:59.073 --> 00:39:00.808
Yeah, yeah, no,
I'm gonna, you know,

939
00:39:00.842 --> 00:39:03.611
try to sweat it out
before I put it back in.

940
00:39:03.644 --> 00:39:05.478
Detox, retox, circle of life.

941
00:39:05.513 --> 00:39:07.048
- You should use the gym.
- The gym?

942
00:39:07.081 --> 00:39:08.616
There's one downstairs
and then another one

943
00:39:08.649 --> 00:39:10.117
- down below by the pool.
- The pool?

944
00:39:10.151 --> 00:39:12.053
Yeah, the one downstairs
is kind of sterile.

945
00:39:12.086 --> 00:39:13.855
Agreed, I prefer
the one at the guest house.

946
00:39:13.888 --> 00:39:15.656
- The guest house?
- Also, Kerry's

947
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.792
in the gym downstairs,
and he is a lot in there.

948
00:39:17.825 --> 00:39:19.894
- At the guest house.
- No, downstairs.

949
00:39:19.927 --> 00:39:21.062
But I think
Carrie's at the sauna.

950
00:39:21.095 --> 00:39:22.563
- Oh.
- Where?

951
00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:23.965
- By the pool.
- Which is?

952
00:39:23.998 --> 00:39:25.867
- Down below.
- Down below.

953
00:39:27.068 --> 00:39:28.936
Great.

954
00:39:30.938 --> 00:39:33.908
There it is.

955
00:39:33.941 --> 00:39:36.711
- Have fun.
- Sweat it out.

956
00:39:36.744 --> 00:39:38.946
- He's gonna get lost.
- Yeah.

957
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.683
Hah! Hah!

958
00:39:42.717 --> 00:39:44.986
Hah!

959
00:39:45.019 --> 00:39:48.421
Hah! Hah!
Hey, buddy!

960
00:39:48.455 --> 00:39:50.024
Hah!

961
00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:53.127
I miss you, Daddy!
I miss you, Daddy!

962
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.795
I hate you, Daddy!

963
00:40:25.893 --> 00:40:27.662
- Hey.
- Hey.

964
00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:29.130
- How you doing?
- I'm good, brother.

965
00:40:29.163 --> 00:40:31.132
Just enjoying the bounty
of a beautiful day.

966
00:40:31.165 --> 00:40:33.668
- Right on.
- Hey, you're Jack, right?

967
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:35.937
- Lindsay's husband.
- Yeah, yeah, man, you guys...

968
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.772
Man, it is great to meet you.

969
00:40:37.805 --> 00:40:39.974
Yeah, you guys...

970
00:40:40.007 --> 00:40:41.776
you guys too,
I'm looking for the...

971
00:40:41.809 --> 00:40:44.078
- the guest house?
- Which one?

972
00:40:44.111 --> 00:40:47.148
The... The one
with the pool?

973
00:40:47.181 --> 00:40:49.150
Oh, yeah, it's just
right down that way.

974
00:40:49.183 --> 00:40:50.718
- You're heading there, right?
- That way?

975
00:40:50.751 --> 00:40:52.253
- Yeah.
- So I just... okay.

976
00:40:52.286 --> 00:40:54.055
Follow the path, brother,
you'll get there.

977
00:41:01.128 --> 00:41:03.698
Oh, hey!
I'm here, sorry.

978
00:41:03.731 --> 00:41:06.033
I'm here.

979
00:41:06.067 --> 00:41:08.769
- You almost saw me naked.
- I almost did.

980
00:41:08.803 --> 00:41:10.705
- Almost.
- Almost.

981
00:41:10.738 --> 00:41:12.974
Oh!

982
00:41:13.007 --> 00:41:15.609
One more!

983
00:41:15.643 --> 00:41:16.978
Oh, please...
Please stop doing that.

984
00:41:17.011 --> 00:41:18.646
I'm just kidding.
I wouldn't do that.

985
00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:20.548
- Okay.
- Maybe I would.

986
00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:22.817
I...

987
00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:25.686
Oh, my God, how fucking
absurd is this place?

988
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.655
Thank you.
Thank you, this is like,

989
00:41:27.688 --> 00:41:29.523
I've never seen
anything like this.

990
00:41:29.557 --> 00:41:31.759
I, like, need this
to work out with me and Ker.

991
00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:33.127
I can't go back to being poor.

992
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.795
Back to being a model, yeah?

993
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:36.664
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, that's cool.

994
00:41:36.697 --> 00:41:37.898
Have I seen you in anything?

995
00:41:37.932 --> 00:41:39.266
Do you watch "Murderer Minds"?

996
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.235
- No.
- I was murdered on it.

997
00:41:41.268 --> 00:41:43.838
- Cool.
- I also sing,

998
00:41:43.871 --> 00:41:45.873
dance, paint.

999
00:41:45.906 --> 00:41:47.208
Run a wellness Instagram account

1000
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:48.776
with over 50,000 followers.

1001
00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:50.778
Oh, wow. You got
a lot going on, huh?

1002
00:41:50.811 --> 00:41:53.147
Not really, I just try
to speak it into existence.

1003
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.882
Like "The Secret."

1004
00:41:55.983 --> 00:41:57.885
No, it's not a secret.
I just don't wanna work hard.

1005
00:42:02.823 --> 00:42:04.658
Okay.

1006
00:42:06.827 --> 00:42:08.295
I'm bored.

1007
00:42:12.133 --> 00:42:14.168
Cool.

1008
00:42:24.912 --> 00:42:26.680
Oh...

1009
00:43:15.763 --> 00:43:18.833
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1010
00:43:18.866 --> 00:43:20.935
- What're you getting?
- Mischief.

1011
00:43:20.968 --> 00:43:22.870
All right, okay.

1012
00:43:22.903 --> 00:43:24.939
How about a little...
Ooh, this one has

1013
00:43:24.972 --> 00:43:26.907
some secrets.

1014
00:43:26.941 --> 00:43:29.677
Did you guys know that nearly 3%

1015
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.214
of Atlantic glaciers is
penguin urine?

1016
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.384
Car, who told you that?

1017
00:43:37.418 --> 00:43:39.053
I learned it at Harvard.

1018
00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:45.860
That's awesome.
You went to Harvard.

1019
00:43:45.893 --> 00:43:47.661
Yeah, you didn't know?

1020
00:43:47.695 --> 00:43:49.697
No, no, I didn't...

1021
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:52.333
Lindz, just have one.

1022
00:43:52.366 --> 00:43:54.235
- God, I...
- Come on, we're wine tasting

1023
00:43:54.268 --> 00:43:56.170
in, like, 30 minutes, this'll
get you back in the game.

1024
00:43:56.203 --> 00:43:58.973
I know, I just... I feel
like I'm dying right now.

1025
00:43:59.006 --> 00:44:00.374
Did you drink the electrolytes?

1026
00:44:00.407 --> 00:44:02.276
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1027
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:04.011
I'll text Milton
and have him put

1028
00:44:04.044 --> 00:44:05.813
- another kit in the room.
- Okay.

1029
00:44:05.846 --> 00:44:08.749
I'm sorry, hey,
who... who is Milton?

1030
00:44:09.884 --> 00:44:11.252
He's Milton.

1031
00:44:11.285 --> 00:44:13.154
What would you say his job is?

1032
00:44:13.187 --> 00:44:15.322
- Jack.
- Um...

1033
00:44:15.356 --> 00:44:17.925
I think he was, like,
a party planner

1034
00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:19.793
or maybe an interior designer.

1035
00:44:19.827 --> 00:44:21.829
Um, Matt, babe,
how would you describe

1036
00:44:21.862 --> 00:44:24.465
- what Milton does?
- Uh...

1037
00:44:24.498 --> 00:44:27.468
he's...
he's Milton.

1038
00:44:27.502 --> 00:44:29.837
Okay, and then
the... the-the guys,

1039
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.705
I met the guy watering
the plant today

1040
00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:33.707
- with the mullet.
- Uh, that is Daniel.

1041
00:44:33.741 --> 00:44:36.043
- Daniel... and Daniel...
- Oh, Dan!

1042
00:44:36.076 --> 00:44:37.845
Yeah, Brother Dan,
Dan is the man!

1043
00:44:37.878 --> 00:44:40.781
Daniel is Daniel, and I...

1044
00:44:40.814 --> 00:44:42.750
don't want to talk
about it anymore.

1045
00:44:42.783 --> 00:44:44.051
It's high acid.

1046
00:44:44.084 --> 00:44:45.853
What I do want to talk about is

1047
00:44:45.886 --> 00:44:47.755
my... babe...

1048
00:44:47.788 --> 00:44:49.256
- Do you feel that...
- Babe, I'm trying to...

1049
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.891
- I'm having a moment.
- What, babe, what?

1050
00:44:50.925 --> 00:44:52.092
- Please.
- I'm talking...

1051
00:44:52.126 --> 00:44:53.794
I'm talking too!

1052
00:44:53.827 --> 00:44:56.163
What I do want to talk about is

1053
00:44:56.197 --> 00:44:58.499
my friend Lindz.

1054
00:44:58.533 --> 00:45:01.068
Matt, did you know
that Lindz was studying

1055
00:45:01.101 --> 00:45:03.003
at FIDM
before Jack got disbarred

1056
00:45:03.037 --> 00:45:05.406
- and her mother died?
- Oh, no, I didn't know that.

1057
00:45:05.439 --> 00:45:07.775
- Yeah.
- Jack didn't get disbarred.

1058
00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:09.176
- He's just...
- She wanted to make upscale

1059
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.378
sustainable clothing.

1060
00:45:11.412 --> 00:45:13.414
You want to make
upscale sustainable clothing.

1061
00:45:13.447 --> 00:45:17.117
I've been thinking about it,
and I wanna help Lindz

1062
00:45:17.151 --> 00:45:20.921
realize her dream
of becoming a girl boss.

1063
00:45:20.955 --> 00:45:22.790
Yes, girl boss.

1064
00:45:22.823 --> 00:45:25.092
- Wait, what?
- Wait, what?

1065
00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:27.529
I think we should invest
in our friend Lindz

1066
00:45:27.562 --> 00:45:30.164
and help make
her dream a reality.

1067
00:45:30.197 --> 00:45:32.199
Hey...

1068
00:45:32.233 --> 00:45:33.467
sure, yeah.

1069
00:45:33.501 --> 00:45:34.935
Right on... congrats, Lindz.

1070
00:45:34.969 --> 00:45:36.303
- Let's do it.
- Yeah!

1071
00:45:36.337 --> 00:45:37.938
- Let's do it.
- Congratulations!

1072
00:45:39.473 --> 00:45:41.875
- What...
- Cheers! Cheers!

1073
00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:43.844
- Yeah, no, we're...
- Congratulations.

1074
00:45:43.877 --> 00:45:47.014
Oh, sure,
it's... thank you!

1075
00:45:47.047 --> 00:45:48.849
- Oh, my God.
- Of course.

1076
00:45:48.882 --> 00:45:50.317
- Yeah.
- So, I... I mean,

1077
00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:52.453
what...

1078
00:45:52.486 --> 00:45:54.488
so do you wanna do the store?
Or do you wanna do a line?

1079
00:45:54.522 --> 00:45:55.923
Oh, well, I haven't really
thought about it, let's talk

1080
00:45:55.956 --> 00:45:57.258
- about it later, okay?
- Okay.

1081
00:45:57.291 --> 00:45:58.926
We gotta do wine tasting
first, remember?

1082
00:45:58.959 --> 00:46:00.361
- What just happened?
- Wine tasting

1083
00:46:00.394 --> 00:46:02.196
- is happening.
- Whoo!

1084
00:46:02.229 --> 00:46:04.465
There's this cute
little place down the road.

1085
00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:06.267
All the workers who pick
the grapes are given

1086
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.102
insurance and livable wages.

1087
00:46:08.135 --> 00:46:10.104
- And we have to support them.
- I got it.

1088
00:46:10.137 --> 00:46:12.139
Matt, do you wanna...
Do you want me to pitch in?

1089
00:46:12.172 --> 00:46:13.575
I could just sell
my car or something.

1090
00:46:13.608 --> 00:46:15.510
I could probably...

1091
00:46:15.543 --> 00:46:17.411
- This guy!
- We got it.

1092
00:46:17.444 --> 00:46:19.146
- He's so funny.
- You know...

1093
00:46:19.179 --> 00:46:21.415
Jack, I will
take payment from you

1094
00:46:21.448 --> 00:46:22.916
in karate-chopping my enemies.

1095
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:24.351
Kerry, Kerry,

1096
00:46:24.385 --> 00:46:25.953
did you hear that?
That was so funny.

1097
00:46:25.986 --> 00:46:27.855
- Hilarious.
- Finish your drinks.

1098
00:46:27.888 --> 00:46:29.189
- Finish your drinks, dummies.
- Let's go, come on.

1099
00:46:29.223 --> 00:46:30.592
- Okay, okay, bottoms up.
- Oh, hey...

1100
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:32.594
- Yes.
- Jack, are you gonna drive?

1101
00:46:32.627 --> 00:46:34.495
Yeah, I'll drive
Lindsay and I separate,

1102
00:46:34.529 --> 00:46:35.929
and we'll meet you guys
there, yeah?

1103
00:46:38.198 --> 00:46:41.402
- What the fuck just happened?
- I know.

1104
00:46:41.435 --> 00:46:45.039
Okay, this is now not
just a fun weekend,

1105
00:46:45.072 --> 00:46:46.874
this is also a business weekend.

1106
00:46:46.907 --> 00:46:48.976
She could become my colleague.

1107
00:46:49.009 --> 00:46:51.845
Keeping it tight,
maybe not joke about us

1108
00:46:51.879 --> 00:46:53.914
being poor at the dinner table?

1109
00:46:53.947 --> 00:46:55.983
But we're... we're not poor.

1110
00:46:56.016 --> 00:46:57.484
No, I know that we're not poor,

1111
00:46:57.519 --> 00:47:00.187
but compared to them,
we definitely are.

1112
00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.922
Right, but compared to them,

1113
00:47:01.955 --> 00:47:03.625
99.9% of the world is,

1114
00:47:03.658 --> 00:47:06.160
I mean, Gary's grandfather
invented tater tots,

1115
00:47:06.193 --> 00:47:08.329
and Matt's worth, like,
a billion dollars.

1116
00:47:08.362 --> 00:47:10.164
- How do you know?
- I had service

1117
00:47:10.197 --> 00:47:11.131
in the restaurant
and Googled him.

1118
00:47:11.165 --> 00:47:12.866
Wait, why...

1119
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.602
- Why'd you Google him?
- Why'd I...

1120
00:47:14.636 --> 00:47:16.403
He ran a background check
on me... I can't Google him?

1121
00:47:16.437 --> 00:47:17.905
- No, I just...
- You said everybody Googles.

1122
00:47:17.938 --> 00:47:19.940
Okay, just stop saying Google.

1123
00:47:26.614 --> 00:47:28.516
Get your nose in the glass.

1124
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.984
Get it in there.
Further, further.

1125
00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:32.419
Come on, let's go ask Georges.

1126
00:47:32.453 --> 00:47:34.589
Get it in there.

1127
00:47:34.622 --> 00:47:37.625
Georges?
Am I on pills,

1128
00:47:37.659 --> 00:47:39.493
or does this taste
more like a burgundy?

1129
00:47:39.527 --> 00:47:41.228
No, you're not.

1130
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:43.263
Actually, it's because
it has a lower

1131
00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:45.432
alcohol content
than most California pinots.

1132
00:47:45.466 --> 00:47:47.669
- Mmm.
- It's because

1133
00:47:47.702 --> 00:47:49.370
we're bio dynamic.

1134
00:47:49.403 --> 00:47:51.205
- Obviously.
- Obviously, now,

1135
00:47:51.238 --> 00:47:53.541
correct me if I'm wrong,
but aren't you only

1136
00:47:53.575 --> 00:47:56.611
one of four bio dynamic
vineyards in California?

1137
00:47:56.644 --> 00:47:58.245
- Am I right?
- One of four

1138
00:47:58.278 --> 00:47:59.446
certified by
the French government.

1139
00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.281
- Ahh.
- Yes.

1140
00:48:01.315 --> 00:48:03.117
I love France.

1141
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:05.185
- Yeah, she does!
- Yeah, baby!

1142
00:48:05.219 --> 00:48:07.154
That's... a great place.

1143
00:48:07.187 --> 00:48:09.591
I love France.

1144
00:48:09.624 --> 00:48:11.626
Honestly, I would love
to go to Provence.

1145
00:48:11.659 --> 00:48:13.628
Oh, we're going.

1146
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:16.463
After you've set up the line.

1147
00:48:16.497 --> 00:48:20.134
You're... You're really serious
about this, aren't you?

1148
00:48:20.167 --> 00:48:22.436
Be pretty fucked up if I wasn't.

1149
00:48:22.469 --> 00:48:25.205
Hey, babe?

1150
00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:28.242
- Yeah, babe?
- What... What do we like?

1151
00:48:28.275 --> 00:48:30.043
Uh, what do you like?

1152
00:48:30.077 --> 00:48:32.346
- Um... oh, I like the white.
- Which?

1153
00:48:32.379 --> 00:48:35.482
Oh, um...
all of 'em.

1154
00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:37.519
Get all the whites!

1155
00:48:39.587 --> 00:48:41.054
You can spit the wine.
You don't have to swallow it

1156
00:48:41.088 --> 00:48:42.389
- every time.
- Oh!

1157
00:48:42.423 --> 00:48:44.091
No, I like swallowing.

1158
00:48:44.124 --> 00:48:45.693
You heard the lady,
why don't we do

1159
00:48:45.727 --> 00:48:48.061
a case of each?

1160
00:48:48.095 --> 00:48:49.963
Oh...

1161
00:48:49.997 --> 00:48:51.733
okay.

1162
00:48:51.766 --> 00:48:54.368
Okay, um, why don't
I bring those to the car?

1163
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:56.437
And you can finish up
your glasses here?

1164
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:58.105
- Love it.
- Actually, Georges,

1165
00:48:58.138 --> 00:48:59.406
you know what?
Why don't you just, uh,

1166
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.974
why don't you just double it?

1167
00:49:01.008 --> 00:49:03.711
Oh... double it?

1168
00:49:03.745 --> 00:49:06.346
- Yeah, two cases of each.
- Each.

1169
00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.650
Okay, well, sorry.

1170
00:49:08.683 --> 00:49:10.317
I went to Berkeley,

1171
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.252
so we didn't...
Numbers were just shapes.

1172
00:49:12.286 --> 00:49:14.589
- Sure, sure, sure...
- So, you want...

1173
00:49:14.622 --> 00:49:19.092
two of both varietals
or four of both varietals?

1174
00:49:19.126 --> 00:49:21.328
- Yes, both.
- Yes, both.

1175
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.667
- Each.
- Each.

1176
00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.334
Wonderful.

1177
00:49:27.367 --> 00:49:29.136
- That's white.
- Oh... oopsies.

1178
00:49:29.169 --> 00:49:31.004
It's rosé.

1179
00:49:31.038 --> 00:49:32.640
I don't think...
Is that how they make rosé?

1180
00:49:32.674 --> 00:49:34.441
Mm-hm, you just mix
red and white.

1181
00:49:34.475 --> 00:49:36.644
- Okay. Hi, hi.
- Hi, um,

1182
00:49:36.678 --> 00:49:38.580
- which one did you like?
- I, uh...

1183
00:49:38.613 --> 00:49:40.582
- Hi, thank you.
- Try the rosé.

1184
00:49:40.615 --> 00:49:42.249
- Hi.
- No, it's... we're great.

1185
00:49:42.282 --> 00:49:44.084
Which... Which wine did
I like, Carrie?

1186
00:49:44.117 --> 00:49:46.453
Jackie likes the penis noir.

1187
00:49:48.355 --> 00:49:51.091
Penis... Pinot noir.

1188
00:49:51.124 --> 00:49:53.060
'Cause he likes the penis!

1189
00:49:53.093 --> 00:49:54.428
- Okay.
- Okay, hey,

1190
00:49:54.461 --> 00:49:56.029
so I think
we should get some wine.

1191
00:49:56.063 --> 00:49:57.732
- Can you take care of that?
- Yeah.

1192
00:49:57.765 --> 00:49:59.433
Yeah, no, I'll get some wine.

1193
00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:01.569
That's good. Can you maybe
just... no, okay.

1194
00:50:01.603 --> 00:50:03.203
Bye.

1195
00:50:03.237 --> 00:50:05.105
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1196
00:50:05.138 --> 00:50:07.407
I guess I need
a bottle of, um, the...

1197
00:50:07.441 --> 00:50:09.176
The Pinot noir.

1198
00:50:09.209 --> 00:50:10.678
Okay, just a bottle?

1199
00:50:10.712 --> 00:50:12.346
Yeah, just...
Just a bottle, please?

1200
00:50:13.681 --> 00:50:15.550
- Can I see the price sheet?
- No.

1201
00:50:15.583 --> 00:50:18.452
I'm sorry, I...

1202
00:50:18.485 --> 00:50:20.387
it's market price,
so it just kind of like

1203
00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.122
is what I feel at the moment.

1204
00:50:22.155 --> 00:50:23.825
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

1205
00:50:23.858 --> 00:50:25.827
- Oh! Okay.
- There she goes.

1206
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:27.562
- Just...
- There she goes.

1207
00:50:27.595 --> 00:50:29.329
- Oh, boy.
- She's fun.

1208
00:50:29.363 --> 00:50:31.498
- Yeah, she's fun.
- Oh, maybe we...

1209
00:50:31.533 --> 00:50:33.367
Maybe we get to some
water there, Car-Bear.

1210
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.102
No water...

1211
00:50:35.135 --> 00:50:37.437
Hey, Kerry, do you wanna
help me out here, bud?

1212
00:50:37.471 --> 00:50:39.339
Dude, she's like 11 pounds,
you got it.

1213
00:50:39.373 --> 00:50:40.742
- Okay.
- You're doing great, Jack.

1214
00:50:40.775 --> 00:50:42.810
- Okay...
- Whee!

1215
00:50:42.844 --> 00:50:44.679
Okay, I'm just gonna...

1216
00:50:44.712 --> 00:50:46.581
Ballet!

1217
00:50:46.614 --> 00:50:49.116
- Turn her on her side.
- Oh, that's sweet.

1218
00:50:49.149 --> 00:50:50.450
- That's sweet.
- Well, I just don't want her

1219
00:50:50.484 --> 00:50:52.252
to throw up
on those hair extensions.

1220
00:50:52.286 --> 00:50:53.688
Take off those shoes,
they're very expensive.

1221
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:56.524
I have those.
My wife has those.

1222
00:50:56.558 --> 00:50:58.325
Yeah.

1223
00:50:58.358 --> 00:50:59.794
- Carrie is drunk.
- Yeah.

1224
00:50:59.827 --> 00:51:02.262
Maybe we ought a,
like... yeah?

1225
00:51:02.296 --> 00:51:04.231
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

1226
00:51:04.264 --> 00:51:06.333
Sure.

1227
00:51:06.366 --> 00:51:08.302
- You're terrible.
- I know.

1228
00:51:08.335 --> 00:51:10.404
So bad.
She's the worst, though.

1229
00:51:12.439 --> 00:51:14.341
No, you did not say that.

1230
00:51:14.374 --> 00:51:15.743
You didn't.

1231
00:51:15.777 --> 00:51:17.545
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

1232
00:51:17.579 --> 00:51:19.379
Uh, we may need to Uber home.

1233
00:51:19.413 --> 00:51:21.816
- Ooh, we don't have room?
- Yeah, no.

1234
00:51:21.849 --> 00:51:23.483
Hey, I got the wine.

1235
00:51:24.919 --> 00:51:27.354
- Yeah, what?
- Just...

1236
00:51:27.387 --> 00:51:28.723
...why did you

1237
00:51:28.756 --> 00:51:30.892
only get a bottle?

1238
00:51:30.925 --> 00:51:32.627
Well, because Carrie said
it was my favorite.

1239
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.428
It's the penis noir, and then

1240
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:36.129
Matt said it would go
with the BBQ tonight.

1241
00:51:36.163 --> 00:51:37.799
Okay, but why didn't
you get a case?

1242
00:51:37.832 --> 00:51:39.534
'Cause they're, like,
really expensive.

1243
00:51:39.567 --> 00:51:41.603
- Like how expensive?
- Like... Like, a lot.

1244
00:51:41.636 --> 00:51:44.237
- What's a lot?
- Like, $50 a bottle.

1245
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:46.440
Oh... okay, well,

1246
00:51:46.473 --> 00:51:48.676
just put it on the Master card.
We can afford that.

1247
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:51.613
You wanna waste $300
on six bottles of wine?

1248
00:51:51.646 --> 00:51:53.480
- A case is 12.
- A case is six.

1249
00:51:53.514 --> 00:51:55.415
- A case of beer is 12.
- A case of beer is 24.

1250
00:51:55.449 --> 00:51:56.551
- What is a case of 12?
- I have no idea, White Claw?

1251
00:51:56.584 --> 00:51:57.919
Just buy it.

1252
00:51:57.952 --> 00:51:59.386
Lindsay, that's a car payment.

1253
00:51:59.419 --> 00:52:00.688
Hey, Georges, I'm so sorry.

1254
00:52:00.722 --> 00:52:02.422
- Hi.
- Hi.

1255
00:52:02.456 --> 00:52:03.891
My husband made a mistake.

1256
00:52:03.925 --> 00:52:05.292
We are actually going
to take a case

1257
00:52:05.325 --> 00:52:06.794
of the Pinot grigio.

1258
00:52:06.828 --> 00:52:09.463
- Pinot noir.
- Of the Pinot noir.

1259
00:52:09.496 --> 00:52:11.164
Absolutely.

1260
00:52:11.198 --> 00:52:12.734
And you know what,
actually, we're gonna get

1261
00:52:12.767 --> 00:52:14.669
two cases, right?

1262
00:52:14.702 --> 00:52:17.270
Because we can have
one with the dinner tonight,

1263
00:52:17.304 --> 00:52:19.774
and then we can take one home,
right, Jack?

1264
00:52:19.807 --> 00:52:21.542
It's gonna go great
with the dinner.

1265
00:52:21.576 --> 00:52:23.243
Yeah, you know,
you do get a discount

1266
00:52:23.276 --> 00:52:24.912
if you buy a case.
That's great.

1267
00:52:24.946 --> 00:52:26.681
So just charge the same card?

1268
00:52:26.714 --> 00:52:28.382
- Yes, absolutely.
- Okay.

1269
00:52:28.415 --> 00:52:30.484
- Thank you so much.
- That is...

1270
00:52:30.518 --> 00:52:32.820
- so thoughtful of you.
- Ugh, oh, my gosh.

1271
00:52:32.854 --> 00:52:34.789
It's the least we could do,
right, Jack?

1272
00:52:34.822 --> 00:52:37.725
Yeah, yeah, you know,
I just... I just had a thought.

1273
00:52:37.759 --> 00:52:39.560
What if... What if we take
the Tesla back

1274
00:52:39.594 --> 00:52:40.928
since we're waiting
for the rest of the wine

1275
00:52:40.962 --> 00:52:42.530
to show up, and you guys
just take my car,

1276
00:52:42.563 --> 00:52:43.631
and we'll see you
back there, yeah?

1277
00:52:43.665 --> 00:52:45.265
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1278
00:52:45.298 --> 00:52:46.466
Do you know
how to drive a Tesla,

1279
00:52:46.501 --> 00:52:49.269
- Jack?
- Do I...

1280
00:52:49.302 --> 00:52:51.839
I think the real question, Ker,

1281
00:52:51.873 --> 00:52:54.274
is do you know
how to drive a Corolla?

1282
00:52:54.307 --> 00:52:56.744
So funny.

1283
00:52:56.778 --> 00:52:59.212
You... You put it in drive?

1284
00:52:59.246 --> 00:53:00.948
Yep, just start it, drive,
you're good to go.

1285
00:53:00.982 --> 00:53:03.951
- All right.
- Okay.

1286
00:53:03.985 --> 00:53:05.753
- Okay.
- Okay, cool,

1287
00:53:05.787 --> 00:53:07.421
we'll just do
a little switcheroo.

1288
00:53:07.454 --> 00:53:08.823
- Cute, love it.
- Right.

1289
00:53:08.856 --> 00:53:11.291
- Thanks, Jackie.
- Okay.

1290
00:53:11.324 --> 00:53:13.761
Definitely sitting up here.

1291
00:53:13.795 --> 00:53:15.530
- Thank you.
- Watch your head, Carrie.

1292
00:53:15.563 --> 00:53:16.964
- Ooh!
- Good work.

1293
00:53:16.998 --> 00:53:18.498
Oh, she lost her little crown.

1294
00:53:18.533 --> 00:53:19.867
Yeah, that's okay.

1295
00:53:19.901 --> 00:53:21.636
Okay.

1296
00:53:21.669 --> 00:53:24.672
Yeah... origami.

1297
00:53:31.579 --> 00:53:33.246
Bye!

1298
00:53:35.382 --> 00:53:37.018
We need to get rid
of this fucking wine.

1299
00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:39.787
- What? Why?
- Because we can't afford it.

1300
00:53:39.821 --> 00:53:43.658
- Why?
- Because...

1301
00:53:43.691 --> 00:53:46.594
it's $300 a bottle.

1302
00:53:46.627 --> 00:53:48.328
- What?
- Yeah.

1303
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:50.031
You said that it was 50.

1304
00:53:50.064 --> 00:53:51.866
Because I didn't want you
to get pissed off at me

1305
00:53:51.899 --> 00:53:53.601
for spending $300
on a bottle of wine.

1306
00:53:53.634 --> 00:53:55.435
So, you lied to me.

1307
00:53:55.469 --> 00:53:57.304
I... no.

1308
00:53:57.337 --> 00:53:59.272
No, not doing this right now.
Georges, hi!

1309
00:53:59.306 --> 00:54:01.008
Hi, you know what,
I think my wife is

1310
00:54:01.042 --> 00:54:02.510
actually the one
who made a mistake here.

1311
00:54:02.543 --> 00:54:04.377
We need to return
this wine please.

1312
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:06.413
- Oh, no, we don't do that.
- You don't do what?

1313
00:54:06.446 --> 00:54:08.883
We don't do refunds.

1314
00:54:08.916 --> 00:54:11.485
Okay... okay...

1315
00:54:11.519 --> 00:54:13.453
...we're good...
Look, hey, hey.

1316
00:54:13.487 --> 00:54:15.422
- Yeah?
- I work in sales, okay?

1317
00:54:15.455 --> 00:54:17.357
I get it, right? You gotta get
your nut here, right?

1318
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.326
Okay, no-no-no-no-no.
I got my nut.

1319
00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:21.495
And I got their nut,
and I got your nut,

1320
00:54:21.529 --> 00:54:24.799
and I got all your nuts
all over my face, okay?

1321
00:54:24.832 --> 00:54:27.467
And we still don't do refunds.

1322
00:54:27.502 --> 00:54:28.903
No, wait, look... fuck, come on,

1323
00:54:28.936 --> 00:54:30.772
- come on, hey, hey, look...
- Jack?

1324
00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:32.573
It's still in the box, right?
It's still organic.

1325
00:54:32.607 --> 00:54:34.075
Biodynamic.

1326
00:54:34.108 --> 00:54:35.543
And overpriced.
You can take this back...

1327
00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:37.011
- No, no, that's okay.
- Jack?

1328
00:54:37.044 --> 00:54:38.445
- He needs to take this back!
- Jack!

1329
00:54:38.478 --> 00:54:40.347
What?

1330
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.349
- We have to keep it.
- Why?

1331
00:54:42.382 --> 00:54:44.652
Because we said we would
drink it at dinner tonight.

1332
00:54:46.554 --> 00:54:48.421
Fuck!

1333
00:54:57.899 --> 00:55:00.034
You do not get to be mad
at me about this.

1334
00:55:00.067 --> 00:55:01.803
I don't get to be mad
at you about this.

1335
00:55:01.836 --> 00:55:03.838
- Don't do that, Jack.
- Do what?

1336
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:05.706
- Don't do the thing.
- What thing?

1337
00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.608
- The lawyer thing.
- I'm not doing

1338
00:55:07.642 --> 00:55:10.011
a lawyer thing, I'm just...
making a counterpoint.

1339
00:55:10.044 --> 00:55:12.780
Oh, there it is.

1340
00:55:12.814 --> 00:55:14.816
You lied to me.
It's as simple as that.

1341
00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:18.085
Okay, um, I'd just argue
that I lied to you

1342
00:55:18.119 --> 00:55:20.420
because you're really
embarrassed of me.

1343
00:55:20.453 --> 00:55:22.523
I am not embarrassed of you.

1344
00:55:22.557 --> 00:55:25.526
I... mm, see, you want us
to be these people,

1345
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.129
and we're just not,
and, like, that's okay.

1346
00:55:28.162 --> 00:55:31.464
These people are
miserable and drunks.

1347
00:55:31.498 --> 00:55:33.534
They're drunks?

1348
00:55:33.568 --> 00:55:35.503
They haven't stopped drinking
since we got here.

1349
00:55:35.536 --> 00:55:37.939
- It's her birthday weekend.
- Which she didn't tell you.

1350
00:55:37.972 --> 00:55:40.608
Because she didn't want it
to be weird.

1351
00:55:47.582 --> 00:55:50.417
We are currently
sitting in a car

1352
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.920
that is worth $100,000.

1353
00:55:52.954 --> 00:55:54.722
Inside of that car,

1354
00:55:54.755 --> 00:55:57.725
there is $150,000 worth of wine.

1355
00:56:00.127 --> 00:56:01.996
This is weird.

1356
00:56:11.205 --> 00:56:12.840
Hi.

1357
00:56:12.874 --> 00:56:15.509
- Hey!
- Hi!

1358
00:56:15.543 --> 00:56:17.044
You changed.

1359
00:56:17.078 --> 00:56:19.412
Oh, it's murder mystery night.

1360
00:56:19.446 --> 00:56:21.082
Milton made it
a Roaring '20s theme.

1361
00:56:21.115 --> 00:56:24.085
Oh, um, I just...

1362
00:56:24.118 --> 00:56:25.786
I didn't bring anything to wear.

1363
00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.688
Oh, that's okay,
Milton took care of it all.

1364
00:56:27.722 --> 00:56:29.657
There's some stuff
in your room, go get changed,

1365
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.826
and then come back up here
whenever you're ready,

1366
00:56:31.859 --> 00:56:33.928
and we're all gonna
go down to the farmhouse.

1367
00:56:33.961 --> 00:56:36.731
Okay... oh, we brought the wine.

1368
00:56:36.764 --> 00:56:38.933
- Wine?
- From, um...

1369
00:56:38.966 --> 00:56:42.203
- from the tasting.
- Oh, right!

1370
00:56:42.236 --> 00:56:44.505
Great, um, yeah,
you can just put that

1371
00:56:44.538 --> 00:56:46.207
downstairs in the cellar
and then go get changed.

1372
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.109
We're gonna kill each other!

1373
00:56:48.142 --> 00:56:50.578
Hey, Jack, tonight,

1374
00:56:50.611 --> 00:56:53.080
why don't you pick on a vase
your own size, see?!

1375
00:56:53.114 --> 00:56:55.116
Argh, ya see?

1376
00:57:10.598 --> 00:57:11.832
Well, good thing we bought two.

1377
00:57:11.866 --> 00:57:13.100
Okay.

1378
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:25.212
They know my sizes?
How do they do that?

1379
00:57:25.246 --> 00:57:27.715
God, I want a Milton.

1380
00:57:30.985 --> 00:57:33.688
Listen up!

1381
00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:36.958
It seems there be
a murderer in our midst.

1382
00:57:36.991 --> 00:57:38.225
My name is

1383
00:57:38.259 --> 00:57:40.561
Police Chief Danny O'Sullivan!

1384
00:57:40.594 --> 00:57:42.596
And if there's one thing
I won't stand,

1385
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:45.232
it's murderers in Chicago.

1386
00:57:45.266 --> 00:57:47.134
- Ooh.
- Manila!

1387
00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:50.137
Now, it seems
that someone's been

1388
00:57:50.171 --> 00:57:52.606
feeding me intel on the inside.

1389
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.542
Isn't that right, Becca Brasco?

1390
00:57:54.575 --> 00:57:56.243
Yeah, see?!

1391
00:57:56.277 --> 00:57:57.979
Me and my crew,
we've been taking over

1392
00:57:58.012 --> 00:57:59.680
the South Side, see?!

1393
00:57:59.714 --> 00:58:01.816
When there was one person

1394
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:04.051
standing in our way...

1395
00:58:06.887 --> 00:58:08.155
Jack, that's... that's your turn.

1396
00:58:08.189 --> 00:58:09.590
- Yeah, you go.
- It's your turn.

1397
00:58:09.623 --> 00:58:11.258
- Read the card.
- I just read it?

1398
00:58:11.292 --> 00:58:13.527
- Just read the card.
- Just the card? Okay, um,

1399
00:58:13.561 --> 00:58:14.595
Where did these cards come from?

1400
00:58:14.628 --> 00:58:16.163
"I'm Michael O'Malley

1401
00:58:16.197 --> 00:58:17.865
"from the south side.
My brother Patrick

1402
00:58:17.898 --> 00:58:19.166
- was murdered..."
- Okay, now, Jack, can you

1403
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.002
please commit to the character?

1404
00:58:21.035 --> 00:58:22.636
- Do an accent.
- Can you give a...

1405
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:24.638
It's so freeing
when you just read it

1406
00:58:24.672 --> 00:58:27.008
- with an accent.
- Okay, yeah, okay.

1407
00:58:27.041 --> 00:58:29.176
Okay, um...

1408
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:30.745
"I'm Michael O'Malley

1409
00:58:30.778 --> 00:58:32.146
from the South Side.

1410
00:58:32.179 --> 00:58:35.016
My brother Patrick was murdered.

1411
00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:36.817
People think I did it
to take control

1412
00:58:36.851 --> 00:58:38.686
of the potato trade,

1413
00:58:38.719 --> 00:58:40.121
but that's impossible

1414
00:58:40.154 --> 00:58:41.922
because I was on the north side

1415
00:58:41.956 --> 00:58:44.225
with Don Kerryon..."
that's Kerry.

1416
00:58:44.258 --> 00:58:46.594
Ahh, that's-ah me!

1417
00:58:49.797 --> 00:58:52.867
"While I was on the north side
with Don Ker-Leone!"

1418
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.069
True, true, that is true.

1419
00:58:55.102 --> 00:58:57.805
Because there's not
one person in this room

1420
00:58:57.838 --> 00:59:00.875
that didn't stand to gain
from Patrick's death.

1421
00:59:00.908 --> 00:59:03.744
Especially the wife!

1422
00:59:07.748 --> 00:59:09.183
Let's just pick up the cues.

1423
00:59:09.216 --> 00:59:10.785
Just pick up the cues, everyone.

1424
00:59:10.818 --> 00:59:12.253
- Seriously, take this.
- Becca was

1425
00:59:12.286 --> 00:59:13.821
a Fulbright scholar.
She's completely

1426
00:59:13.854 --> 00:59:15.756
wasting her life here.

1427
00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:17.825
- Love you, Becky.
- Okay, sorry, Becca.

1428
00:59:17.858 --> 00:59:19.126
Total respect.

1429
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.961
Yeah, that's embarrassing.

1430
00:59:20.995 --> 00:59:22.596
You got it, babe, go.

1431
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:23.864
- You got it.
- "It couldn't've been me.

1432
00:59:23.898 --> 00:59:25.699
I loved my husband.

1433
00:59:25.733 --> 00:59:28.102
We immigrated here
together from Kilkenny.

1434
00:59:28.135 --> 00:59:30.137
On that ride
across the Atlantic,

1435
00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:31.772
we would talk about
the better life

1436
00:59:31.806 --> 00:59:33.607
America would show us.

1437
00:59:33.641 --> 00:59:36.343
We heard that there are
no cats in America,

1438
00:59:36.377 --> 00:59:38.979
and the streets are
made of cheese.

1439
00:59:39.013 --> 00:59:40.815
- Is she going off script?
- Yeah, it's brilliant.

1440
00:59:40.848 --> 00:59:43.350
"Upon arriving in New York,

1441
00:59:43.384 --> 00:59:45.286
- Patrick took me in his..."
- Chicago! Chicago.

1442
00:59:45.319 --> 00:59:49.123
"... Chicago, Patrick took me
in his arms and said,

1443
00:59:49.156 --> 00:59:52.126
We will never want
for anything again."

1444
00:59:52.159 --> 00:59:55.629
And then one of you monsters
murdered him!

1445
01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:02.837
Wow!

1446
01:00:14.782 --> 01:00:16.183
Ooh!

1447
01:00:26.827 --> 01:00:29.163
Dude's got cryptocurrency.
Secret currency.

1448
01:00:29.196 --> 01:00:31.332
Right? It's just...
It's an idea.

1449
01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:33.234
Where do we put the crypto?

1450
01:00:33.267 --> 01:00:36.170
In storage.
Is it a fuckin' crypto bank?

1451
01:00:36.203 --> 01:00:38.772
- I don't know yet.
- You all right, bud?

1452
01:00:38.806 --> 01:00:40.774
I'm just in a dark...
A dark hole right now.

1453
01:00:40.808 --> 01:00:42.143
Come here, come here,
come here, come here...

1454
01:00:42.176 --> 01:00:43.777
Then come sit,
come sit, come sit.

1455
01:00:43.811 --> 01:00:46.046
This is how we come out

1456
01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.682
the other side.
He goes in here...

1457
01:00:48.716 --> 01:00:50.784
Just give it... watch,

1458
01:00:50.818 --> 01:00:56.257
watch, five, four,
three, two, one.

1459
01:00:58.359 --> 01:01:00.327
What's up, guys?
All right.

1460
01:01:00.361 --> 01:01:02.196
So what you're gonna want
is you're gonna want

1461
01:01:02.229 --> 01:01:04.031
cold storage,
cold storage can make it

1462
01:01:04.064 --> 01:01:05.733
so it can't be encrypted
by other people.

1463
01:01:05.766 --> 01:01:07.168
- That's it right there.
- So you have a pass code

1464
01:01:07.201 --> 01:01:09.170
which is gonna break it up...

1465
01:01:09.203 --> 01:01:12.139
And the Boner Award...

1466
01:01:12.173 --> 01:01:15.176
...for Worst Job

1467
01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:17.211
Keeping Their Facts
Straight goes to...

1468
01:01:17.244 --> 01:01:18.412
Oh, I know who that is.

1469
01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:20.147
Jack!

1470
01:01:21.749 --> 01:01:24.151
Yay, Jack!

1471
01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:26.220
Ah... ah!

1472
01:01:26.253 --> 01:01:28.956
Uh... fuck you.

1473
01:01:30.491 --> 01:01:32.259
You have to use that, Jack.

1474
01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:35.462
He's a good sport...
And last but not least,

1475
01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:37.498
the award for Finest Performance

1476
01:01:37.532 --> 01:01:40.100
goes to...

1477
01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:44.738
Lindsay!

1478
01:01:44.772 --> 01:01:47.041
Oh, my God!

1479
01:01:47.074 --> 01:01:48.742
I would like to thank
all of you, blah-blah-blah,

1480
01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:51.111
this is amazing!

1481
01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:55.216
Oh, my God, of course
you think Lindz gave

1482
01:01:55.249 --> 01:01:57.218
the best performance.

1483
01:01:57.251 --> 01:01:59.086
What are you talking about?
Lindz was great.

1484
01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:01.055
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, she's amazing.

1485
01:02:01.088 --> 01:02:03.958
I... Becca was...
Pfft! wet.

1486
01:02:03.991 --> 01:02:08.295
But-But Daniel knows Lindz
from high school, so...

1487
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:10.231
She rocked it,
she was in all the plays.

1488
01:02:10.264 --> 01:02:11.932
I think he's a little biased.

1489
01:02:11.966 --> 01:02:13.867
Wait, high school?

1490
01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:15.936
- Yeah.
- Daniel...

1491
01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:18.772
Daniel and Lindz went
to high school together.

1492
01:02:18.806 --> 01:02:20.941
And they used to,
you know, they used to...

1493
01:02:20.975 --> 01:02:23.010
- Cat.
- ...whatever.

1494
01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:26.180
- Oh.
- They used to what?

1495
01:02:26.213 --> 01:02:29.416
No, well, we just... we went
to high school together.

1496
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:32.019
It's not a big deal.
You knew that.

1497
01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:35.055
I didn't.
I didn't know that, Dan.

1498
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:37.324
Oh... yeah, well...

1499
01:02:37.358 --> 01:02:38.959
oh.

1500
01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.096
Dan?

1501
01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:46.033
Dan...

1502
01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:48.836
Dan, oh...

1503
01:02:48.869 --> 01:02:52.473
- you're Dan.
- Yeah, brother.

1504
01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:03.217
May I speak to you privately
over there please?

1505
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.252
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

1506
01:03:07.288 --> 01:03:09.923
Uh, anybody want

1507
01:03:09.957 --> 01:03:11.825
- a refill?
- Blue penis.

1508
01:03:11.859 --> 01:03:14.128
- Over here.
- Babe, they called him

1509
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:16.564
Big Dick Dan 'cause
he's very well-endowed.

1510
01:03:16.598 --> 01:03:18.600
Oh! Brother Dan's

1511
01:03:18.633 --> 01:03:20.934
packing a real ham cannon, huh?

1512
01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:22.870
I see that for Dan, yeah.

1513
01:03:22.903 --> 01:03:25.205
But it's, like, a...
It's like a thing for Jack

1514
01:03:25.239 --> 01:03:27.207
because he doesn't have...
Well, he's...

1515
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:28.576
'Cause... 'Cause,
is Jack not packing

1516
01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:30.444
- a ham cannon?
- No, he has...

1517
01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:32.346
Is that Big Dick Dan?

1518
01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:33.548
- Okay, can we just...
- No, yes or no question.

1519
01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:34.948
Is that Big Dick Dan?

1520
01:03:36.651 --> 01:03:37.918
Yes.

1521
01:03:40.622 --> 01:03:43.290
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

1522
01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:45.426
Okay.

1523
01:03:45.459 --> 01:03:47.995
I am not going to point out

1524
01:03:48.028 --> 01:03:49.531
that you just ripped me
a new asshole in the car

1525
01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:51.332
for lying to you
about a bottle of wine.

1526
01:03:51.365 --> 01:03:54.201
I... but you kind of are

1527
01:03:54.234 --> 01:03:56.937
by saying that, so...

1528
01:03:58.205 --> 01:03:59.907
That is fair.

1529
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.577
So I'm not gonna do that.

1530
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:04.878
And I am not gonna freak out

1531
01:04:04.912 --> 01:04:07.582
- now that I have met Dan.
- Which, Jack, honey,

1532
01:04:07.615 --> 01:04:09.883
that really was so long ago.

1533
01:04:09.917 --> 01:04:12.319
And it's great that you
wouldn't freak out about it

1534
01:04:12.353 --> 01:04:15.989
because it was another person,
it was another time, you know?

1535
01:04:16.023 --> 01:04:17.324
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Okay.

1536
01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:19.093
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

1537
01:04:19.126 --> 01:04:21.161
So I'm just gonna...

1538
01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:24.064
I'm just gonna push this,
like, deep...

1539
01:04:24.098 --> 01:04:25.933
deep...

1540
01:04:25.966 --> 01:04:29.103
- down inside...
- Okay.

1541
01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:30.371
And we are just
gonna deal with this

1542
01:04:30.404 --> 01:04:32.139
when we get home, okay?

1543
01:04:34.007 --> 01:04:36.410
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1544
01:04:42.116 --> 01:04:43.618
I am so sorry.

1545
01:04:43.651 --> 01:04:46.621
Thanks, Cat.
Not your fault.

1546
01:04:57.732 --> 01:04:59.567
Actually, I didn't know that,

1547
01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:02.537
but I don't care.

1548
01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:07.441
And after hearing about
Daniel and his ham cannon,

1549
01:05:07.474 --> 01:05:08.710
I'm probably gonna
have sex with him, too.

1550
01:05:08.743 --> 01:05:10.411
Is that okay with you, Ker?

1551
01:05:10.444 --> 01:05:12.580
I seriously do not care.

1552
01:05:12.614 --> 01:05:14.682
And I'm not judging anyone here.

1553
01:05:14.716 --> 01:05:16.183
That's beautiful, brother.

1554
01:05:17.985 --> 01:05:19.987
I mean, at the end of the day,

1555
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.289
it's just sex, right?

1556
01:05:22.322 --> 01:05:24.559
Yes, I've had sex
with your wife,

1557
01:05:24.592 --> 01:05:28.128
and I've had sex with Becca.

1558
01:05:28.162 --> 01:05:30.464
And it sounds like I'm gonna
have sex with Carrie.

1559
01:05:32.433 --> 01:05:35.102
And that's awesome.

1560
01:05:35.135 --> 01:05:37.371
But what you have, brother,

1561
01:05:37.404 --> 01:05:39.574
that's deeper than penetration.

1562
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:43.010
You have a life.

1563
01:05:43.043 --> 01:05:44.478
And I think it's a great honor

1564
01:05:44.512 --> 01:05:46.313
to be bonded like this
to another man.

1565
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:49.517
Look... Lindsay taught me

1566
01:05:49.551 --> 01:05:51.485
so much about sex,
and I taught her

1567
01:05:51.519 --> 01:05:53.555
a bunch of cool stuff, too.

1568
01:05:53.588 --> 01:05:55.690
And you're still reaping
those benefits today.

1569
01:05:55.723 --> 01:05:57.525
So...

1570
01:05:57.559 --> 01:05:59.393
thank you.

1571
01:05:59.426 --> 01:06:01.395
And you're welcome.

1572
01:06:01.428 --> 01:06:03.230
I'm welcome?

1573
01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:05.499
Yeah.
I mean, obviously,

1574
01:06:05.533 --> 01:06:07.468
we're gonna have
different experiences

1575
01:06:07.502 --> 01:06:08.703
because we have
different body types.

1576
01:06:08.736 --> 01:06:10.505
You're shorter than I am.

1577
01:06:10.538 --> 01:06:12.406
I'm... are you saying
I'm smaller than you?

1578
01:06:12.439 --> 01:06:14.174
Yeah, well, you're like five...

1579
01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:15.577
What the fuck is that

1580
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.512
- supposed to mean?
- Jack?

1581
01:06:17.545 --> 01:06:19.413
- It's okay, brother.
- ...I'm smaller than you?

1582
01:06:19.446 --> 01:06:21.114
I'm fucking shorter than you?
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1583
01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:22.784
- this is very...
- Triggering?

1584
01:06:22.817 --> 01:06:24.619
Thank you, Ker,
not really the time right now.

1585
01:06:24.652 --> 01:06:26.253
- Sounds like we just got...
- Don't touch me, man!

1586
01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:28.021
Jack!

1587
01:06:28.055 --> 01:06:29.624
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?

1588
01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:31.726
- Give me that!
- No... whoa... no, no!

1589
01:06:33.628 --> 01:06:35.429
Take his power!
Grab it!

1590
01:06:38.398 --> 01:06:40.735
- Time out!
- Careful! Careful!

1591
01:06:42.369 --> 01:06:44.639
Oh! Oh!

1592
01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:46.708
Please!
I wanna stop!

1593
01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:49.276
I wanna stop!
I wanna stop! Please stop.

1594
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:52.412
- I wanna... yes!
- Aah.

1595
01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:54.616
Well, my thirst for blood
remains unquenched.

1596
01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:56.584
Yeah, yeah... hey, fellas,

1597
01:06:56.618 --> 01:06:58.485
this is getting
"hard-on" to watch.

1598
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.054
I have lower back issues.

1599
01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:02.590
Oh, me too, man.

1600
01:07:02.624 --> 01:07:04.258
And the winner
of the weirdest fight

1601
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:06.628
in history...
is Jack!

1602
01:07:09.664 --> 01:07:12.366
Oh, God.

1603
01:07:14.802 --> 01:07:16.571
- Lindsay?
- Dan?!

1604
01:07:16.604 --> 01:07:19.139
You get the fuck outta here now!

1605
01:07:19.172 --> 01:07:21.709
Go upstairs, go to bed.

1606
01:07:21.743 --> 01:07:23.410
Think about what you did.

1607
01:07:23.443 --> 01:07:26.113
Goddamn it.
I'll see you in the morning.

1608
01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:27.849
Hey, thank you for
all your hard work tonight,

1609
01:07:27.882 --> 01:07:29.483
by the way.
Thank you very much.

1610
01:07:29.517 --> 01:07:30.785
I'll see you upstairs, Dan.

1611
01:07:30.818 --> 01:07:32.754
Excellent storytelling.

1612
01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.354
- That guy's the best.
- Really lovely.

1613
01:07:34.388 --> 01:07:35.723
That was impressive.

1614
01:07:35.757 --> 01:07:37.257
He is the fucking best, man.

1615
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.667
- Why are you sad?
- Because...

1616
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.703
Jack was doing so much better.

1617
01:07:48.736 --> 01:07:52.472
You know?

1618
01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:55.409
But he won the fight.

1619
01:07:55.442 --> 01:07:57.311
Oh, my God.

1620
01:07:57.344 --> 01:07:59.681
He's gonna actually go to jail.

1621
01:07:59.714 --> 01:08:01.883
- Why?
- Because

1622
01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:04.451
he assaulted Dan,

1623
01:08:04.484 --> 01:08:06.219
and Dan's gonna press charges.

1624
01:08:06.253 --> 01:08:08.322
Oh, no, he won't.

1625
01:08:08.355 --> 01:08:11.893
Daniel has signed
multiple NDAs...

1626
01:08:11.926 --> 01:08:15.162
and he gets asshole tax

1627
01:08:15.195 --> 01:08:17.264
every time something
like this happens.

1628
01:08:17.297 --> 01:08:18.866
Oh, what is asshole tax?

1629
01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:22.770
Daniel and Becca get
an extra ten grand

1630
01:08:22.804 --> 01:08:25.840
every time my husband or a guest

1631
01:08:25.873 --> 01:08:28.408
is an asshole.

1632
01:08:28.442 --> 01:08:30.277
Wow.

1633
01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:31.779
This happens a lot.

1634
01:08:33.581 --> 01:08:35.148
- Okay.
- He makes

1635
01:08:35.182 --> 01:08:37.150
way too much money to try to...

1636
01:08:37.184 --> 01:08:39.787
Yeah.

1637
01:08:41.188 --> 01:08:42.389
I'm gonna get my...

1638
01:08:42.422 --> 01:08:43.858
my girl.

1639
01:08:43.891 --> 01:08:45.760
My girl, Gigi.

1640
01:08:45.793 --> 01:08:47.494
- Gigi?
- Yeah.

1641
01:08:47.528 --> 01:08:49.564
She is the solution.

1642
01:08:49.597 --> 01:08:52.165
- Gigi is the solution?
- She's a witch.

1643
01:08:52.199 --> 01:08:54.401
She's a good witch.

1644
01:08:57.739 --> 01:08:59.574
I have to go to bed.

1645
01:09:02.577 --> 01:09:05.747
Good night.

1646
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:09.717
God, I hate you.

1647
01:09:09.751 --> 01:09:12.954
That's okay.
I suck.

1648
01:09:12.987 --> 01:09:16.691
Well, you took the fun
right out of that.

1649
01:09:16.724 --> 01:09:19.961
Here, let me carry you
to bed, come on.

1650
01:09:44.519 --> 01:09:46.821
Oh! Oh!

1651
01:09:49.824 --> 01:09:52.259
Ow, why'd you kick me?

1652
01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:53.895
She does that.

1653
01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:57.464
- Why were you on the floor?
- I... I guess

1654
01:09:57.497 --> 01:09:58.733
I didn't wanna wake
you guys up? I don't...

1655
01:10:01.969 --> 01:10:03.738
- Hey, Dan.
- Yeah, brother?

1656
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:05.606
I'm sorry about last night, man.

1657
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.241
No hard feelings, brother.
I'm sorry, too.

1658
01:10:10.678 --> 01:10:12.880
"The lady of the house
requests your presence

1659
01:10:12.914 --> 01:10:15.415
"in the grace garden
for a healing cacao ceremony

1660
01:10:15.449 --> 01:10:17.284
at 10:00 am."

1661
01:10:17.317 --> 01:10:19.587
Why is she in our bed?

1662
01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.689
I don't know, Jack, why?
Do you wanna fight her, too?

1663
01:10:21.723 --> 01:10:23.423
No, I don't...

1664
01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:28.830
Fuck!

1665
01:10:28.863 --> 01:10:30.998
How do these people
fucking live like this?

1666
01:10:31.032 --> 01:10:32.667
- It's...
- Jack...

1667
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.002
What the fuck happened
last night?

1668
01:10:35.036 --> 01:10:37.437
Jack, grow the fuck up.

1669
01:10:37.471 --> 01:10:39.372
You could've gone to jail again.

1670
01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:41.274
- I didn't go...
- I'm going to get coffee.

1671
01:10:52.787 --> 01:10:54.522
Hi.

1672
01:10:54.555 --> 01:10:56.557
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1673
01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:58.826
Uh, listen, I...

1674
01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.862
I just wanted to talk to you
about last night.

1675
01:11:00.895 --> 01:11:04.766
I'm really sorry, and I just...

1676
01:11:04.799 --> 01:11:08.569
I don't know, I just feel
like it was so...

1677
01:11:08.603 --> 01:11:10.571
Very avoidable.

1678
01:11:10.605 --> 01:11:12.840
Um...

1679
01:11:12.874 --> 01:11:15.442
yeah, yeah, I mean,
I... definitely

1680
01:11:15.475 --> 01:11:17.310
could've talked to Jack sooner.

1681
01:11:17.344 --> 01:11:18.679
Or you could've not told me.

1682
01:11:20.413 --> 01:11:22.984
Right.

1683
01:11:23.017 --> 01:11:25.418
There's an espresso
if you want coffee.

1684
01:11:27.722 --> 01:11:29.690
Okay.

1685
01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.903
What the fuck?

1686
01:11:49.076 --> 01:11:52.513
Oh, goddamn it!

1687
01:11:59.419 --> 01:12:01.556
You must be Lindz.

1688
01:12:01.589 --> 01:12:03.991
I've heard about you.

1689
01:12:04.025 --> 01:12:05.960
I'm sorry,
have we... have we met?

1690
01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:09.096
I'm Gigi.
Catherine's shaman.

1691
01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:11.431
I'm really looking forward to...

1692
01:12:11.464 --> 01:12:13.400
healing together today.

1693
01:12:18.139 --> 01:12:19.807
Mars...

1694
01:12:19.841 --> 01:12:21.909
is the god of war.

1695
01:12:21.943 --> 01:12:25.146
Scorpio is the sign of the self.

1696
01:12:27.582 --> 01:12:29.116
You're at war with yourself.

1697
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:32.687
But...

1698
01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.421
we can work on that together.

1699
01:12:34.454 --> 01:12:35.890
Today.

1700
01:12:48.769 --> 01:12:50.370
See you in the garden.

1701
01:13:21.602 --> 01:13:24.038
I am incredibly honored
to be sitting with you all

1702
01:13:24.071 --> 01:13:26.841
in intention today...

1703
01:13:26.874 --> 01:13:28.609
at this cacao ceremony.

1704
01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:34.115
Please take a moment
to thank yourself...

1705
01:13:34.148 --> 01:13:36.449
Thank you.

1706
01:13:36.483 --> 01:13:37.919
And please thank one another

1707
01:13:37.952 --> 01:13:39.854
for sharing this time together.

1708
01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:43.691
Thank you.

1709
01:13:43.724 --> 01:13:47.494
We are trying to connect
on a deeper level,

1710
01:13:47.528 --> 01:13:49.163
on a human level,

1711
01:13:49.196 --> 01:13:51.933
so we can see each other.

1712
01:13:51.966 --> 01:13:56.037
We have already created
our sacred space.

1713
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:59.540
We each have our own
individual bowls of cacao.

1714
01:13:59.573 --> 01:14:01.108
Take a sip of the cacao, please,

1715
01:14:01.142 --> 01:14:02.944
as you're sitting
with your intention.

1716
01:14:06.147 --> 01:14:10.117
This world is
such a crazy place.

1717
01:14:10.151 --> 01:14:12.954
So... hectic.

1718
01:14:12.987 --> 01:14:17.692
So... ego... ic.

1719
01:14:17.725 --> 01:14:19.694
We spend all of this time

1720
01:14:19.727 --> 01:14:22.196
traveling
through all these years,

1721
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:25.633
trying to get
to a certain place of hope,

1722
01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:29.637
up this hill, to a destination?

1723
01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:32.173
And then we wake up
in the morning,

1724
01:14:32.206 --> 01:14:35.076
and we step outside.

1725
01:14:35.109 --> 01:14:36.844
We take a deep breath,

1726
01:14:36.877 --> 01:14:39.680
or we just... we get really high.

1727
01:14:41.916 --> 01:14:44.652
When we want
to really be yelling,

1728
01:14:44.685 --> 01:14:46.721
at the top of our lungs,

1729
01:14:46.754 --> 01:14:50.591
"Hey!
What's going on?!"

1730
01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:53.527
Wouldn't it be incredible

1731
01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:56.197
if you could just turn
to your partner

1732
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:58.699
and say...

1733
01:14:58.733 --> 01:15:01.168
"Do you know what I want?
What I really, really want?"

1734
01:15:01.202 --> 01:15:03.170
And they could look at you,
and they would know

1735
01:15:03.204 --> 01:15:05.139
exactly what you want,
what you really,

1736
01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:07.675
really wanted,
because it's a safe space.

1737
01:15:07.708 --> 01:15:09.610
And you could tell them,

1738
01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:11.679
without any stuttering,
no "I want, uh,

1739
01:15:11.712 --> 01:15:13.647
I may want, uh..."

1740
01:15:13.681 --> 01:15:15.683
You know what you really,
really want.

1741
01:15:15.716 --> 01:15:17.685
They know.

1742
01:15:18.919 --> 01:15:21.322
You both want to be...

1743
01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:23.691
friends.

1744
01:15:23.724 --> 01:15:25.993
Possibly lovers.

1745
01:15:27.762 --> 01:15:29.964
But you wanna be seen.

1746
01:15:29.997 --> 01:15:31.999
Yes? Yes.

1747
01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:33.567
Yes.

1748
01:15:35.369 --> 01:15:37.304
Please take another sip
of the cacao.

1749
01:15:40.741 --> 01:15:42.610
Please repeat after me.

1750
01:15:42.643 --> 01:15:44.812
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1751
01:15:44.845 --> 01:15:46.647
Please forgive me.

1752
01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.283
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1753
01:15:49.316 --> 01:15:51.052
Please forgive me.

1754
01:15:51.085 --> 01:15:54.688
I love you. I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

1755
01:15:54.722 --> 01:15:57.124
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1756
01:15:57.158 --> 01:15:59.060
Please forgive me.

1757
01:15:59.093 --> 01:16:03.130
I love you. I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

1758
01:16:03.164 --> 01:16:06.100
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1759
01:16:06.133 --> 01:16:08.302
- Please forgive me.
- Again!

1760
01:16:08.335 --> 01:16:10.805
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1761
01:16:10.838 --> 01:16:12.840
- Please forgive me.
- Again!

1762
01:16:12.873 --> 01:16:15.042
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1763
01:16:15.076 --> 01:16:16.343
Please forgive me.

1764
01:16:17.912 --> 01:16:20.981
Thank you.

1765
01:16:21.015 --> 01:16:23.317
Now that we are done
with the cacao ceremony,

1766
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:25.953
I would like to invite
you all to take a moment

1767
01:16:25.986 --> 01:16:28.722
to dance with me in intention.

1768
01:16:40.134 --> 01:16:41.936
Yes.

1769
01:16:41.969 --> 01:16:44.271
Think about your heart.

1770
01:16:44.305 --> 01:16:46.273
What is it feeling?
Is it a give?

1771
01:16:46.307 --> 01:16:48.275
Is it a take?
Are you taking too much?

1772
01:16:48.309 --> 01:16:50.177
Do not be shy.

1773
01:16:50.211 --> 01:16:52.012
Explore what love means for you.

1774
01:16:52.046 --> 01:16:55.649
Nothing is wrong,
everything is right.

1775
01:16:55.683 --> 01:16:58.152
We're not dancing,
love is moving us.

1776
01:16:58.185 --> 01:16:59.954
Incredible.

1777
01:16:59.987 --> 01:17:01.856
Powerful group here.

1778
01:17:01.889 --> 01:17:04.725
Be intentional.
This is what I wanna see.

1779
01:17:04.758 --> 01:17:07.194
Are you guys feeling this?
I am just so overcome

1780
01:17:07.228 --> 01:17:10.364
with the whirlwind of love

1781
01:17:39.894 --> 01:17:41.962
Mmm...

1782
01:17:41.996 --> 01:17:44.231
so, let's continue.

1783
01:17:44.265 --> 01:17:46.066
From the front
of the house are...

1784
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.902
- The Pinot.
- Pinot which?

1785
01:17:47.935 --> 01:17:49.270
- Noir.
- Good.

1786
01:17:49.303 --> 01:17:51.172
Good, good, good.

1787
01:17:51.205 --> 01:17:52.840
And what's behind the house?

1788
01:17:52.873 --> 01:17:54.375
- The shiraz.
- Very close.

1789
01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:56.076
It's actually syrah.

1790
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:57.478
But you know
what's kind of funny?

1791
01:17:57.512 --> 01:17:59.380
- It's the same thing.
- What?

1792
01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:01.115
Shiraz is just...

1793
01:18:01.148 --> 01:18:03.017
Australian syrah,
but the French don't like

1794
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:04.485
the Australians,
so they were like,

1795
01:18:04.519 --> 01:18:06.187
no, you can...

1796
01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.322
You can call it "syrah,"
and they were like,

1797
01:18:08.355 --> 01:18:09.990
"Well, what do we call it?"

1798
01:18:10.024 --> 01:18:11.825
And they were like, "You call it

1799
01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:13.260
whatever you want,
but not syrah,"

1800
01:18:13.294 --> 01:18:15.429
and they were like,
"Fine, we'll...

1801
01:18:15.462 --> 01:18:17.231
we'll call it shiraz."

1802
01:18:21.268 --> 01:18:23.370
It's the same thing
as sauvi B and Saint Cyr,

1803
01:18:23.404 --> 01:18:25.039
it's just a marketing
question, you know?

1804
01:18:25.072 --> 01:18:27.341
Yeah...

1805
01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:29.944
- Oh, man.
- You are great, man.

1806
01:18:29.977 --> 01:18:32.112
- Thanks, man.
- No, like,

1807
01:18:32.146 --> 01:18:34.481
I cannot wait
to get to know you better.

1808
01:18:34.516 --> 01:18:36.450
When are we gonna do that?

1809
01:18:36.483 --> 01:18:38.953
You know, with Cat
and Lindsay working together,

1810
01:18:38.986 --> 01:18:40.254
we may hang out all the time.

1811
01:18:40.287 --> 01:18:42.756
- They are?
- Yeah, remember?

1812
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:44.758
At brunch, she said
you'd fund the thing.

1813
01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:47.861
Oh, my God, so much has
happened this weekend.

1814
01:18:47.895 --> 01:18:49.496
- I know.
- What's the company?

1815
01:18:49.531 --> 01:18:51.332
Sustainable clothing something.

1816
01:18:51.365 --> 01:18:53.867
Oh, that's a pretty good idea.

1817
01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:55.169
Can I hit you with a truth bomb?

1818
01:18:55.202 --> 01:18:56.470
Blow it up.

1819
01:18:56.504 --> 01:18:58.205
Don't let Lindz...

1820
01:18:58.239 --> 01:19:00.007
get involved with Cat.

1821
01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.276
And don't... And don't
you get involved

1822
01:19:02.309 --> 01:19:03.978
with Cat, either.

1823
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:06.180
Why?

1824
01:19:07.948 --> 01:19:09.517
Cat is my wife

1825
01:19:09.551 --> 01:19:12.186
and my raison d'etre

1826
01:19:12.219 --> 01:19:15.122
and my light
and my path forward,

1827
01:19:15.155 --> 01:19:17.024
and all of that,
so if she ever hears

1828
01:19:17.057 --> 01:19:18.492
that I said this,
I will deny it to the hill,

1829
01:19:18.526 --> 01:19:20.094
then I'll say
that you were fucked up

1830
01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:22.263
and made it up, but...

1831
01:19:22.296 --> 01:19:24.365
Cat's kind of a...

1832
01:19:24.398 --> 01:19:27.901
an experience hoarder.

1833
01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:31.338
And she loves to feel
like a patron

1834
01:19:31.372 --> 01:19:33.474
of the arts.

1835
01:19:33.508 --> 01:19:37.878
Like a de' Medici from Italy
in the Renaissance,

1836
01:19:37.911 --> 01:19:39.446
but this is the problem, right?

1837
01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.483
Is that she holds on
to these experiences,

1838
01:19:42.517 --> 01:19:44.084
and if you try to take 'em
away, she's like,

1839
01:19:44.118 --> 01:19:46.220
"No! This is my stuff!"

1840
01:19:48.055 --> 01:19:49.490
And she forgets
that there's people

1841
01:19:49.524 --> 01:19:51.225
on the other end
of those experiences,

1842
01:19:51.258 --> 01:19:54.161
and those people inevitably
end up on the...

1843
01:19:54.194 --> 01:19:57.231
on the trash pile of her hoard.

1844
01:19:57.264 --> 01:20:00.502
And I don't want that
to happen to you and Lindz.

1845
01:20:00.535 --> 01:20:02.369
I mean, just...
Let me just... let me just

1846
01:20:02.403 --> 01:20:04.071
throw something out at you
here, do you know that,

1847
01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:05.939
last year, I was funding

1848
01:20:05.973 --> 01:20:08.309
three nonprofit
theater companies in Astoria,

1849
01:20:08.342 --> 01:20:10.944
one alpaca farm in Argentina...

1850
01:20:12.379 --> 01:20:16.050
and two equestrian academies

1851
01:20:16.083 --> 01:20:18.319
in Atlanta and Austin,

1852
01:20:18.352 --> 01:20:19.987
and that... that was just because

1853
01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.589
she liked the A sounds
back to back.

1854
01:20:21.623 --> 01:20:23.424
- It's called assonance.
- Really?

1855
01:20:23.457 --> 01:20:24.925
Yeah.

1856
01:20:26.427 --> 01:20:29.129
Fuck, there is a word
for everything.

1857
01:20:30.097 --> 01:20:32.866
But this is
what I'm saying, okay?

1858
01:20:34.368 --> 01:20:36.870
Cat doesn't follow through.

1859
01:20:36.904 --> 01:20:39.239
All of those businesses
I just mentioned?

1860
01:20:40.642 --> 01:20:42.309
Guess where they are.

1861
01:20:43.678 --> 01:20:47.515
I don't know.

1862
01:20:47.549 --> 01:20:49.316
That... That's them not existing.

1863
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:51.485
They don't exist anymore.
They all went under

1864
01:20:51.519 --> 01:20:53.320
because Cat got bored with them.

1865
01:20:54.388 --> 01:20:55.923
Yeah.

1866
01:20:58.225 --> 01:21:00.327
Cat thinks I lack compassion.

1867
01:21:02.262 --> 01:21:04.532
But she only thinks that

1868
01:21:04.566 --> 01:21:07.000
because I make so much money.

1869
01:21:07.034 --> 01:21:09.136
Just because
I make a lot of money

1870
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:11.506
does not therefore mean
I lack compassion, right?

1871
01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:15.476
Right, Jack?
I need you to say "right."

1872
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:19.179
Yeah, right, no.

1873
01:21:19.213 --> 01:21:22.116
My biggest fear is that

1874
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:23.984
Cat's only with me
because I make

1875
01:21:24.017 --> 01:21:26.353
such a fuck ton of money.

1876
01:21:26.387 --> 01:21:28.455
- Fuck.
- Does that sound

1877
01:21:28.489 --> 01:21:30.157
like somebody
who lacks compassion?

1878
01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:33.528
No, I think you feel
a lot of stuff.

1879
01:21:33.561 --> 01:21:36.230
Thank you.
Thank you, yes.

1880
01:21:36.263 --> 01:21:37.965
- I do.
- Can I...

1881
01:21:37.998 --> 01:21:39.266
Can I tell you something?

1882
01:21:39.299 --> 01:21:40.968
God, I wish you would.

1883
01:21:42.637 --> 01:21:44.304
I'm afraid Lindsay's
gonna leave me

1884
01:21:44.338 --> 01:21:46.541
because I don't
make enough money.

1885
01:21:46.574 --> 01:21:48.342
That's like the yin to my yang.

1886
01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.177
She wants me
to ask you about a job.

1887
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:51.979
Do you want a job?

1888
01:21:52.012 --> 01:21:53.380
I don't know, doing what?

1889
01:21:53.414 --> 01:21:55.082
Well, what do you wanna do?

1890
01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.222
I don't know what I wanna do.

1891
01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.462
Then why would
I have a job for you, my man?

1892
01:22:10.264 --> 01:22:11.699
You know?

1893
01:22:14.334 --> 01:22:18.205
My advice... My advice, Jack,

1894
01:22:18.238 --> 01:22:20.508
you just... you figure out
what you wanna do.

1895
01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:24.111
And you go do it.

1896
01:22:24.144 --> 01:22:26.079
We're not really silly anymore.

1897
01:22:26.113 --> 01:22:29.016
We're not silly people.
We're so serious.

1898
01:22:29.049 --> 01:22:30.984
Daniel, I'm sorry,

1899
01:22:31.018 --> 01:22:33.153
but your... your fingers
feel like worms,

1900
01:22:33.187 --> 01:22:34.988
and if we just take
a quick little break...

1901
01:22:35.022 --> 01:22:37.357
I feel like I'm getting
buried in the dirt.

1902
01:22:37.391 --> 01:22:40.160
- Absolutely.
- Thanks, Becca.

1903
01:22:40.194 --> 01:22:44.164
- Ugh, Lindz...
- Hmm?

1904
01:22:44.198 --> 01:22:47.000
Not to be serious, but...

1905
01:22:47.034 --> 01:22:48.268
we gotta talk about the line.

1906
01:22:48.302 --> 01:22:50.738
Yes.

1907
01:22:50.772 --> 01:22:53.240
Okay, okay:
local, sustainable.

1908
01:22:53.273 --> 01:22:55.710
Local, sustainable,
and, yeah, I'm, like,

1909
01:22:55.743 --> 01:22:59.614
I'm thinking about, like,
textures and patterns.

1910
01:22:59.647 --> 01:23:02.650
- Mm.
- And... choreography

1911
01:23:02.684 --> 01:23:05.152
and rhythms and emotions
and thoughts.

1912
01:23:05.185 --> 01:23:07.755
Well, hemp is overdone.

1913
01:23:07.789 --> 01:23:09.524
- Completely.
- Mm-hmm.

1914
01:23:09.557 --> 01:23:11.425
- Couldn't agree more.
- Something strong.

1915
01:23:11.458 --> 01:23:14.796
Yeah, strong like, um...

1916
01:23:14.829 --> 01:23:17.231
- trees... mm.
- Mm.

1917
01:23:17.264 --> 01:23:18.800
Could we make it out of bark?

1918
01:23:18.833 --> 01:23:21.068
I don't know that
I've seen that done before.

1919
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:23.270
Mm-mm... hmm.

1920
01:23:23.303 --> 01:23:25.038
You're right, yeah,
no, that's a...

1921
01:23:25.072 --> 01:23:26.541
That's a bad idea.

1922
01:23:26.574 --> 01:23:28.375
That one was the mushrooms.

1923
01:23:28.408 --> 01:23:29.611
I may have gotten

1924
01:23:29.644 --> 01:23:31.278
too much mushrooms.

1925
01:23:31.311 --> 01:23:34.281
- Too much mushrooms.
- Too much.

1926
01:23:34.314 --> 01:23:35.683
- Wait, what?
- Too much.

1927
01:23:35.717 --> 01:23:38.686
We were supposed to micro-dose.

1928
01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.054
- Micro-dose?
- Mm, yeah.

1929
01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:42.757
That's where you do, like,
a little bit of...

1930
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:44.692
a little bit of mushrooms
over a sustained period

1931
01:23:44.726 --> 01:23:46.326
so you... you don't get, like,

1932
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.395
super fucked-up,
you just become, sort of,

1933
01:23:48.428 --> 01:23:50.264
enlightened and...

1934
01:23:50.297 --> 01:23:53.200
We all micro-dosed on mushrooms?

1935
01:23:53.233 --> 01:23:55.302
- Yes.
- When?

1936
01:23:55.335 --> 01:23:59.707
Um... since
dinner on Friday.

1937
01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:02.677
So, all weekend?

1938
01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:06.748
Well, I don't...
no, not, like, all weekend.

1939
01:24:06.781 --> 01:24:08.816
- Friday?
- It was...

1940
01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:10.518
in the mung bean bowls
on Friday,

1941
01:24:10.552 --> 01:24:12.386
and then the...

1942
01:24:12.419 --> 01:24:15.322
the bloody Marys and the BBQ.

1943
01:24:15.355 --> 01:24:17.291
- And today?
- And just now

1944
01:24:17.324 --> 01:24:19.192
- at the cacao.
- So all weekend.

1945
01:24:21.428 --> 01:24:23.531
Lindz...

1946
01:24:23.565 --> 01:24:25.465
How dare you.

1947
01:24:25.499 --> 01:24:27.669
How dare you incept

1948
01:24:27.702 --> 01:24:29.871
my mind with your time?

1949
01:24:29.904 --> 01:24:32.406
What is...
time is crazy.

1950
01:24:32.439 --> 01:24:34.141
Oh, my God.

1951
01:24:34.174 --> 01:24:36.176
Sorry I didn't even realize that

1952
01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:38.312
we were at the end
of the weekend.

1953
01:24:38.345 --> 01:24:40.548
- We're on drugs?
- Oh, I feel bad.

1954
01:24:40.582 --> 01:24:43.183
Yes.

1955
01:24:43.216 --> 01:24:45.385
- We are.
- Oh, my God, no.

1956
01:24:45.419 --> 01:24:46.854
I'm having a bad moment.

1957
01:24:46.888 --> 01:24:48.623
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no.

1958
01:24:48.656 --> 01:24:51.124
Let's "sprin"...
Spin this straw into gold.

1959
01:24:51.158 --> 01:24:53.493
No, Jack said
we couldn't do drugs.

1960
01:24:53.528 --> 01:24:56.229
Jack said we couldn't do...
Jack can't do drugs.

1961
01:24:56.263 --> 01:24:58.131
He actually can do them
pretty well.

1962
01:24:58.165 --> 01:25:00.400
No, no, like,
he can't do them, like,

1963
01:25:00.434 --> 01:25:02.369
he gets drug tested.

1964
01:25:03.738 --> 01:25:06.306
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1965
01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.643
What a twist.

1966
01:25:08.676 --> 01:25:10.444
No, no... don't worry about it,

1967
01:25:10.477 --> 01:25:12.880
Gigi has a guy that's...
It'll all get sorted out.

1968
01:25:12.914 --> 01:25:14.816
- We'll take care of it.
- Oh, my God, no,

1969
01:25:14.849 --> 01:25:17.250
but he has a guy,
he has a... he has a guy,

1970
01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:19.286
his name is Doug,
and it's his officer.

1971
01:25:19.319 --> 01:25:22.155
It's his... It's his...
"he's in trouble" person.

1972
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:23.591
He has to make sure
he's not in trouble.

1973
01:25:23.625 --> 01:25:25.492
He...

1974
01:25:25.526 --> 01:25:28.295
Doug is so irrelevant
in this story.

1975
01:25:28.328 --> 01:25:30.665
I can't even...
I can't even tell you

1976
01:25:30.698 --> 01:25:32.934
how much you don't have
to worry about Doug.

1977
01:25:32.967 --> 01:25:35.202
I don't understand,
and the bad feeling is

1978
01:25:35.235 --> 01:25:37.170
- not going away.
- No-no-no-no-no.

1979
01:25:37.204 --> 01:25:40.240
We're above that... in fact,
we were doing ayahuasca

1980
01:25:40.273 --> 01:25:42.342
with Elon and Grimes

1981
01:25:42.376 --> 01:25:44.177
right before they had the baby,

1982
01:25:44.211 --> 01:25:46.948
- A-Ash-12-17-50,000...
- I think...

1983
01:25:46.981 --> 01:25:48.816
I think I... I need to go.

1984
01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:50.384
- Jackie.
- Oh, my God.

1985
01:25:50.417 --> 01:25:51.753
- Hi.
- Hi.

1986
01:25:51.786 --> 01:25:53.420
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah,

1987
01:25:53.453 --> 01:25:55.288
Doug, yeah, this is not a thing.

1988
01:26:28.422 --> 01:26:29.824
Are you feeling okay?

1989
01:26:32.026 --> 01:26:34.962
Yeah, no, I just... I'm...

1990
01:26:34.996 --> 01:26:36.463
I'm, like, dehydrated

1991
01:26:36.496 --> 01:26:38.231
or... something.

1992
01:26:38.265 --> 01:26:40.935
Honestly, I've felt off,
like, all day.

1993
01:26:40.968 --> 01:26:42.837
It's been...

1994
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:44.605
yeah, it's been
an emotional day.

1995
01:26:46.273 --> 01:26:49.811
That's... That's
an understatement, yeah.

1996
01:26:49.844 --> 01:26:52.479
- Um... I...
- So...

1997
01:26:55.049 --> 01:26:57.284
- No, did you...
- No, what were you gonna say?

1998
01:26:57.317 --> 01:26:58.853
- You wanna?
- No, what were you gonna say?

1999
01:26:58.886 --> 01:27:00.420
- You sure?
- Yeah, no, go.

2000
01:27:02.322 --> 01:27:04.458
Yeah, okay,
I was... you know,

2001
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:05.893
I was hanging out
with Matt by the pool,

2002
01:27:05.927 --> 01:27:07.695
and we were... we were talking.

2003
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:09.664
Oh, my gosh, were you guys
talking about work?

2004
01:27:09.697 --> 01:27:12.332
In a very... yeah, like,
in a roundabout way.

2005
01:27:12.365 --> 01:27:14.969
Jack!
That's incredible.

2006
01:27:15.002 --> 01:27:17.939
You working with Matt,
and me working with Cat.

2007
01:27:17.972 --> 01:27:21.308
This is...
This is really exciting.

2008
01:27:21.341 --> 01:27:22.910
Like, this could
actually happen.

2009
01:27:22.944 --> 01:27:25.513
This... This could be our life.

2010
01:27:27.414 --> 01:27:29.249
Right?

2011
01:27:32.086 --> 01:27:34.689
Look, this...
This isn't real, though.

2012
01:27:34.722 --> 01:27:37.692
Okay, Jack,
this is the thing, though.

2013
01:27:37.725 --> 01:27:40.695
This is the thing that you do
when you are not accepting

2014
01:27:40.728 --> 01:27:42.563
an invitation to upgrade

2015
01:27:42.597 --> 01:27:44.464
because you're scared
to take a leap.

2016
01:27:44.498 --> 01:27:46.433
I don't know what you're
talking about right now.

2017
01:27:46.466 --> 01:27:49.436
I just...
wanna do it

2018
01:27:49.469 --> 01:27:51.506
my way, for once.

2019
01:27:51.539 --> 01:27:53.440
Um, taking money from a stranger

2020
01:27:53.473 --> 01:27:54.842
isn't doing it your way.

2021
01:27:54.876 --> 01:27:56.811
She's not a stranger.

2022
01:27:56.844 --> 01:28:00.380
I'm kind of offended that
you think it's taking money.

2023
01:28:00.413 --> 01:28:02.382
She's investing in me.

2024
01:28:02.415 --> 01:28:04.484
She believes in me.

2025
01:28:04.519 --> 01:28:07.789
Could you try maybe
taking a note from Cat?

2026
01:28:07.822 --> 01:28:09.824
Maybe a, "Hey, Lindsay,
you're really talented.

2027
01:28:09.857 --> 01:28:11.626
"Hey, I would love
to support you.

2028
01:28:11.659 --> 01:28:13.094
"Hey, I think you're worth it.

2029
01:28:13.127 --> 01:28:15.295
Hey, this could be
really good for us."

2030
01:28:18.666 --> 01:28:21.836
No, okay. Okay.

2031
01:28:21.869 --> 01:28:23.504
- Lindsay?
- No, it's fine.

2032
01:28:23.538 --> 01:28:26.073
Lindsay? Lindsay?

2033
01:28:26.107 --> 01:28:28.676
I love you.
We don't know them.

2034
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:30.545
And you don't know
how to run a business,

2035
01:28:30.578 --> 01:28:32.445
so getting into business
with these people,

2036
01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.048
it's like...
That's a terrible idea.

2037
01:28:34.081 --> 01:28:35.917
You are not...

2038
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:38.519
physically, mentally,

2039
01:28:38.553 --> 01:28:40.755
and emotionally capable
of running a business.

2040
01:28:40.788 --> 01:28:43.057
I'm not either, so, like,
taking money from someone...

2041
01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:44.625
Hey, Jack?

2042
01:28:46.426 --> 01:28:47.962
Please stop.

2043
01:28:55.703 --> 01:28:57.004
Dinner's almost ready.

2044
01:28:57.038 --> 01:28:59.372
- Great, thank you.
- Great.

2045
01:28:59.406 --> 01:29:02.043
You guys doing good?
You look great.

2046
01:29:02.076 --> 01:29:03.945
- Thanks, see you at dinner.
- Okay.

2047
01:29:03.978 --> 01:29:05.445
Okay, I wasn't listening.

2048
01:29:05.478 --> 01:29:07.548
No, but the really

2049
01:29:07.582 --> 01:29:08.950
fucked-up thing is,
do you know how much

2050
01:29:08.983 --> 01:29:10.685
I paid Dan this year?

2051
01:29:10.718 --> 01:29:13.521
Like, $250,000.

2052
01:29:13.554 --> 01:29:15.523
And that's on top of his salary.

2053
01:29:15.556 --> 01:29:17.625
That's not the salary.

2054
01:29:17.658 --> 01:29:20.728
Milton's asked that
we all meet down at the barn

2055
01:29:20.761 --> 01:29:22.697
for the weekend finale.

2056
01:29:22.730 --> 01:29:25.800
But, hey... hey, hey!

2057
01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:29.637
But first I just want
to quickly express again

2058
01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:33.708
my deep and sincere appreciation

2059
01:29:33.741 --> 01:29:36.677
to each and every one of you

2060
01:29:36.711 --> 01:29:38.713
for opening yourselves up to...

2061
01:29:38.746 --> 01:29:40.480
- Blah-blah-blah-blah...
- ...to each other.

2062
01:29:40.514 --> 01:29:43.050
- Let's get weird!
- Let's get it!

2063
01:29:43.084 --> 01:29:44.685
Fuck it,
let's get weird, Carrie.

2064
01:29:44.719 --> 01:29:45.987
Let's fucking get weird.

2065
01:30:04.572 --> 01:30:07.008
Everybody put
your fucking headphones on!

2066
01:30:28.029 --> 01:30:29.797
Why do you look so bored?

2067
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:31.498
Ugh, I'm not bored, I'm just...

2068
01:30:31.532 --> 01:30:32.967
Drink.

2069
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.235
I can't drink champagne
right now.

2070
01:30:34.268 --> 01:30:35.970
Just have a glass of champagne.

2071
01:30:36.003 --> 01:30:37.738
I don't wanna
drink champagne right now.

2072
01:30:37.772 --> 01:30:39.573
Please, just one,
it'll be the best night ever.

2073
01:30:39.607 --> 01:30:41.742
I'm sorry, I just...
I'm so mad at Jack right now.

2074
01:30:41.776 --> 01:30:43.177
If you don't have
one glass of champagne,

2075
01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:46.147
I will literally kill myself.

2076
01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:48.149
I swear to God, I will jump
right out of that window

2077
01:30:48.182 --> 01:30:50.818
like the Kool-Aid Man.

2078
01:30:50.851 --> 01:30:53.654
I will eat an entire box
of Tide Pods.

2079
01:30:53.688 --> 01:30:55.923
I will drink
an entire bottle of bleach.

2080
01:30:55.957 --> 01:30:57.725
Daniel, hit me with the bleach!

2081
01:30:57.758 --> 01:30:59.560
It's happening.

2082
01:30:59.593 --> 01:31:01.929
I will drink a sip.

2083
01:31:01.963 --> 01:31:03.731
Good girl.

2084
01:31:07.702 --> 01:31:09.570
That a baby!

2085
01:31:09.603 --> 01:31:12.039
Let's show these fuckers
how to dance!

2086
01:32:01.722 --> 01:32:03.758
- Hi.
- Hey.

2087
01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:05.960
- Could I get a water?
- Yeah!

2088
01:32:05.993 --> 01:32:07.661
Take those headphones off.

2089
01:32:07.695 --> 01:32:09.797
Oh...

2090
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:11.899
- Can I get a water?
- Yeah.

2091
01:32:11.932 --> 01:32:14.068
- There you go.
- Wow, you are flying.

2092
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:17.838
Mmm.

2093
01:32:20.908 --> 01:32:22.943
You guys are
really feeling it already.

2094
01:32:24.178 --> 01:32:26.080
- Yeah.
- They wanted us to break

2095
01:32:26.113 --> 01:32:27.815
the pills in half,
but they were just...

2096
01:32:27.848 --> 01:32:29.784
too hard, so we just
plopped them right in.

2097
01:32:29.817 --> 01:32:32.653
What?

2098
01:32:32.686 --> 01:32:34.055
- The pills.
- In the champagne.

2099
01:32:34.088 --> 01:32:35.689
Yeah, double-stack Cadillacs.

2100
01:32:35.723 --> 01:32:38.025
Waah!

2101
01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:42.596
- Oh, shit.
- Uh-oh.

2102
01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:43.898
Okay.

2103
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:45.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

2104
01:32:47.101 --> 01:32:50.337
Hi, hi...

2105
01:32:50.371 --> 01:32:53.641
...that is wild.

2106
01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:55.209
Uh-huh.
Hey, can I talk...

2107
01:32:55.242 --> 01:32:56.677
Can I talk to you for a second?

2108
01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:59.080
Yeah, let's...
let's connect.

2109
01:32:59.113 --> 01:33:01.615
- Okay.
- You are so soft.

2110
01:33:01.649 --> 01:33:02.917
- Oh, thank you.
- Your skin is so soft.

2111
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:04.685
We don't touch enough.

2112
01:33:04.718 --> 01:33:06.287
- I know.
- We used to touch more.

2113
01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.988
- I love you too.
- I love you so much.

2114
01:33:08.022 --> 01:33:09.256
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

2115
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:10.324
- I feel amazing...
- Hey, Jack?

2116
01:33:10.357 --> 01:33:11.892
...Right now, yes, Lindsay.

2117
01:33:11.926 --> 01:33:13.127
- I know.
- I feel amazing, I love...

2118
01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.829
- Listen to me.
- Yeah.

2119
01:33:14.862 --> 01:33:16.130
That's because we're on molly.

2120
01:33:16.163 --> 01:33:17.832
What?

2121
01:33:17.865 --> 01:33:19.633
It was in the champagne.

2122
01:33:19.667 --> 01:33:21.702
We were also
on mushrooms all day.

2123
01:33:21.735 --> 01:33:23.938
- What?!
- Yeah, it was in the cacao.

2124
01:33:23.971 --> 01:33:25.706
- The chocolate?
- Uh-huh.

2125
01:33:25.739 --> 01:33:27.875
And a couple of other things.

2126
01:33:29.410 --> 01:33:31.846
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Just breathe.

2127
01:33:31.879 --> 01:33:33.747
- I can't do drugs.
- No, I think it's a little

2128
01:33:33.781 --> 01:33:35.649
too late, though.

2129
01:33:35.683 --> 01:33:37.051
All of these people drugged us?

2130
01:33:37.084 --> 01:33:39.286
Fuck them!
Fuck them so fucking hard!

2131
01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.188
- Fuck you!
- Jack!

2132
01:33:41.222 --> 01:33:43.124
I need you to calm down, okay?

2133
01:33:43.157 --> 01:33:44.692
- You need to breathe.
- Okay.

2134
01:33:44.725 --> 01:33:46.293
I see the dragon coming.

2135
01:33:46.327 --> 01:33:47.995
And I want you to stay with me,

2136
01:33:48.028 --> 01:33:49.430
and I want you to look
in me, in my eyes.

2137
01:33:49.463 --> 01:33:52.166
Okay? I told her
that you can't do drugs.

2138
01:33:52.199 --> 01:33:53.868
- I can't do drugs.
- And it's okay

2139
01:33:53.901 --> 01:33:55.369
- because Cat has a guy.
- Cat has a guy,

2140
01:33:55.402 --> 01:33:57.104
- Yeah.
- Well, I mean,

2141
01:33:57.138 --> 01:33:58.806
it's not Cat's guy,
it's... Gigi has a guy.

2142
01:33:58.839 --> 01:34:00.241
And there's
something about Elon.

2143
01:34:00.274 --> 01:34:01.942
- Elon?
- Yeah.

2144
01:34:01.976 --> 01:34:03.344
It's okay because
she has a podcast...

2145
01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:05.079
A... what the fuck are
you talking about

2146
01:34:05.112 --> 01:34:06.947
- right now?
- No, listen to me, I'm just...

2147
01:34:06.981 --> 01:34:08.749
These people do this,
it's like, it happens

2148
01:34:08.782 --> 01:34:10.351
in little doses, and listen,

2149
01:34:10.384 --> 01:34:12.987
I just need everything
to be cool because...

2150
01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.422
Well, I can't be cool
right now, Lindsey,

2151
01:34:15.456 --> 01:34:17.224
I'm on drugs,
I can't be cool right now!

2152
01:34:17.258 --> 01:34:18.959
Okay, please...
Please stop yelling.

2153
01:34:18.993 --> 01:34:21.162
- You're making a scene.
- I'm sorry that

2154
01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:23.030
I'm making a scene in front
of these fucking people

2155
01:34:23.063 --> 01:34:24.798
who are trying
to ruin our lives.

2156
01:34:24.832 --> 01:34:26.167
- Oh, my God.
- These fucking people

2157
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.701
you've known
for ten fucking days!

2158
01:34:27.735 --> 01:34:29.370
These people?
These people? Jack,

2159
01:34:29.403 --> 01:34:31.305
Jesus Christ, are you even
listening to yourself?

2160
01:34:31.338 --> 01:34:33.407
You just keep
repeating yourself,

2161
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.709
over and over and over again!

2162
01:34:35.743 --> 01:34:37.978
You keep saying
the same stupid shit,

2163
01:34:38.012 --> 01:34:40.915
and you keep wearing
the same stupid shit,

2164
01:34:40.948 --> 01:34:42.383
and you keep watching the same

2165
01:34:42.416 --> 01:34:44.051
stupid shit,
and you keep being this...

2166
01:34:44.084 --> 01:34:46.187
shitty version of yourself,

2167
01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.788
and I keep waiting
for you to change,

2168
01:34:47.821 --> 01:34:49.190
and you're not changing,
and I just...

2169
01:34:49.223 --> 01:34:50.925
I understand that you fell down,

2170
01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:52.426
and I just need you... I need you

2171
01:34:52.459 --> 01:34:53.928
to get back up, okay?

2172
01:34:53.961 --> 01:34:55.196
And I know that you blame me.

2173
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:56.830
- I don't blame you...
- You do.

2174
01:34:56.864 --> 01:34:57.731
- I don't blame you.
- Listen to me.

2175
01:34:57.765 --> 01:34:59.233
I understand

2176
01:34:59.266 --> 01:35:01.168
that you're angry,
but I need you

2177
01:35:01.202 --> 01:35:03.003
to get back up.

2178
01:35:03.037 --> 01:35:04.872
Because this person
believes in me.

2179
01:35:04.905 --> 01:35:06.907
- Cat believes in you?
- Yes.

2180
01:35:06.941 --> 01:35:08.242
I don't believe in you
but Cat believes in you?

2181
01:35:08.275 --> 01:35:10.377
We're here because
your friend Cat

2182
01:35:10.411 --> 01:35:12.213
- believes in you? Yeah?
- Yes, Jack!

2183
01:35:12.246 --> 01:35:13.881
She is my friend.
Why else would we be here?

2184
01:35:13.914 --> 01:35:17.084
Because they're
fucking rich, Lindsay.

2185
01:35:17.117 --> 01:35:19.253
That's it.
They beckoned.

2186
01:35:19.286 --> 01:35:22.056
We fucking came, okay?
And your friend Cat?

2187
01:35:22.089 --> 01:35:24.191
You just wanna be her.

2188
01:35:24.225 --> 01:35:26.360
She fucking sucks.

2189
01:35:26.393 --> 01:35:28.162
She's mean,
and she's manipulative,

2190
01:35:28.195 --> 01:35:30.231
and she's a fucking bully,
and these people...

2191
01:35:30.264 --> 01:35:32.099
They're not your friends.

2192
01:35:32.132 --> 01:35:33.867
All right?
We are entertainment to them.

2193
01:35:33.901 --> 01:35:35.469
They think the way
we live our life is funny.

2194
01:35:35.503 --> 01:35:37.771
They think the way I dress
is fucking funny.

2195
01:35:37.805 --> 01:35:40.841
Okay? I understand
that I am not

2196
01:35:40.874 --> 01:35:42.276
giving you
what you want in life,

2197
01:35:42.309 --> 01:35:45.112
and I'm sorry, but, like,

2198
01:35:45.145 --> 01:35:47.515
this isn't us.

2199
01:35:47.549 --> 01:35:50.184
We are not gonna have
this life ever.

2200
01:35:53.921 --> 01:35:55.990
Well, then maybe
I don't want our life anymore.

2201
01:35:58.192 --> 01:36:01.295
No, no, no.
What does that mean?

2202
01:36:02.997 --> 01:36:04.498
I don't know.

2203
01:36:06.367 --> 01:36:08.235
No, I love you.
These people don't love you.

2204
01:36:08.269 --> 01:36:09.537
I love you.
I love you.

2205
01:36:09.571 --> 01:36:11.205
- Jack.
- I love you.

2206
01:36:11.238 --> 01:36:13.575
- Look at me, I love you.
- I hear you.

2207
01:36:13.608 --> 01:36:17.211
But you were just yelling at me.

2208
01:36:17.244 --> 01:36:19.880
And I'm going outside.

2209
01:36:19.913 --> 01:36:22.082
Lindsay.

2210
01:36:22.116 --> 01:36:24.218
Savage, bro.

2211
01:36:24.251 --> 01:36:26.554
Fuck you, Kerry.

2212
01:36:26.588 --> 01:36:29.189
That's fair.

2213
01:36:36.196 --> 01:36:38.465
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

2214
01:36:38.499 --> 01:36:40.502
I am so sorry.
I am so embarrassed.

2215
01:36:40.535 --> 01:36:42.202
I am mortified, Jack just...

2216
01:36:42.236 --> 01:36:44.104
- Oh, Lindz, Lindsay...
- I can't believe

2217
01:36:44.138 --> 01:36:46.473
- he said those things.
- I... honestly, I loved it.

2218
01:36:46.508 --> 01:36:48.475
I loved it.

2219
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:50.844
- What?
- Nobody ever has

2220
01:36:50.878 --> 01:36:53.314
the balls to talk to me
like that.

2221
01:36:53.347 --> 01:36:56.216
Like, we pay them too much.

2222
01:36:58.452 --> 01:37:01.121
Even Matt is terrified of me,

2223
01:37:01.155 --> 01:37:04.458
which I love.

2224
01:37:04.491 --> 01:37:06.561
But it also makes me sad.

2225
01:37:09.263 --> 01:37:12.032
But, like, I'm not
the only one who's sad

2226
01:37:12.066 --> 01:37:13.501
and fucked up, you know?

2227
01:37:13.535 --> 01:37:16.504
Like, I... yeah,
I'm an alcoholic.

2228
01:37:16.538 --> 01:37:18.906
My husband's a workaholic.

2229
01:37:18.939 --> 01:37:20.441
Your husband is insecure.

2230
01:37:20.474 --> 01:37:22.910
You lack purpose.

2231
01:37:24.078 --> 01:37:26.046
But so do I, that's...

2232
01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.248
that's why I'm an alcoholic.

2233
01:37:28.282 --> 01:37:30.117
It gives me something to do.

2234
01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:33.220
- No.
- We're like a clown car

2235
01:37:33.253 --> 01:37:36.090
on the way
to a Chris Gaines concert.

2236
01:37:36.123 --> 01:37:37.559
- No.
- Look at us.

2237
01:37:37.592 --> 01:37:39.960
No... no!

2238
01:37:39.993 --> 01:37:41.362
It's like, God, I just...

2239
01:37:41.395 --> 01:37:43.030
I just wanted not to be us for,

2240
01:37:43.063 --> 01:37:44.932
like, a minute.

2241
01:37:44.965 --> 01:37:48.135
- Do you know what I mean?
- How'd that go?

2242
01:37:48.168 --> 01:37:50.070
My husband's

2243
01:37:50.104 --> 01:37:52.406
rolling his face off,
and he just screamed at me.

2244
01:37:52.439 --> 01:37:55.909
I saw that.
I loved that.

2245
01:37:55.943 --> 01:37:57.579
For me... not...
I didn't love that for you.

2246
01:37:57.612 --> 01:37:59.913
That must have been
really embarrassing.

2247
01:37:59.947 --> 01:38:01.482
- Yeah.
- Gosh.

2248
01:38:01.516 --> 01:38:03.618
It was.

2249
01:38:04.952 --> 01:38:06.654
I'm...

2250
01:38:06.688 --> 01:38:08.956
I'm trying to work
on my empathy.

2251
01:38:08.989 --> 01:38:11.125
Did I pass the test?

2252
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.596
Hey, sorry that you thought that

2253
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:16.698
I had an answer or something...

2254
01:38:16.731 --> 01:38:20.134
Somehow the missing piece
in your heart.

2255
01:38:20.167 --> 01:38:22.369
Most of me is missing,
to be honest.

2256
01:38:22.403 --> 01:38:24.506
It doesn't make any sense

2257
01:38:24.539 --> 01:38:27.374
'cause I have everything
that I ever wanted,

2258
01:38:27.408 --> 01:38:30.377
and I'm... not happy.

2259
01:38:30.411 --> 01:38:32.479
I have a hot husband,

2260
01:38:32.514 --> 01:38:35.249
and I have
two beautiful children,

2261
01:38:35.282 --> 01:38:37.484
and I have...

2262
01:38:37.519 --> 01:38:40.454
12 properties.

2263
01:38:40.487 --> 01:38:44.158
Money doesn't fix
your problems, babe.

2264
01:38:44.191 --> 01:38:46.528
It just makes them prettier.

2265
01:38:48.996 --> 01:38:51.031
Oh! Okay.

2266
01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.569
Should I write a book?

2267
01:38:54.602 --> 01:38:56.671
Should I be a poet?

2268
01:38:56.704 --> 01:38:59.973
Should we smash
John Mayer's guitar, um...

2269
01:39:00.007 --> 01:39:01.275
- That's John Mayer's guitar?
- Yes!

2270
01:39:01.308 --> 01:39:03.143
It's John Mayer's guitar.

2271
01:39:03.177 --> 01:39:06.380
He left it here,
and he clearly didn't want it.

2272
01:39:06.413 --> 01:39:08.182
Oh, my God!

2273
01:39:09.416 --> 01:39:12.687
Stop! Stop!

2274
01:39:14.455 --> 01:39:16.423
Whoo!

2275
01:39:18.793 --> 01:39:20.762
What the fuck are you doing?

2276
01:39:20.795 --> 01:39:23.230
Um, living?

2277
01:39:23.263 --> 01:39:25.365
Let me live, okay?

2278
01:39:27.635 --> 01:39:29.236
Should I call Milton

2279
01:39:29.269 --> 01:39:31.038
and have him bring us
some snacks?

2280
01:39:31.071 --> 01:39:33.040
We're having fun.

2281
01:39:33.073 --> 01:39:35.175
Milton!

2282
01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:36.678
I'm going to bed.

2283
01:39:36.711 --> 01:39:38.145
Bye.

2284
01:39:39.346 --> 01:39:41.749
Milton!

2285
01:41:06.901 --> 01:41:08.803
I'm sorry.

2286
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:12.139
I'm really...
I'm just really sorry.

2287
01:41:12.172 --> 01:41:14.141
Jack, stop.

2288
01:41:22.917 --> 01:41:24.652
I'm really...

2289
01:41:26.754 --> 01:41:29.423
unhappy.

2290
01:41:29.456 --> 01:41:31.626
I know, and I'm really...

2291
01:41:31.659 --> 01:41:34.161
I'm really sorry, and I...

2292
01:41:35.730 --> 01:41:37.765
It's not your fault.

2293
01:41:43.303 --> 01:41:45.573
It's nobody's fault.

2294
01:42:05.325 --> 01:42:08.428
I'm really fucking intimidated
by these people.

2295
01:42:10.665 --> 01:42:12.867
I don't want to be these people.

2296
01:42:15.937 --> 01:42:17.805
I love you.

2297
01:42:17.839 --> 01:42:20.407
I'm sorry.

2298
01:42:27.715 --> 01:42:29.684
Please forgive me.

2299
01:42:32.219 --> 01:42:33.688
You're such a fucking dick.

2300
01:42:35.556 --> 01:42:38.860
Take a sip of the cacao.

2301
01:42:38.893 --> 01:42:40.862
Daniel!

2302
01:42:40.895 --> 01:42:43.463
My God, can we please get
the fuck out of here?

2303
01:42:43.497 --> 01:42:45.232
- Yes, yes,
- Okay.

2304
01:42:45.265 --> 01:42:46.501
Get your shit, go!

2305
01:43:10.725 --> 01:43:12.694
There's still no service.

2306
01:43:20.001 --> 01:43:21.969
We'll figure it out.

2307
01:43:31.713 --> 01:43:33.548
We'll figure it out.

2308
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:04.846
You know what?
I'm gonna throw in

2309
01:44:04.879 --> 01:44:06.446
an extra case for you guys.

2310
01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.315
- Hey.
- Thank you.

2311
01:44:08.348 --> 01:44:09.917
Yeah, just because
I feel like we're connecting

2312
01:44:09.951 --> 01:44:11.586
on a wine level.

2313
01:44:11.619 --> 01:44:12.920
You know, 'cause I see people's

2314
01:44:12.954 --> 01:44:14.889
- wine spirits.
- Which one am I?

2315
01:44:14.922 --> 01:44:16.691
Oh...

2316
01:44:21.829 --> 01:44:24.364
The joy. The joy,
it kind of says to me,

2317
01:44:24.397 --> 01:44:26.033
just, like, viognier.

2318
01:44:26.067 --> 01:44:27.702
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, Kerry's

2319
01:44:27.735 --> 01:44:29.604
- kind of effervescent.
- Thank you.

2320
01:44:29.637 --> 01:44:31.506
Effervescent's kind of
a strong word for viognier.

2321
01:44:31.539 --> 01:44:33.007
You know, okay?

2322
01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.441
But that's... that's just really

2323
01:44:34.474 --> 01:44:35.710
between us wine people.
