2
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:39.750
A long time ago, it is said,
a monster came here.

3
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.291
A white tail.

4
00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:28.458
Sarii.

5
00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.625
Go around.

6
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.166
I remember when
Father told me I was ready for kühtaamia.

7
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.750
My big hunt.

8
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.750
You were little.
So, Mother took you to gather medicine.

9
00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:14.083
But Father and I,
we went up into the hills.

10
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.375
The rain was bad. Everything was wet.

11
00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.000
We crawled through the mud
and my bowstring…

12
00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.416
-…got ruined and--

13
00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:28.708
-You were sleeping.

14
00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:31.750
I was waiting for it to circle back.

15
00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:34.333
Now you're gonna have to
cross the river to get it.

16
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.250
Whoa.

17
00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.041
Don't get your bowstring wet.

18
00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:40.958
Taabe,

19
00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:43.500
this morning in the sky,

20
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.833
I saw a sign. The thunderbird.

21
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.000
I've been practicing.

22
00:06:50.083 --> 00:06:52.833
It's time. I'm ready for my kühtaamia.

23
00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:54.916
You really think you're ready?

24
00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.791
You wanna hunt something
that's hunting you?

25
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.166
Search.

26
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.000
-Trained him well.
-It's easy. He's smart.

27
00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:08.291
Not every smart creature is easy to train.

28
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.458
-Is that for War Chief's bad knee?
-Mmm.

29
00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:17.375
He's getting worse.

30
00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.000
You didn't put orange totsiyaa.

31
00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:26.583
Who taught you about orange totsiyaa?

32
00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:28.541
You.

33
00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:30.291
Hmm.

34
00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:42.166
Your father left you that
to cut breadroot with.

35
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:47.000
I almost got a deer with it.

36
00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.708
Yeah. Well, we can't eat "almost."

37
00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:55.083
My girl, you are good
at so many other things.

38
00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:57.250
Why do you want to hunt?

39
00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:00.875
Because you all think that I can't.

40
00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:07.708
Ah!

41
00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:10.416
In this wind, he brings home a red-tail.

42
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:13.833
You should have listened to my story.

43
00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:16.833
Didn't think we had time for a nap.

44
00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:20.041
Crazy.

45
00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:24.041
It's sharp enough.

46
00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.416
Go get us some orange totsiyaa.

47
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.250
Itsee.

48
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.208
-Hina?
-A lion. It took Puhi.

49
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.375
We gotta find him.

50
00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.958
You could get shot sneaking up like that.

51
00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:00.666
-Who's sneaking?

52
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.000
Who invited you?

53
00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:05.458
We won't be gone long enough
to need a cook.

54
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.333
She should stay.

55
00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:10.750
She tracks well.

56
00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:13.583
And if we find Puhi alive,
she knows medicine.

57
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.500
You have to find that cat now.

58
00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:23.250
-I will.
-I know.

59
00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:25.291
'Cause you have to.

60
00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:34.208
Oh, good. The dog found shit.

61
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.458
-We're not looking for wolves.
-It's not wolf.

62
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:39.083
You see that crushed bone?

63
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.291
That's lion scat.

64
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:44.291
And the cat that made it was big.

65
00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.416
He's breathing.

66
00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:20.416
Search.

67
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.041
So much could kill him.

68
00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:10.916
It won't kill him.
Just cool his blood.

69
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:24.375
Anaa. Anaa.

70
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.958
Taabe wants to stay and hunt.

71
00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:31.041
Let's go.

72
00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.333
-I'm coming with you.
-I can handle the lion.

73
00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:34.958
No, it's not just the lion.

74
00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:39.916
Why is Puhi alive? There's something
that scared the cat away from its den.

75
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.583
I've got this.

76
00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:44.291
Stay with Puhi. He needs your help too.

77
00:16:45.583 --> 00:16:49.416
We don't have time to waste talking.
We need to get him home.

78
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.625
Hurry up.

79
00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:15.041
I'm cold.

80
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.708
Don't move.

81
00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:21.166
No.

82
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.416
The cold is good.

83
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.166
The medicine slows his blood.
If he gets warm, he'll bleed out.

84
00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:27.666
Hey.

85
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.041
Do you want him
to be comfortable or alive?

86
00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:31.125
Going.

87
00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:40.500
We don't have time to wait for you.

88
00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:42.958
-Look.
-Could be bear tracks.

89
00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:44.875
Maybe.

90
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:47.291
But that's a big bear.

91
00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:50.291
And why was it on its hind legs?
And what skins a snake like that?

92
00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.958
-We need to keep moving.
-No.

93
00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:53.458
I have to warn my brother.

94
00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:56.375
Paaka, go with her.

95
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.291
Naru, we don't need the torches.
They'll scare the cat.

96
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:05.958
We're in its hunting grounds.

97
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:07.583
Why'd you come back?

98
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.791
I found tracks, and they were huge.

99
00:20:10.875 --> 00:20:13.208
I'm not frightened by a bear.

100
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:15.125
I don't think it was a bear.

101
00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:18.541
I don't know what it was.
I've never seen anything like it.

102
00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:21.250
It skinned and gutted a snake.

103
00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:24.625
Well, whatever it was,
we're in the cat's den now.

104
00:20:24.708 --> 00:20:26.625
We have to deal with it first.

105
00:20:26.708 --> 00:20:27.833
Come on.

106
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.750
The lion won't think
that we're hunting it here.

107
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.000
It'll think it's hunting us.

108
00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:46.375
We get some bait,
then climb up and wait for it.

109
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:52.208
A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts.
We could be here all night.

110
00:20:52.291 --> 00:20:55.416
We could stalk the forest all night
and not find anything too.

111
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.375
If you're too afraid to hunt,
go back to camp where you belong.

112
00:20:58.458 --> 00:20:59.750
We'll try it Naru's way.

113
00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:03.708
We'll bait it,
then I'll lead the cat to you.

114
00:21:05.083 --> 00:21:06.125
Wait.

115
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.250
It's time, Naru.

116
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.625
Your kühtaamia.

117
00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:18.541
When the lion comes, you tell that thing,

118
00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:21.166
"This is as far as you go.

119
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.500
No more. This is it."

120
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:11.708
It won't matter how sharp it is
if you're too afraid to use it.

121
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.291
You think you're ready?

122
00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:20.666
You've never faced a lion.

123
00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:25.666
Its mouth full of teeth like arrows,

124
00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:31.333
ready to tear your flesh
and crush your bones.

125
00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:40.458
When your brother comes back,
he and I will find the lion

126
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:42.791
-and kill it.

127
00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:57.666
Your brother carried you home.

128
00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:02.791
Wha-- What about the lion?

129
00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.041
-Taabe went after it.
-Okay.

130
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:06.375
I have to find him.

131
00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:08.833
No, you need to rest.

132
00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:11.333
Here.

133
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:13.666
Drink this tea.

134
00:24:14.791 --> 00:24:15.916
Here.

135
00:24:25.583 --> 00:24:29.708
Puhi survived
because of your medicine.

136
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.500
There's something else out there.
Taabe needs my help.

137
00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:42.791
If your brother needed you,
he wouldn't have brought you back here.

138
00:24:46.208 --> 00:24:50.791
You think the reason for kühtaamia
is to prove you can hunt,

139
00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:53.791
but there's only one reason.

140
00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:57.333
To survive.

141
00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:03.750
Taabe kima! Taabe kima!

142
00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:03.041
-Naru.
-War Chief.

143
00:27:03.125 --> 00:27:04.291
Naru.

144
00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:05.583
Where are you going?

145
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.750
-We did it.

146
00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:09.916
No.

147
00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:12.041
We didn't do it.

148
00:27:13.416 --> 00:27:16.208
What do you think left those tracks
and skinned that snake?

149
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.458
And before I fell,

150
00:27:17.541 --> 00:27:19.333
-I saw lightning in the trees.
-Naru.

151
00:27:19.416 --> 00:27:22.291
-There's something else out there.
-And if there is, I'll get it.

152
00:27:22.375 --> 00:27:23.583
We need to go back out.

153
00:27:23.666 --> 00:27:26.208
-Far, beyond the ridgeline.
-No.

154
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:29.125
-Okay. Well, I'll hunt alone if I have to.
-You can't.

155
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.416
-Do I need your permission, War Chief?
-It's not about permission.

156
00:27:35.541 --> 00:27:37.500
You can't.

157
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:40.791
I had to carry you back.

158
00:27:45.708 --> 00:27:46.916
I can hunt.

159
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:48.583
You're right.

160
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:51.208
We didn't do it.

161
00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:54.166
I did.

162
00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:59.750
You tried it. You just…

163
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:02.916
You couldn't bring it home.

164
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:20.166
If they don't see,

165
00:29:21.583 --> 00:29:22.625
then show them.

166
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.958
Come.

167
00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:17.166
Next time, you're cooking.

168
00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:33.375
Come.

169
00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:37.250
Come with me.

170
00:34:39.916 --> 00:34:42.250
We have to go find
whatever left those tracks.

171
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.625
-Now.

172
00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:41.791
Buffalo spirit, fly well.

173
00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:45.916
Thanks creator, for your life.

174
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:56.291
Sarii?

175
00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:24.541
There you are.

176
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:21.500
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

177
00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:23.416
Your brother sent us to bring you home.

178
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.500
Where is he?

179
00:46:24.583 --> 00:46:26.750
Searching for you
on the other side of the pass.

180
00:46:28.791 --> 00:46:30.000
Where are you going?

181
00:46:32.958 --> 00:46:34.916
-I saw it.
-Saw what?

182
00:46:35.416 --> 00:46:36.875
I saw what left those tracks.

183
00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:38.291
-The bear?
-There was a bear,

184
00:46:38.375 --> 00:46:40.458
but there was something else,
and it was huge.

185
00:46:40.541 --> 00:46:43.250
I couldn't see it until it was
covered in blood, but it looked like--

186
00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:47.166
-like a mupitsI.

187
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.416
You saw a monster from a children's story?

188
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.416
It fought and killed a bear
with its hands, easily.

189
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.333
How come it didn't kill you?

190
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:58.958
Stop!

191
00:46:59.708 --> 00:47:00.708
You're going home.

192
00:47:01.791 --> 00:47:02.958
-Enough!

193
00:47:30.125 --> 00:47:31.666
That's bad.

194
00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:43.375
You wanna leave? Then leave.

195
00:47:50.125 --> 00:47:51.333
We're going home.

196
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.416
There's something out there.

197
00:48:05.375 --> 00:48:06.375
Quit it!

198
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.208
Just sit.

199
00:48:13.208 --> 00:48:14.708
You need a leash for your weapon?

200
00:48:21.166 --> 00:48:24.166
Get some water.
We'll rest a minute. Stay together.

201
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.875
-What about Taabe?
-He'll meet us back at camp.

202
00:48:30.166 --> 00:48:31.750
I said stay together.

203
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.916
I gotta go take a squat.
You want me to do it here?

204
00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:39.833
Water.

205
00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:35.708
You should see your face.

206
00:49:36.291 --> 00:49:39.125
What do you think
drove the possums our way?

207
00:50:25.833 --> 00:50:27.416
Hey. Cut me loose.

208
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:29.250
Stay down.

209
00:53:05.333 --> 00:53:07.500
Shh.

210
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.625
-We have him.

211
00:54:10.875 --> 00:54:12.416
No. He has us.

212
00:55:20.625 --> 00:55:23.833
-Look here.

213
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.166
Look.

214
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.500
A woman?

215
00:55:31.583 --> 00:55:33.375
What is she doing here?

216
00:55:34.166 --> 00:55:35.958
I'm going to take her.

217
00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:37.500
She's going to delay us.

218
00:55:37.583 --> 00:55:41.333
No. By the way she was running,
I think she saw something or escaping.

219
00:56:01.166 --> 00:56:03.833
She's your new blonde, right?

220
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:51.625
Get that goddamned dog out of here!

221
00:56:53.583 --> 00:56:55.166
Sarii?

222
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:57.125
I don't have a good feeling about this.

223
00:57:07.583 --> 00:57:09.375
You killed the buffalo.

224
00:57:22.208 --> 00:57:23.458
Ah…

225
00:57:43.833 --> 00:57:47.791
Are you pissed off?
Now, you will pay.

226
00:57:47.875 --> 00:57:49.541
Let's see what she knows.

227
00:57:50.583 --> 00:57:53.041
- Talk to her Raphael.
- What are you doing here, huh?

228
00:57:53.125 --> 00:57:55.666
- It's a trap?
- What is happening?

229
00:58:02.875 --> 00:58:04.541
What did you see?

230
00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:07.875
I speak a lot of languages.

231
00:58:10.041 --> 00:58:12.083
You are Comanche, yes?

232
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:17.125
- I'll kill her.
- Non, non, non, non, non, non, non. You won't.

233
00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:19.125
We can still use her.

234
00:58:19.208 --> 00:58:20.750
Ah.

235
00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:26.958
You should be helping us.

236
00:58:28.333 --> 00:58:30.958
I think this creature is a hunter,

237
00:58:32.625 --> 00:58:34.791
looking for the strongest beast.

238
00:58:36.208 --> 00:58:37.541
What do you know?

239
00:58:40.458 --> 00:58:42.000
It killed your whole party.

240
00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:44.083
She's not trustworthy.

241
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
No.

242
00:58:46.708 --> 00:58:48.500
It didn't kill everyone.

243
00:58:49.708 --> 00:58:52.041
If you were smart, you'd help us.

244
00:58:52.125 --> 00:58:56.458
Take the savage out.
Get him out of the goddamn box!

245
00:58:59.583 --> 00:59:00.583
What?

246
00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:06.208
In one way or another, you'll help us.

247
00:59:07.875 --> 00:59:10.750
-Make him bleed.

248
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:28.500
Are you hurt?

249
00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:32.750
Oh, they tried.

250
00:59:46.833 --> 00:59:49.125
We shouldn't have brought the horses.

251
00:59:50.125 --> 00:59:52.833
Shut them up or the beast won't show.

252
00:59:54.666 --> 00:59:56.750
Son of a bitch.

253
00:59:58.458 --> 01:00:01.875
The thing the white men
are trying to catch…

254
01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:04.208
-…that's what you went out after?

255
01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:06.458
-It's what you were tracking?

256
01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:07.625
Yes.

257
01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:10.916
And that's what you chose for kühtaamia?

258
01:00:16.458 --> 01:00:19.500
Where is the goddamn beast?

259
01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:22.416
-I'm hungry and I need to piss.

260
01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:31.916
-What's happening?

261
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.375
Oh, non, non, non.
What's happening?

262
01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:37.416
- What is happening??
- What is happening? Rambert!

263
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.000
Shoot, Rambert !

264
01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:47.958
Shit.

265
01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:01.208
I need to get me a horse.

266
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:07.583
It's here!

267
01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:13.000
-It's coming.
-It's here!

268
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.750
This is some crazy shit.

269
01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:20.000
Naru.

270
01:01:22.208 --> 01:01:24.041
Can you get your side loose?

271
01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:55.041
Naru.

272
01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:59.166
We're the bait. He's coming for us.

273
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.500
No.

274
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.708
No. It doesn't want bait.
It doesn't hunt that way.

275
01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:15.375
Before the trappers captured me,
it saw me.

276
01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:17.208
It came right up to me

277
01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:19.333
and then left.

278
01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:24.250
It didn't think I was a threat.

279
01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:33.000
You wanna know how I killed that lion?

280
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:37.541
Your plan. The tree.

281
01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:39.166
You weakened it.

282
01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.666
You had it, Naru.

283
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.708
You can see what I miss.

284
01:02:48.708 --> 01:02:50.166
You always have.

285
01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.750
I don't know that this thing
can be killed.

286
01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.916
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

287
01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:12.416
-Now!

288
01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:21.750
Naru.

289
01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:23.583
Naru!

290
01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:52.166
Bastard!

291
01:04:58.791 --> 01:05:00.291
What are you doing?

292
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.375
-I have a plan. Get down.

293
01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:26.916
Do you remember the flood
when we were young?

294
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500
I saw a beaver that had its legs
pinned between two rocks.

295
01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:34.625
The water was rising so fast,
it knew it was going to die.

296
01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:38.791
So it chewed off its own leg.

297
01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:40.625
Shoot !

298
01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:42.083
We'll hit the others!

299
01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:44.875
Shoot!

300
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.541
It was worth it to the beaver…

301
01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:05.125
Wait.

302
01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:06.833
…losing its leg to be free.

303
01:06:06.916 --> 01:06:08.625
Wait. Naru.

304
01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:11.375
What are you doing, Naru? Naru, stop!

305
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:18.125
I'm smarter than a beaver.

306
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:20.333
Come on, we gotta go.

307
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:35.875
-Where are you going?
-I gotta go get us those horses.

308
01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:38.416
I'll get Sarii.

309
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:24.083
Get Away. Move!

310
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.375
Let's hurry up.

311
01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:00.500
I need help.

312
01:08:00.583 --> 01:08:04.041
We can't do anything for them.
We gotta keep moving.

313
01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:05.333
and the dog?

314
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.041
-I like the dog.

315
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:10.166
Knows more than the beaver.

316
01:09:21.583 --> 01:09:23.083
Sarii.

317
01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:24.791
Find, Taabe.

318
01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:26.708
-Go!

319
01:10:22.291 --> 01:10:24.041
Help me! Help.

320
01:10:25.416 --> 01:10:26.583
You have medicine?

321
01:10:38.583 --> 01:10:41.875
Help me, and I'll show you how to use it.

322
01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.458
Please.

323
01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:47.416
Please.

324
01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:10.333
Take the powder
and put it in the gun.

325
01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:13.583
Not too little, not too much.

326
01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:19.666
And then what?

327
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:23.125
Then you take the ball and the cloth.

328
01:11:23.208 --> 01:11:26.000
Put it in the gun.

329
01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:29.750
After that, take the stick you see there.

330
01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:34.208
You put in the gun, uh, three, four times.

331
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:39.958
Last thing.

332
01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:42.541
It's okay.

333
01:11:47.166 --> 01:11:49.333
Put powder here.

334
01:11:49.416 --> 01:11:54.416
Then pull that back and it will fire.

335
01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:56.833
That's all?

336
01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:04.708
Please. It hurts.

337
01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:08.208
Please.

338
01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:15.541
What is it?

339
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.541
What's happening? I'm freezing cold.

340
01:12:38.916 --> 01:12:40.916
Please.

341
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.250
Don't leave me.

342
01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:04.791
It can't see him.

343
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.791
-Hey!

344
01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:46.291
"Not too much, not too little."

345
01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:04.625
Cheat!

346
01:16:18.625 --> 01:16:20.375
We should go.

347
01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:23.125
Taabe.

348
01:16:23.791 --> 01:16:25.666
Run, Naru.

349
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.583
It thinks I'm the threat.

350
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.583
This is as far as I go.

351
01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:34.583
No more. This is it.

352
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:37.458
-No.
-Bring it home.

353
01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:44.833
Non! Ah, non! No, stop!

354
01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:46.083
Whore!

355
01:21:04.416 --> 01:21:06.083
You bled my brother.

356
01:21:08.541 --> 01:21:10.125
So now you bleed.

357
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.625
Idiot Savage!

358
01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:20.166
You think that I am not a hunter like you.

359
01:21:24.875 --> 01:21:28.958
You don't even know the mistake you've made.

360
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.666
That I am not a threat.

361
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:35.291
I'm going to put a bullet in your head.

362
01:21:35.375 --> 01:21:37.458
That is what makes me dangerous.

363
01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:42.458
You're going to die, bitch!

364
01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:46.333
You can't see that I'm killing you.

365
01:22:03.916 --> 01:22:05.875
And it won't either.

366
01:22:34.875 --> 01:22:35.916
Demon!

367
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:39.083
No!

368
01:26:20.416 --> 01:26:21.458
Search!

369
01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:19.500
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

370
01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:20.583
Do it.

371
01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:22.958
Come on, do it.

372
01:27:24.708 --> 01:27:26.541
This is as far as you go.

373
01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:28.375
No more.

374
01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:31.625
This is it.

375
01:28:14.416 --> 01:28:15.958
Naru is coming!

376
01:28:19.375 --> 01:28:22.791
Arüka come! Arüka, Naru is coming.

377
01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:24.291
Naru is here.

378
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.791
What does she have with her?

379
01:28:33.833 --> 01:28:35.208
What does she have with her?

380
01:29:04.791 --> 01:29:07.083
There is danger nearby.

381
01:29:07.166 --> 01:29:09.166
We need to move
to easier protected ground.
