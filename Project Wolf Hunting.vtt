1
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.580
Do you see the criminal
coming out behind me?

2
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.186
After about a year since
the beginning of 2016

3
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.130
The first extradition between the Philippines
and South Korea took place at 4 p.m. today.

4
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.486
For the first time, 47 Korean criminals
who absconded to the philippines

5
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.510
after committing crimes in Korea were
repatriated en masse by chartered flights.

6
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.440
This is police using citizens special
forces and local motorcade personnel...

7
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
Jong Dongbi, you bastard!!

8
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.266
What... Stop him! Stop!

9
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.897
Quick!

10
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.080
You son of bitch!!

11
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.076
Die with me!!

12
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.100
.

13
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.750
2022

14
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.106
September 12th, now.

15
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.790
Burbad, Manila, Philippines.

16
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.236
Korean criminals arrested in the philippines
will be transported to Busan port

17
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.656
in 2 days at 7 p.m. on 14th.

18
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.180
By an international cargo ship departing
Manila Container Terminal at 5 p.m. today.

19
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.310
Considering that a suicide bombing at
the airport during the first repatriation

20
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.126
in 2017 killed seven police officers and
injured more than 30 airport passengers.

21
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.846
The convoy decided to use cargo ship
terminals inaccessible to private citizens.

22
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.346
Therefore, the National Police Agency, in
cooperation with the Busan Port Authority,

23
00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.016
Designated the 58,000-ton bulk carrier
"Frontier Titan" as the escort vessel.

24
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.276
About 20 criminal police officers
with more than 10 years of experience

25
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.696
in violent cases were
assigned to escort the ship.

26
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.076
The wanted criminals were
repatriated as Red Notice criminals,

27
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.616
the highest ranking criminals by Interpol.

28
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.520
Hey, isn't our operation secret?

29
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.900
It was reported in the news.

30
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.410
Good job.

31
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.010
Stay close.

32
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.090
Get off quickly.

33
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.560
Quick, quick.

34
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.270
Get out of the bus quickly.

35
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.350
Get up.

36
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.496
I'm just telling you to
spread your legs a bit.

37
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.377
Get up quicky.

38
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:58.560
OK OK.

39
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.190
Where?

40
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.530
Let's go, let's go.

41
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040
Don't touch me, shit.

42
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.750
Hey this way.

43
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.880
Ah the smell of shit, f♪♪k.

44
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.890
Lee Dong II, Red Scar,
Lee Sang-moo, get on board!

45
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.980
I thought you retired long ago.

46
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.900
Your daughter has become a woman.

47
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040
Jungu.

48
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.000
You stupid bastard.

49
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.670
Since you're in school you
should listen to your teachers.

50
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.170
What kind of attitude is that?

51
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.140
I saw the photos and was very impressed.

52
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.576
How the f♪♪k can the
interpol beat a person up.

53
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.980
This is not right.

54
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.830
How come the wind is so strong?

55
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.976
Let go, let go.

56
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.330
Let me go, f♪♪k.

57
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.420
Sorry.

58
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.380
It's already a mess and
I want to go on a trip.

59
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.260
Senior, What are those people for?

60
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.350
It's a doctor and a nurse.

61
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.650
It seems that all the Korean
criminals are in the Philippines.

62
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.626
It said the police hospital staff
couldn't get out, so yesterday I was...

63
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.530
I'm already tired of it.

64
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.450
Shouldn't I come?

65
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.516
Let go of me, let go of me, you bastard.

66
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.580
Tear him apart, the stupid bastard.

67
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.380
- OK OK.
- What the fuck are you guys looking at?

68
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.710
Get on board.

69
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.880
Yes.

70
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.890
Hey you punk.

71
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.270
Nice to meet you, let's go.

72
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:47.610
.

73
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.910
Quick.

74
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.546
What are you doing?

75
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.570
What?

76
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.280
What the hell are you doing?

77
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.330
Attention.

78
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.830
Attention!

79
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.120
I'll keep it short.

80
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.350
I am the leader of the Central Commando.

81
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.856
Our team will be responsible for all
security control tasks in the border area.

82
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.550
It is a prisoner escort
team from the Philippines.

83
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.366
So you can go out the same door you
came to work through in the morning.

84
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.100
No, Hey.

85
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.680
What are you barging in to say?

86
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.270
I didn't get orders like that.

87
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.110
I'm giving you the order now.

88
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.490
I'll give you ten minutes.

89
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.080
Project the vtos on the front
screen and prepare the setup.

90
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.027
Project Wolf Hunting.

91
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:03.430
Why can't we fly in a plane?

92
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.076
Let go of me.

93
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.966
What's all this bullshit
about getting on a plane.

94
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.030
Dumb shit.

95
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.926
Just let us go like this.

96
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.280
Shut up, dumbass.

97
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.420
Get in.

98
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.290
Be gentle, be gentle.

99
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:38.630
Murder under Article 250 of the
Penal Code, on or about April 23, 2013.

100
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.786
According to the principle of secularism,
from now on, this ship is Korean territory

101
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.810
and does not belong to
the Philippines anymore.

102
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.020
Park Jung-Do.

103
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:56.350
September 12, 16:20, according to
Article 250 of the Criminal Code, 12, 1,

104
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.330
you are a teacher who raped and
killed 13 people, 300 weeks escape time.

105
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.830
Sorry officer, I've been
having trouble with my ankle.

106
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.000
Can you help me unshackle my feet?

107
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.510
Do Soo-hwa, 261 incidents
of special atrocities.

108
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.770
Interpol Red List.

109
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:33.100
In short, you can get a lawyer to represent
you, appeal, and apply for a denial of arrest.

110
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.650
OK?

111
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.040
Oh F♪♪k

112
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.170
It's going to be like
that all the way to Korea.

113
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.420
Hey, be gentle, you bitch.

114
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.840
Who do you think I am?

115
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.220
Hey, don't touch me.

116
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.230
Hey, be gentle. My skin is very delicate.

117
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.047
Choi Myong-joo.

118
00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:15.530
You are accused of killing your spouse and
in-laws under Article 250 of the Penal Code.

119
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.370
Attention!!

120
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:34.316
Meals twice a day, bathroom once a day,
and no toothbrush for the safety of all.

121
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.260
Ah... What the F♪♪k.

122
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.956
I don't understand what human rights
are because I'm with such dumbasses.

123
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.310
There is no CCTV here either.

124
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:50.126
So, if you want to eat well before
returning to your long-lost homeland.

125
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.690
Just please, don't toss and
turn, and behave yourselves.

126
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.820
If they roll up and leave,
you won't just be hungry.

127
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.830
Thanks for your hard
work, this side is ready.

128
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.170
Okay, we will leave the port as soon as
we get permission from the control center.

129
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.760
All sections, stand by.

130
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.890
Everyone has done their homework, right?

131
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.060
Don't forget the emergency rule that you
can't take your eyes off all these people

132
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.866
even one second before you arrive.

133
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.246
What happened last time, even
if you don't say it, we all know.

134
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.360
Do not let your guard down, got it?

135
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.530
Yes, sir.

136
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.040
Greetings, Captain. This is the
busan Port Special Control Office.

137
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.266
Please always make sure the
VFC remains on channel 16.

138
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.016
MBDP transmission and
reception are confirmed.

139
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.880
I have also contacted the local
MICCs in the Philippines and Taiwan.

140
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.090
The ship's security alarm
system is operating normally.

141
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.550
"Frontier Titan" departed
promptly at 17:00 Philippine time.

142
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.180
The tugboat is below.

143
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.820
I saw it.

144
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.700
Did you bring a lot of money?

145
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.250
I don't think so.

146
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.510
Ah yes.

147
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.640
Doctor, maybe you brought
something like alcohol?

148
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.576
No, I can't drink.

149
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.480
What a shame, I would have
loved to have a refreshing beer.

150
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.610
What to do?

151
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.910
There are only 5 weeks
left until I go home.

152
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.580
Our youngest must have
forgotten all about his father's face.

153
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.210
Why are we doing this?

154
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.500
Ah, shit.

155
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.750
Don't get annoyed.

156
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.050
It's like ordering
Seolleon in the West Sea.

157
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.100
These criminals have a good life.

158
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.746
Feed them, put them to
sleep, and get them for free.

159
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.850
These pussies.

160
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.270
I know you are annoyed
and sensitive, but bear with it.

161
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.690
Just three days, just three days.

162
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.747
Good.

163
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:27.320
You go inside and take a break.

164
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.110
We'll get the meal done.

165
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.490
OK.

166
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.250
Hello.

167
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.500
Are you the doctor?

168
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:42.830
Yeah, Yeah.

169
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.766
We're cooking right now.

170
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.340
No.

171
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.840
I'll will take it away.

172
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.356
I'm off.

173
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.317
Okay.

174
00:14:51.341 --> 00:14:53.066
Take care of Da-yeon and
Seo-joon, they take care of your meals

175
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.447
because there are no
shifts for them to do it.

176
00:14:55.471 --> 00:15:00.060
Ah, thank you both for your help.

177
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.900
Good bye brother.

178
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.350
Okay, got it.

179
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.520
Red slow.

180
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.520
Yes, we are now heading out for departure.

181
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.296
Well, let's eat first.

182
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.047
Thanks.

183
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:30.351
There's something for us, right?

184
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.580
Hey man, it's delcious.

185
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.830
That's how you do it.

186
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.250
Hey, don't fart, eat well.

187
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.420
Ok.

188
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.140
It's too noisy.

189
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200
Eat.

190
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.410
Move your legs away.

191
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.750
Move your legs you stupid cunt.

192
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.170
You're still laughing?

193
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.210
Isn't that crazy, stupid.

194
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.100
You eat.

195
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.980
Here you go.

196
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.280
Cross-legged.

197
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.620
Cross-legged.

198
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.660
Are you the only one to drink?

199
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.090
Got it.

200
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.666
Ah, let's go.

201
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.297
- Is that okay?
- Excuse me.

202
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.710
Hello.

203
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.130
I ate and brought you something.

204
00:19:53.100 --> 00:20:01.100
.

205
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.680
Oh...

206
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.530
Do i just... need to put sleeping pills in?

207
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.716
Can I touch it directly with my hand?

208
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.250
Don't think too much.

209
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.750
Just finish what you have to do and leave.

210
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:14.270
Currently, latitude 18.6, longitude
189.38, cruising speed 12 knots.

211
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.900
It has passed through the high seas.

212
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.860
Current weather conditions?

213
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.580
A rainstorm warning has been issued
from Philipine waters until the buoy.

214
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:31.186
It is expected to advance 30 per hour with a
wind speed of 13.5m, equivalent to 4th level.

215
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.880
That's enough.

216
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.016
Just pay attention to safety,
there are no flammable

217
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.686
and explosive materials
in the cargo hold, right?

218
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.220
None. Only cement and iron ore.

219
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.710
In seven minutes, we will enter the
international waters of Titano, border Titano.

220
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.796
Twelve years have passed.

221
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.416
The child was born.

222
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.166
I carried him around.

223
00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.740
Patrolling around, lurking around.

224
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.636
It's really crazy that it took
about 2 weeks to catch.

225
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.460
Brother, do you know
where you caught him from?

226
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.330
You know busking, right?

227
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:19.566
Lately the kids have been singing
and dancing and playing instruments.

228
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.527
Busking?

229
00:23:20.551 --> 00:23:22.140
Yeah, busking.

230
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.156
That's where he was caught.

231
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.640
Hey, these people have
no reason but have sense.

232
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.270
Don't mention it.

233
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.320
But it's not like this guy
has a cell phone or anything.

234
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.876
So I asked, "Where's your cell phone?"

235
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.876
Turns out he said he left
it in the bathroom at home.

236
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.506
The Bathroom?

237
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.087
Yeah.

238
00:23:40.111 --> 00:23:47.476
I went to look for it, and it
was behind the bathroom door.

239
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.580
There were three of us.

240
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.090
Gotcha! Number 3!

241
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.640
Panicked and surprised again, right?

242
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:07.850
Scared?

243
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:29.200
Just grab him at once, shake shake.

244
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.170
Did I make a mistake? That
was already three years ago.

245
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.500
Until now

246
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.356
Look at this

247
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.380
How is this

248
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.850
Look at this.

249
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.836
What a life this is. I'm going to bed.

250
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.066
But it's almost time
for my shift. I'm so tired.

251
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.710
So why start playing cards.

252
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.920
Shit.

253
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.180
What's that?

254
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.150
Ah you stupid bastard.

255
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.940
I told you to put the gun
in, what are you looking at.

256
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.030
Good evening.

257
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.450
Shit.

258
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.660
You can't watch movies
in foreign countries.

259
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.080
Am I the only one?

260
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.840
F♪♪k.

261
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.380
What the hell.

262
00:26:53.100 --> 00:27:01.100
.

263
00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.890
He took out all the
boxes for the prisoners.

264
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.720
I would really be crazy if
it wasn't for President Jo.

265
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.456
They are the police,
they should get this right.

266
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.230
That's right.

267
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.520
It's a police matter.

268
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.020
Okay.

269
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.836
So when is it going to rain?

270
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.386
Then the song will be interrupted again.

271
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.040
It says it's going to rain at
09:00. It's to going to come.

272
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.620
What's the matter?

273
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.020
It takes you guys to drive the ship, right?

274
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.640
Yes, Yes.

275
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.990
Turn on the roof light.

276
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.520
Where's the contact signal
coming from on the Korean side?

277
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120
There.

278
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.470
What?

279
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.720
How did this happen?

280
00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.180
Team Leader.

281
00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.810
The signal was cut off.

282
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.640
What does that mean?

283
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.626
It looks like it disappeared.

284
00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:05.756
What are you talking about?

285
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.070
Is it an AIS malfunction?

286
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.400
Hurry up and connect to the VHF.

287
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.910
Yes, got it.

288
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.710
What about the security alert system?

289
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.586
There was little response.

290
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.650
I think it was cut off
without an emergency signal.

291
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.226
I can't connect to VHF.

292
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.340
Since Both are disconnected from the AIS,

293
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.620
I don't think it's a mere fault problem.

294
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.196
Dumbass, did I ask what you think?

295
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.216
Did I, punk?

296
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.026
Don't think you're so good that you
have to teach me how to do things.

297
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.370
Don't just bring up problems, bring up
countermeasures. What about countermeasures?

298
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.980
Call IMA to reset the satellite signal.

299
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.836
Got it?

300
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.090
Roger that.

301
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.160
A1, A1, F, are you there?

302
00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.006
What's wrong? Is something suddenly wrong?

303
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.710
The signal seems to be bad. Wait a minute.

304
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.410
This is A1 Lee Dayeon.

305
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.080
Is F there?

306
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.670
Team leader Lee Seong-ho?

307
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.840
Anyone who can hear me, please reply.

308
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.630
A1, A1.

309
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.970
Please reply. What to
reply you bunch of idiots.

310
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.996
I'll go find the team leader
first, I-'ll be back in a minute.

311
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:03.916
It's not like it's been a malfunction
twice, so don't run around.

312
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.570
Don't get into trouble.

313
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:08.070
Senior.

314
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.030
Suit yourself.

315
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:18.920
Hey, is there a young
male detective? Please.

316
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.960
F♪♪king bitch.

317
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.340
What the heck.

318
00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.456
A1, A1.

319
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.440
Will you shut up?

320
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.740
But sister, my stomach hurts a little.

321
00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.370
Can I go to the bathroom?

322
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.000
Hey.

323
00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.420
Yes we are sitting down.

324
00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.170
Don't sleep.

325
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.150
Hey, what's up?

326
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.160
I asked you what you're doing?

327
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.910
Shit, hey.

328
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.130
Sorry Sorry Sorry.

329
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.800
What the hell? Are you crazy?

330
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.010
Who are you?

331
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.310
Douchebags.

332
00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.900
Ah f♪♪k, what a pain in the ass.

333
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.896
I already checked the
location you mentioned,

334
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.880
there's no problems
with the site right now.

335
00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.670
None of the other ships
around made a claim.

336
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.276
Did you check the problem inside the ship?

337
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.366
I'm not sure but... we're checking
everything might happened.

338
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.406
I don't think there's
problem inside the ship.

339
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.446
Emergency situation occurred!

340
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.810
Emergency situation occurred!

341
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.580
Help.

342
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.830
Brother.

343
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.430
Let them go first, I
guess they are all waiting.

344
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:45.930
Okay.

345
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.350
Wait.

346
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.440
Give me the knife.

347
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.040
Except for the guys on the phone right now.

348
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:20.510
The others find the satellite image
of the ship from the last position.

349
00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.390
Look for the Chinese or
Japanese Meteorological Agency,

350
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.100
or anything that can find them.

351
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.520
Make sure you catch them.

352
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.840
How nice.

353
00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.890
1, 2, 3.1, 2, 3.

354
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.900
Can anyone hear me? Please reply.

355
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.900
A1, A1, seniors.

356
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.540
Oh.

357
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.630
Don't move.

358
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.300
I'm a doctor, doctor.

359
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.197
- I know, but why did you come out of there?
- Ah.

360
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:26.980
Lee Dayeon, What are you doing in
there? Why did you take the gun out?

361
00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.690
Okay, I'm sorry.

362
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.060
I'm sorry, doctor.

363
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:32.470
She was trying to do her duty.

364
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:38.176
I've been looking for leader. Is everyone's
internet and walkie-talkies down?

365
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.910
Yes, none of ours are working,
so we're going to make sure.

366
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.080
There's someone over there.

367
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.370
Brother, over there.

368
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:48.870
What's he doing.

369
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.146
Isn't that an axe he's holding?

370
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.590
These fools really, over there.

371
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.560
What am i going to do?

372
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.610
Let's go.

373
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.620
Thank you, thank you.

374
00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.790
Only now it feels alive.

375
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.300
Thank you.

376
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.390
Who gave you this special f♪♪king pardon?

377
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.690
Hey, where are the pussies?

378
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.240
One of them is cute.

379
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.200
Hey, wanna come along?

380
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.426
F♪♪k off.

381
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.160
Hey, you want to go too?

382
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.680
That bitch is mine.

383
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:20.430
Jung Do.

384
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.730
What are these idiots doing.

385
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.440
It's been a long time
since I've used it. It's nice.

386
00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.360
Who's this?

387
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.620
You know that artist too, right?

388
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.700
He doesn't need a knife either.
He's a gentlemen, Lee Dong-il.

389
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.710
It's really alarming to
see you look so pathetic.

390
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.000
I haven't seen it in about 10 years.

391
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.920
How come you haven't seen it once?

392
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.010
What are you doing now?

393
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.890
Can't you see it?

394
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.930
I'm running away in
order to live like a human.

395
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.166
But you stinking idiot, I saved
you, you should say thank you.

396
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.666
You ungrateful douche bag.

397
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.290
Just be a good boy and go back to Korea.

398
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.780
Don't do something you regret.

399
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.410
What kind of pussy talk is that?

400
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.080
Are there any dumbasses
here who want to go to Korea?

401
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.340
Raise you hand.

402
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.840
It's gonna be so easy.

403
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.750
What are you doing?

404
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.550
You son of a bitch.

405
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.060
Shit

406
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.860
Don't move.

407
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.860
Senior.

408
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.940
I told you to be gentle.

409
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.740
Anyway, I can't listen to
anything when I'm excited.

410
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.096
Brother, just help us wash the dishes.

411
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.710
Why do i have to do the dishes every day?

412
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.710
I'll take care of Myong-joo
when I'm doing it.

413
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.090
If that's the case, it's already messed up.

414
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.920
You know how to go back, right.

415
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.980
Those who want to follow will
come, those who don't want to follow,

416
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.020
watch out for themselves, damn it.

417
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.460
See you soon.

418
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.380
Shit, I was going to kill him.

419
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.140
But it's still going to Korea.

420
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.230
It's going crazy how things
have turned out this way.

421
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.370
Ah shit, these idiots
are really getting to me.

422
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:22.920
Your people are dead, what are
you going to do, you stupid cunt.

423
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.470
What are you talking about? Your
people are dead you stupid cunt.

424
00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.100
By now Jung-do should have
finished the job beautifully.

425
00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.020
Park Jung-do... Crazy bastard.

426
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.780
Drop the gun.

427
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:56.960
Put the gun down!!

428
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.550
Stand up.

429
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.120
Lee Dayeon take cover.

430
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:48.630
Is everything okay?

431
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.700
Are you okay?

432
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:19.460
I know you're tired, is there
any way to reach Korea?

433
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.460
Engine room, Satellite phone.

434
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:24.920
Hmm?

435
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:43.900
That was gunfire, wasn't it?

436
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.700
How did you hear the sound of gunfire?

437
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.780
Must have been fixing something.

438
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:50.330
But where did you get the beer?

439
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.136
When I went to the
restaurant, there was beer there.

440
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.476
Would you like to join me for a drink?

441
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.040
No, I can't drink.

442
00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.226
But where have you been?

443
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.670
Oh, down there. That's not important.

444
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.146
That's the sound of gunfire.

445
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.840
On my way here, I met the
interrogators with their guns.

446
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.196
If you're so worried, I'll go
out and see what's going on.

447
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.470
Don't go out there.

448
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.826
There are a lot of criminals out there.

449
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.480
How can a doctor be so timid.

450
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.980
You're not very attractive
to women, are you, doctor?

451
00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.160
What a lack of charm.

452
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:28.450
You have so little guts.

453
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:30.540
It's okay, it's okay.

454
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.580
The fortune teller said this
year that I have bad fortune.

455
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.670
You really do everything.

456
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:47.850
If it's so good, why don't you drink it.

457
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.570
You have worked hard.

458
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.830
It's all moved over.

459
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.080
Good.

460
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.970
No soju now.

461
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:29.260
You smoke a cigarette
and go somewhere nice.

462
00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.680
Now this is not a problem, right?

463
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.940
You guys can't come down
here for that. Please go up.

464
00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.960
It's okay, don't be afraid.

465
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.130
Where's the satellite phone?

466
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.710
EC.

467
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.356
Say something understandable, dammit.

468
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.640
Engine control room over there.

469
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:31.850
Those two guys, you go
over there and smash it.

470
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.440
You go along too.

471
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.460
Seniors.

472
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.300
What?

473
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:37.526
F♪♪k.

474
00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:38.550
Where did they all go?

475
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:49.520
Where are the others?

476
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.650
I don't know.

477
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.450
We acted immediately
after we heard the shots.

478
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.320
The bastards ended up in trouble.

479
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.120
Communications were all cut off too.

480
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:07.160
They were prepared
before they got on the ship.

481
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.120
We need to tell the Korean
side of the situation first.

482
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.170
It says that the engine
room can contact with Korea.

483
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:42.870
Why did you bring this uncle?

484
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.210
Without me, the boat would have stopped.

485
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:54.026
That's what they said.

486
00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:56.260
I'm the chief engineer.

487
00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:02.220
Forget it, get him done, let's go.

488
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:03.510
Good.

489
00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:05.020
Let's go.

490
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.310
Uncle you get off work.

491
00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:21.830
What are you doing?

492
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.620
Don't go too far.

493
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.290
Park Jung-do, you jerk.

494
00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:36.930
This dumbass.

495
00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:39.010
You can't shoot here.

496
00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.220
The boat will stop.

497
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.736
There's an engine here.

498
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.470
It's noisy, you stupid bastard.

499
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.860
F♪♪k, can the police
shoot at people like that?

500
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.690
It's self-defense from
now on, you assholes.

501
00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:56.530
I'm not from this side! Please help me.

502
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.550
Kids, take care of them.

503
00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:33.900
What is it? Still alive?

504
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.200
Nobody move!

505
00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:43.726
I'm sure it's this style,
how can you not die.

506
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:46.120
Don't look, don't look.

507
00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:53.316
I said don't move, dumbass.

508
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.300
Jung-do, I told you, this is
not a boat you can escape from.

509
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.850
I'm so mad, Who's the one
who should escape now?

510
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.400
Stick a knife in your
mouth, for f♪♪k's sake.

511
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.610
F♪♪k!

512
00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:11.690
Stupid motherf♪♪ker!

513
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.760
Hide, hide!

514
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:42.250
Shit!

515
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.060
Brother, brother, quick.

516
00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.820
Shit.

517
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:50.280
Out of the way, damn it.

518
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:23.980
Stinky bitch, shit.

519
00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.330
F♪♪k all of you, you stupid bastards.

520
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.200
F♪♪k you.

521
01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.840
Nothing is different.

522
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:09.490
This is hell.

523
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.690
Hurry up.

524
01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.720
There is a exit.

525
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Just shoot.

526
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:31.670
Come on.

527
01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.820
Hurry up.

528
01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:20.720
His prison clothes are very old.

529
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:25.170
I have been in prison for 30 years.

530
01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.580
We should get treatment.

531
01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.820
Let's go.

532
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.440
Officer.

533
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.200
A photo is sent to us by MRCC
from the sea area near Taiwan.

534
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.500
The location is finally
captured very near from us.

535
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.400
Enlarge the photo.

536
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.730
When is it sent?

537
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160
About 30 minutes ago.

538
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.630
It doesn't look like the ship is sinking.

539
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.480
Enlarge more.

540
01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:00.680
The stern looks fine.

541
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.550
What is that?

542
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:04.780
Why is it red over there?

543
01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.270
Enlarge that area.

544
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.340
F♪♪k.

545
01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:19.630
I knew. The criminals are going to do evil.

546
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.906
What is the police doing on the ship?

547
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:28.400
Son of a bitch.

548
01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.300
Director Pyo

549
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:52.250
Report?

550
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.040
You are joking.

551
01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:55.830
You are too arrogant.

552
01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:00.050
I am doing my job as you have asked.

553
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:01.347
I already knew about the situation.

554
01:06:01.371 --> 01:06:02.510
The situation?

555
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:04.560
Don't talk too much.

556
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.060
Just make it simple.

557
01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:08.920
Officer Oh, you should
go there by yourself.

558
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:10.860
Go there by myself? Me?

559
01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.490
The ship is coming now.

560
01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:17.520
Oh my, you are really out of you mind.

561
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.640
Do you think coastguards and
Ministry of Defense will support us?

562
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:25.280
There are dozens of people on
that ship. How can I catch that guy?

563
01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:27.696
You should say something realistic.

564
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:34.190
It was you who said it's fine to let
him get on the ship and lose all faculties.

565
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.866
It was you who said...

566
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:38.890
F♪♪k. Then what do you want me to do?

567
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.700
I only said alpha should get on the ship.

568
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.526
I didn't say the criminals
should be there too.

569
01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:46.100
Now things have gone really bad.

570
01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.110
But why should that blame on me?

571
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.680
It's you that pretend to know nothing.

572
01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:53.486
What do you want me to do?

573
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.000
Son of a bitch.

574
01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840
Listen.

575
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.200
The naval base you will see in
front of it belongs to The U.S. Army.

576
01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.900
Just shut up.

577
01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:23.840
And bring alpha to me.

578
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.750
Hey, you son of a bitch.

579
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.540
Hey.

580
01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.980
F♪♪k.

581
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:03.270
Son of a bitch.

582
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:05.810
Shut up.

583
01:08:19.570 --> 01:08:20.217
You have no manners.

584
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:21.641
You should knock on the door first.

585
01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:24.610
Is it your first time seeing
someone in the toilet?

586
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160
Why are you so late?

587
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:29.610
Tell me the truth.

588
01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:30.940
Did you forget me?

589
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.360
What are you talking about?

590
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:34.910
All in all, I came.

591
01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.760
Nonsense.

592
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.240
Hello.

593
01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:40.680
Hi.

594
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.510
What's that all over your body.

595
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:46.976
F♪♪k, you're driving
me crazy. Just Stop it.

596
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.320
Hey.

597
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:50.470
I gave you money, right?

598
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.510
Shit. Can you see this?

599
01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.220
Can you?

600
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:55.350
Can you?

601
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.090
You should have done it well.

602
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400
Turn around.

603
01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:05.630
Why are you always sitting at here?

604
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.850
I need to change my clothes.

605
01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.410
But I don't have any.

606
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.740
You crazy bitch.

607
01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:13.100
Help me with this.

608
01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.756
What a psycho.

609
01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:23.876
Don't follow me.

610
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.656
You said you would help me.

611
01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.700
When?

612
01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:37.810
Hurry up.

613
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.990
What's going on?

614
01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.760
You were nervous too much.

615
01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.580
Why do you sleep in my room?

616
01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.066
Sir, wake up.

617
01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:24.000
I heard something weird.

618
01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:25.870
Is it the sound of shooting?

619
01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:28.430
You always say it's shooting.

620
01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.280
No, it's not.

621
01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:35.930
It sounds like wailing.

622
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.870
Or maybe it's something fell down.

623
01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.880
It's lifeboat.

624
01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:00.640
But why is it loosened?

625
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:37.256
Help! Help!

626
01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.040
Sir, WHat's going on?

627
01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:40.560
There's no time.

628
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:41.830
He's chasing after me.

629
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:43.176
Just let me go.

630
01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.060
He did that in front of me.

631
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.590
Why are you always treating me like this?

632
01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.940
Calm down.

633
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:53.140
What did you just say?

634
01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.780
She's dead.

635
01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.970
He's in the medical room now.

636
01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:01.370
It's there undoubtedly.

637
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:02.790
I gave hypnotic...

638
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:05.890
Say it clear.

639
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:14.210
The monster's eyes are sewed up just like a
dead body and he wears the clothes like that.

640
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:18.270
What's that?

641
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.560
Tell us everything.

642
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:21.130
I have no idea.

643
01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:22.810
I just follow the orders.

644
01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.020
What are you asked to do, bastard?

645
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.400
I took annual leave.

646
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:39.836
He asked me to give hypnotic every
six hours and offered me a lot of money.

647
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.490
I only followed the order.

648
01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.780
Is it the association?

649
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.100
Yes.

650
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.700
Is it the place that sells you vitamins
that makes you ten years younger?

651
01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.140
Yes.

652
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:59.870
There are faculties from
the company in my room.

653
01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.580
They probably know about this.

654
01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.690
Whatever.

655
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:09.970
There's medicine on the lifeboat, right?

656
01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.940
Yes, but it is destroyed.

657
01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.060
Oh no.

658
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:25.030
I have put some in the basement.

659
01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.100
Go check it.

660
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:31.200
I will find others.

661
01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840
Alone?

662
01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.720
No, It's too dangerous.

663
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:37.097
I will go with you.

664
01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.290
It's all right.

665
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:43.090
There should be at least
one police to go and search.

666
01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.360
However...

667
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:51.470
Let's go.

668
01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920
Let's Hurry up.

669
01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:18.810
Jung Du is in the engine room.

670
01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.320
My Jung Du.

671
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:23.310
He finally can get out of the jail.

672
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:27.510
Although he is rude,
he is quite clever, right?

673
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:11.820
What the hell, you son of a bitch.

674
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:41.630
Who are you?

675
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.600
Let's leave.

676
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.980
Sir.

677
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.620
I say, just go.

678
01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.900
Hurry up, bitch.

679
01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:18.510
Help, Help.

680
01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400
Hurry up.

681
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:53.020
Where is the destination?

682
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:56.350
Hey.

683
01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:57.850
Quiet.

684
01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.590
The door shouldn't be opened.

685
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:14.910
What are these?

686
01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.080
Oh my god.

687
01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.130
Sir.

688
01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.820
Let's go.

689
01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:47.310
What's this?

690
01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:55.760
Come here.

691
01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:57.530
My legs.

692
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:02.820
It's a slight scratch.

693
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.260
The wound seems not so deep.

694
01:20:05.710 --> 01:20:07.190
This is gonna hurt.

695
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:09.650
Easy. Easy.

696
01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:12.400
Do you need treatment?

697
01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.400
Didn't you get hurt?

698
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.760
I see you bleeding.

699
01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.080
It's kind of painful.

700
01:20:22.210 --> 01:20:23.940
We don't have anesthetic.

701
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:28.880
Please do it gently.

702
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:30.870
Ok, I will.

703
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:49.230
This is Japanese.

704
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.860
This is the criminal we just met.

705
01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.570
His name is Kim Wan Gyu.

706
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:09.310
He was born in 1911.

707
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.310
1911?

708
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:14.230
He's about my grandfather's age.

709
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:17.950
This doesn't make sense.

710
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:22.360
He was imprisoned in
Korea, Ceong Do Bu in 1943.

711
01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.141
He joined Japan's aggressive
war against the Philippines.

712
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:32.100
He was put inside of a Japanese POW
camp on the west side of Mindanao Island.

713
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.710
He received an AA level diagnosis which is

714
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:42.240
the most idealistic result in the Japanese
experiment of inventing human weapons.

715
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:43.980
A human weapon?

716
01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:46.190
Experiment?

717
01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.806
What on earth...

718
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:48.830
Let me help you.

719
01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:54.320
That is, he has been alive from then on.

720
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:57.760
But why is it a secret?

721
01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.260
Follow me.

722
01:22:19.570 --> 01:22:20.570
Come here.

723
01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:25.540
Be quick.

724
01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.020
What are you doing? Come on.

725
01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.430
Experiment subject Alpha.

726
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:13.240
Experiment subject Alpha has the side effect
of conducting indiscriminate violence.

727
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:20.430
And it shows that Alpha
suffers from severe trauma.

728
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.330
Why does it stop?

729
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.990
Why does it stop?

730
01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.990
Just go down quickly.

731
01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:05.860
Alpha only reacts to people's behaviour.

732
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:08.720
It preserves the genetic
characteristics of wolf.

733
01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:13.790
And it's sensitive about
sound and the smell of blood.

734
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:20.140
It is 5 times stronger than normal human.

735
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.700
Get down.

736
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.760
Oh shit, Its not opening.

737
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:32.820
It won't open.

738
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:40.590
What's more, according to the fact that
cellular aging doesn't happen on its body.

739
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:49.710
It can live much longer which indicates
the new possibility of human's evolution.

740
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.800
It's the same as cancer cell.

741
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.850
They are crazy.

742
01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.990
How much longer do people want to be alive?

743
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:08.350
The whole world is crazy.

744
01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.460
Are there more about Alpha?

745
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.690
Wait a second.

746
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:14.690
I think we can find more.

747
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:16.470
I will take a look.

748
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:33.900
The third laboratory is Japan's
concentration camp in the Philippines.

749
01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.380
Stop taking photos.

750
01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:25.250
The surgery has finished successfully.

751
01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:06.210
What's going on?

752
01:27:30.150 --> 01:27:32.780
Kill it.

753
01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040
Bastard.

754
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:52.890
Help!

755
01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:55.220
Don't come to me. Go away.

756
01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:04.730
Hold on.

757
01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.300
Stop it.

758
01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:02.540
Let him go.

759
01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.520
Sir, sir, do something.

760
01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.500
Help!

761
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.840
Son of a bitch.

762
01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.157
I won't let you go.

763
01:29:52.181 --> 01:29:53.400
Let's die together.

764
01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:56.090
No.

765
01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:02.840
My dear.

766
01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.140
My dear.

767
01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:07.117
I am sorry.

768
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:11.450
Shit, just get up now.

769
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:28.390
What's that sound?

770
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.130
Let's go.

771
01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.280
OK.

772
01:30:39.970 --> 01:30:40.970
My dear.

773
01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:51.916
Go.

774
01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.940
Hurry up.

775
01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.320
Officer, this is Kim Tae Jun speaking.

776
01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.520
Frontier Titan has been
found 20 minutes ago.

777
01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:09.830
It is detected as remaining still.

778
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.960
Ok.

779
01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.380
Get ready.

780
01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160
What's that.

781
01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:26.220
Come on.

782
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:45.447
What are you doing?

783
01:32:45.471 --> 01:32:46.660
Don't come out.

784
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:55.470
Shit.

785
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:20.560
I should at least break your arm so that

786
01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.850
I can say something to my
friends who have been sacrificed.

787
01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:29.690
Son of a bitch.

788
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.620
It's the sound of helicopter.

789
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.750
They come to save us, right?

790
01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.120
Did you contact Korean government?

791
01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.660
- No, there's no signal.
- Maybe it's captain.

792
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:39.420
Yes, that's it.

793
01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:41.760
Where are you going?

794
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:43.070
Be quick.

795
01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.300
Wait for me.

796
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:15.590
Are you the guys with helicopter?

797
01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.300
Those people are...

798
01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:37.600
There's a psycho acting like a
monster and killing everyone.

799
01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:39.120
Like a monster?

800
01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.276
The police are also killed.

801
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:43.736
The monster is killing everyone.

802
01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.920
And he kills people like he kills a bug.

803
01:37:46.930 --> 01:37:47.690
I have no idea.

804
01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:49.180
I don't know.

805
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.086
I have no idea.

806
01:37:50.110 --> 01:37:50.740
I need to get out of here.

807
01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.990
Help me.

808
01:37:57.230 --> 01:37:59.620
Bitch, you are too noisy.

809
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:02.840
Blah Blah blah, you are talking too much.

810
01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:04.660
I have no time.

811
01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.460
I am the police.

812
01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:22.150
Don't move.

813
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.970
What are you showing off, bitch?

814
01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:36.090
You should have done your job better.

815
01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.350
I just need you to arrive Taiwan.

816
01:38:40.890 --> 01:38:41.890
Is it so hard?

817
01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:47.920
Shit, all of you are dumb.

818
01:38:58.810 --> 01:38:59.810
Let's go.

819
01:39:00.090 --> 01:39:01.090
Let's go.

820
01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:02.930
Put down your guns.

821
01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:05.890
Who are you?

822
01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:10.220
You are still contemptible.

823
01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:20.120
It's you, bastard.

824
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.960
How have you been?

825
01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.120
You expect to get on the ship with Alpha
and arrive in Korea to find us, right?

826
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:49.480
That's why you give me so much trouble.

827
01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.810
You should have known.

828
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:54.750
Why did you do that?

829
01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.000
What are you talking about?

830
01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:03.250
We make a good use of those
people who are going to die.

831
01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.600
Is that wrong?

832
01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:07.200
It's not me.

833
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.680
Don't lie to me.

834
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.480
You kill them.

835
01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:13.450
No.

836
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:15.450
I said it's not me.

837
01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:16.920
Go to hell.

838
01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:36.460
Today's goods are so fresh.

839
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.550
Son of a bitch.

840
01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:45.770
Hurry up and pack them up.

841
01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.700
Come on, pigs.

842
01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.206
It's lucnch time.

843
01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:48.230
Come on, pigs.

844
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:49.790
Come on, pigs.

845
01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:06.206
Today's winner in the game
earns 30 points more than the loser.

846
01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:07.240
Are you all right?

847
01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.870
We saved you.

848
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:24.750
But you bastards don't know how
to be grateful and bring me trouble.

849
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.640
You won't get hurt and old.

850
01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.220
It's so wonderful.

851
01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:33.480
I understand.

852
01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.100
You should have come with the faculty.

853
01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.730
Why did you make me find you by myself?

854
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:51.460
Is it a son or a daughter?

855
01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:55.290
It has been a long time
ago. I don't even remember.

856
01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.990
Son of a bitch.

857
01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.750
That guy appears again.

858
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.340
Oh no.

859
01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.940
Why does this guy intervene.

860
01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:43.220
Let's just take his head.

861
01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.140
Fire.

862
01:45:48.490 --> 01:45:49.516
These guys are useless.

863
01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:50.540
Hilarious

864
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:11.030
Come this way.

865
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:12.070
Come on.

866
01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.960
Actually, It's a pity to kill you.

867
01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.040
Don't move.

868
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Who are you?

869
01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:08.580
You don't need to know.

870
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.100
Take us to Korea.

871
01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:12.260
I can't.

872
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:14.070
The helicopter needs refueling.

873
01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:19.880
Shit, What can we do?

874
01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:24.000
Find out the nearest place to go.

875
01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:26.000
Please get out of this place.

876
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:18.590
What a pity.

877
01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:48.600
This bastard has died.

878
01:48:49.810 --> 01:48:52.390
I should at least take you
back so that I won't be blamed.

879
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:54.810
Am I right?

880
01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:10.780
Animals shouldn't imitate humans.

881
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:31.770
Just come with me
when I talk gently to you.

882
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:56.880
Otherwise, things will
be really bad for you.

883
01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:00.920
Now I remember when I see you like this.

884
01:51:01.890 --> 01:51:03.810
Father, father.

885
01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:08.360
Now I remember your baby's face.

886
01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:31.100
.

887
01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:24.590
It's not easy to move them.

888
01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:31.450
It's a better idea that we should
get it done here instead of in Korea.

889
01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:40.750
Well I am not sure about that.

890
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:42.326
They are so wild and aggressive.

891
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:43.810
It's not easy.

892
01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:46.200
And not to mention the cost of management.

893
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:49.620
We will pay for it.

894
01:52:56.610 --> 01:53:03.000
Our work is inherently dangerous.

895
01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:22.320
They are animals which can't even talk.

896
01:53:23.610 --> 01:53:24.660
Please understand.

897
01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:34.580
Please.
