1
00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.885
Go, go, go, go.

2
00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.541
<i>We have a code.</i>

3
00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.861
What the fuck.

4
00:02:46.134 --> 00:02:47.167
<i>Who's that?</i>

5
00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:51.405
<i>Drop him!</i>

6
00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:51.699
<i>Tell him about the end times.</i>

7
00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.801
<i>The war will ascend.</i>

8
00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:06.981
How about we start with you
telling me your name.

9
00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.252
John.

10
00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.956
John what?

11
00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.323
Doe.

12
00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:24.632
You think this is a game?

13
00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:29.469
That's what you can call me.

14
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:39.914
Look, I'm your friend.
I'm here to help.

15
00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:44.252
We found you in that building
surrounded by 18 dead bodies.

16
00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:48.488
No one else in sight.
So we need some answers.

17
00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:53.060
And hey, maybe you didn't do it.

18
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:55.196
I'm here to help you.

19
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.665
But you have to
give me the truth...

20
00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:05.673
unless you have
something to confess.

21
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.511
God is always listening.

22
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:14.148
Can God forgive the devil?

23
00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:17.685
So you did do it?

24
00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.967
I've seen it all, John.

25
00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:36.804
Setting up an insanity plea
doesn't quite work that way.

26
00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:38.105
Now, I'm going to need you
to walk me through

27
00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:40.908
every step of this.

28
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.743
My team reports state
that they found your belongings

29
00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:48.616
in the security room,
so you're a security guard?

30
00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:51.252
Night Watchman.

31
00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:55.523
Fine. We'll start there.

32
00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:57.859
When did your employment begin?

33
00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:02.230
<i>I needed a place to stay</i>

34
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.431
<i>and I heard a radio message.</i>

35
00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:07.434
<i>It said in exchange
for food and shelter,</i>

36
00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.871
<i>they needed a Night Watchman.</i>

37
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.038
Who are you?

38
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.943
My name is An Voaen.

39
00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:24.578
What you doing here?

40
00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:29.250
<i>Night Watchman needed.</i>

41
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.751
<i>Food and shelter for work.</i>

42
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:33.554
<i>Location:
hospital.</i>

43
00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:35.856
That's me.

44
00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:38.259
I didn't think
anyone would come.

45
00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:40.294
Most of the people
that come here,

46
00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:42.296
they've lost hope in life.

47
00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:45.299
Job still available?

48
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:46.767
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

49
00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:48.536
You'll do just fine.

50
00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:51.706
Welcome.
Come on. Let's go.

51
00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:54.175
Yeah.

52
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:03.483
You got a good privacy here.

53
00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:06.087
Everybody else
on the fourth floor.

54
00:08:06.187 --> 00:08:07.121
Come on.

55
00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:14.295
It's okay.

56
00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:16.864
Your own place.
I'll show you.

57
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.201
Ey-ya!

58
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.537
Dewitt. Huh.
What are you doing there?

59
00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:27.475
Usual. Watching over Mom.

60
00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:29.543
This is Dewitt.

61
00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:32.580
Her mom, many years ago,
went crazy.

62
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.549
Like way crazy.

63
00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:37.218
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Move, move, move.

64
00:08:39.487 --> 00:08:41.355
This is An's room now.

65
00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.959
So you're the new
Night Watchman?

66
00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:46.761
Yeah.

67
00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:48.729
You cannot leave
your stuff here.

68
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.999
I'll meet you at the canteen.
We'll get you some food.

69
00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:08.049
So...
you ever fought before?

70
00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:15.156
I will fight if I have to.

71
00:09:15.256 --> 00:09:20.061
Well, when you have to fight,
are you any good?

72
00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:29.103
Help!

73
00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:52.126
Aaaahhh!

74
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.469
<i>I used to
fight but I lost control.</i>

75
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.771
<i>I had to learn to
keep it all inside.</i>

76
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:43.010
<i>Fighting only causes pain.</i>

77
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.615
<i>A Night
Watchman too afraid to fight.</i>

78
00:10:46.714 --> 00:10:49.283
<i>Now I've seen everything.</i>

79
00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:17.278
Are you the new Night Watchman?

80
00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:18.445
Yeah.

81
00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:21.048
This is the bad time
of the month.

82
00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:25.119
The 15th day,
the seventh month onwards,

83
00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:29.658
the month of
the Fantasma Briento.

84
00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:32.259
I'm sorry?

85
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:35.162
The hungry ghosts.

86
00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:37.532
Ghosts?

87
00:11:37.632 --> 00:11:39.601
Don't tell me
I'm looking for ghosts.

88
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.837
It's not ghosts we're afraid of.

89
00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:49.443
I'm Janett.
This is my son, Ben is on.

90
00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:52.813
Hi, Janett. Ben is on.

91
00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:53.847
Thank you for being here.

92
00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:56.917
We truly are grateful.

93
00:11:57.017 --> 00:12:01.422
Especially at night,
when they come.

94
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.336
<i>Food rations are
now available at the canteen.</i>

95
00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:17.706
♪ New guy new guy ♪

96
00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:20.074
Oye! Zip it!

97
00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:22.343
<i>Only one ticket per person.</i>

98
00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:24.211
Not so fast.

99
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.213
Here. Take this.

100
00:12:26.313 --> 00:12:28.749
This is how we organize
our rations.

101
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:32.052
You know, food.

102
00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:41.563
Take a seat.

103
00:12:41.663 --> 00:12:43.897
I'll get you your meal
in a moment.

104
00:12:43.998 --> 00:12:46.467
Hey, new Night Watchman.

105
00:12:56.377 --> 00:13:00.749
You know, I... I wish
we had some money for you.

106
00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:03.117
No, I'm just grateful
for the meal.

107
00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:04.952
- I can't afford a meal.
- Yeah.

108
00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:07.788
You haven't tried
the cooking yet.

109
00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:11.158
Just kidding.

110
00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:15.029
Ah, she's a pretty good cook.
At least your job will be easy.

111
00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:18.165
I mean, nobody comes
around here anymore.

112
00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:21.736
Not since what happened
with the, yeah, well, you know.

113
00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.437
What happened?

114
00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:25.939
Eh, children
went missing in the night.

115
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.409
Then end times prophesizes
when children go missing,

116
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.145
evil grows stronger.

117
00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:35.015
It might happen again,
but that's why you're here...

118
00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:38.986
To protect us.
In case this gets worse.

119
00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:40.755
Child went missing?

120
00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.956
You know, ghosts come at night.

121
00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:46.160
Kids are sleeping,
nice and quiet.

122
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.529
Ghosts come in?

123
00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:52.232
Oh. Gho...
Did I say ghosts?

124
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:54.134
I mean, one second,
a child is there

125
00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:56.837
and the next second, poof, gone.

126
00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:58.305
Where did it come from?

127
00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:02.376
Hm. That's a good question.

128
00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:03.977
Yeah.

129
00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:08.382
Hah.

130
00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:12.119
It wards off the evil...
Ghosts, demons, and worse.

131
00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:14.756
There he goes again
with that voodoo shit.

132
00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:17.826
It's not voodoo.
And it's not shit!

133
00:14:17.925 --> 00:14:21.696
That's Hanuman.
He's the Monkey King.

134
00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:23.397
Very strong.

135
00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:26.634
He gives them to everyone
who comes here.

136
00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:28.737
Nobody wears that.

137
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:34.441
Yeah. You hang on to that.
Keep it in your pocket.

138
00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:41.048
That's Janett and Ben is on.

139
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.686
I met them earlier.

140
00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:45.953
Yeah.

141
00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:50.625
She's still freaked out
about that kid missing.

142
00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:56.263
Holds her son's hand so tight,
gonna squeeze it off. Hm.

143
00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:03.270
Hey, she like you.
She looking at you.

144
00:15:05.607 --> 00:15:07.107
But, mm...

145
00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:10.411
You don't wanna get involved
with a single mom, right?

146
00:15:13.848 --> 00:15:15.416
All right, see the little
blonde boy?

147
00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:19.888
That's Dylan.
Best friends with Ben is on.

148
00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:23.357
Too bad
those two have to grow up

149
00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:26.828
in this crazy world.

150
00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:33.133
These ghosts...
where do they come from?

151
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:36.970
I don't know.
I've never seen them before.

152
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.807
It just happened so fast.

153
00:15:38.907 --> 00:15:40.742
What are they
doing with the kids?

154
00:15:40.842 --> 00:15:41.975
Who knows?

155
00:15:42.075 --> 00:15:48.716
Forced marriage,
crime, labor, sex.

156
00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:53.922
Did I say sex?
Ay-ya, eeh.

157
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:57.291
Get that out of my head.
I'm sorry.

158
00:15:57.391 --> 00:16:01.729
Here. Eat your food.
Come on. You must be hungry.

159
00:16:07.669 --> 00:16:08.636
Where's the beef?

160
00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.474
<i>That
night, while doing my rounds,</i>

161
00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:17.077
<i>I realized the people here,
the mother Janett,</i>

162
00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:21.415
<i>the old man Boon-Nam,
they were all keeping secrets.</i>

163
00:16:25.854 --> 00:16:27.287
<i>Curfew is in effect.</i>

164
00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:29.056
<i>All lights will be shut off</i>

165
00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:31.225
<i>ten minutes.</i>

166
00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.060
<i>Please return to your quarters.</i>

167
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.750
<i>Evil lairs.</i>

168
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.485
<i>Evil inside these walls.</i>

169
00:17:13.467 --> 00:17:17.739
<i>The end times draw near.</i>

170
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.407
<i>I can see your past.</i>

171
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.517
Hey, pal.

172
00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:35.557
You were supposed to set up
a peace treaty with me

173
00:17:35.657 --> 00:17:39.527
and the leader
of the Eighth Street Gang.

174
00:17:39.627 --> 00:17:41.696
What the hell happened?

175
00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:45.065
They threw the first punch.

176
00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:51.739
Well... I sent you there
because you could fight,

177
00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:54.274
but it ended up costing me.

178
00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:57.779
Now, if they're to consider
a peace treaty,

179
00:17:57.879 --> 00:17:59.112
they want your head.

180
00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:05.185
Nothing personal.
It's just business.

181
00:18:35.817 --> 00:18:37.317
Yah.

182
00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:45.125
Aaahhhhh!

183
00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:05.506
Ah, sheesh.

184
00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:11.411
You're just getting used
to things.

185
00:20:11.512 --> 00:20:14.281
You're just getting used
to things.

186
00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:17.250
You're just getting used
to things.

187
00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.497
There's a child missing.

188
00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:32.365
No knows if
it's ghosts or demons.

189
00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:37.270
Not like you and me.
Ugh, dumb-ass.

190
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.372
Why are the cops here?

191
00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:41.109
They don't care
what happens here.

192
00:20:41.209 --> 00:20:42.944
Nobody cares.

193
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.082
This happened last night?

194
00:20:48.182 --> 00:20:52.153
Yeah. Don't worry.
Nobody blames you.

195
00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:55.288
They're just worried
about the kids.

196
00:20:58.126 --> 00:21:00.862
What's that smell?

197
00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:02.830
Oh, sorry.

198
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.397
No, it's not that.

199
00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:10.337
Please find my baby.

200
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:13.306
I don't know what to do.
Nothing.

201
00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:19.547
Was it Dylan?

202
00:21:19.647 --> 00:21:22.884
I don't know.

203
00:21:22.984 --> 00:21:26.587
I have to go find Dylan.

204
00:21:26.687 --> 00:21:30.825
I'm afraid it's him this time.

205
00:21:30.925 --> 00:21:36.396
Ben is on? Ben is on.

206
00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:38.566
I told you to
never leave my side.

207
00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:41.936
I was just looking for Dylan.

208
00:21:43.604 --> 00:21:45.973
That's not Dylan's mom.

209
00:21:46.073 --> 00:21:48.075
I think he's okay.

210
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.948
How did I not see them?

211
00:21:54.048 --> 00:21:56.316
Don't blame yourself.

212
00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:59.053
When you have time,
come by the apartment.

213
00:21:59.153 --> 00:22:02.123
We have something for you.

214
00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:05.626
Okay.

215
00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:08.062
That smell keeps
giving me a headache.

216
00:22:27.982 --> 00:22:29.283
Hey.

217
00:22:36.624 --> 00:22:38.059
Did you want something?

218
00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:39.459
Yeah. Um...

219
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.798
I noticed when you came in
that you only had one bag.

220
00:22:43.898 --> 00:22:45.733
That's all I have.

221
00:22:45.833 --> 00:22:48.836
Here.

222
00:22:48.936 --> 00:22:50.437
What is that?

223
00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:53.774
I told you before.
Fantasma Briento.

224
00:22:53.875 --> 00:22:56.577
Oh, right.
Hungry Ghosts Month?

225
00:22:56.677 --> 00:22:59.247
I saw some other people
put them out.

226
00:22:59.347 --> 00:23:01.649
Boon-Nam says that's your thing.

227
00:23:01.749 --> 00:23:03.317
We leave offerings for the dead,

228
00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:05.452
hoping that the spirits
of those who died here

229
00:23:05.553 --> 00:23:07.655
will take care of our children.

230
00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:11.225
Surprised more people
believe in that stuff.

231
00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:14.762
You're wearing
Boon-Nam's amulet.

232
00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:18.199
He chooses to pray to gods
for protection

233
00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:20.601
and I choose to give hope
instead.

234
00:23:26.707 --> 00:23:28.910
I don't believe in this stuff.

235
00:23:50.231 --> 00:23:51.933
Where's his father now?

236
00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:01.943
Met someone younger. Left and
never looked back.

237
00:24:02.043 --> 00:24:06.047
So did they hire you
because you can fight?

238
00:24:06.147 --> 00:24:08.115
Aahhh!

239
00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:09.684
That's what they're counting on.

240
00:24:09.784 --> 00:24:11.719
Have you ever been
a Night Watchman?

241
00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:13.554
No.

242
00:24:13.654 --> 00:24:15.790
I guess we'll take
what we can get, huh?

243
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.892
They're frightened
and desperate.

244
00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:22.596
Any idea who's behind all this?

245
00:24:22.697 --> 00:24:26.499
No. But I heard a name.

246
00:24:30.838 --> 00:24:32.940
Mephisto.

247
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.143
Say that again.

248
00:24:36.243 --> 00:24:40.214
Mephisto.

249
00:24:40.314 --> 00:24:41.782
What else did you hear?

250
00:24:41.882 --> 00:24:43.884
I heard about the Four Horsemen,

251
00:24:43.985 --> 00:24:46.220
how they plan to use
the souls of children

252
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.659
to bring about the end times.

253
00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:54.328
Mephisto kidnaps children.

254
00:24:54.428 --> 00:24:57.398
That's how the evil
grows more powerful.

255
00:24:57.497 --> 00:24:59.800
Once the evil is strong enough,

256
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.705
they will have a ceremony
and it will end everything.

257
00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:09.543
Well, that's not what
my team has determined.

258
00:25:09.643 --> 00:25:13.381
Half your team is dead
because of the evil.

259
00:25:13.481 --> 00:25:15.683
In order to stop the apocalypse,

260
00:25:15.783 --> 00:25:18.686
one has to kill
all of the Four Horsemen.

261
00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:25.993
The thing is, the Four Horsemen
look the same as everyone else.

262
00:25:26.093 --> 00:25:30.297
They look like me.
They look like you.

263
00:25:30.398 --> 00:25:31.632
Let's be clear.

264
00:25:31.732 --> 00:25:35.236
Half my team is dead
because of you.

265
00:25:35.336 --> 00:25:37.738
But let's get back
to your story.

266
00:25:41.042 --> 00:25:45.813
You say you saw
the Four Horsemen.

267
00:25:45.913 --> 00:25:47.815
Some thought they were ghosts.

268
00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:51.452
Some thought they were demons.
I knew the truth.

269
00:25:51.552 --> 00:25:54.922
I start killing them,
one by one.

270
00:26:12.807 --> 00:26:15.376
<i>You're on
the right track, Night Watchman.</i>

271
00:26:15.476 --> 00:26:19.080
<i>The evil grows strong
underground.</i>

272
00:28:07.154 --> 00:28:10.457
<i>You can feel the evil inside.</i>

273
00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:13.460
<i>It calls your name.</i>

274
00:28:34.915 --> 00:28:37.384
Hey! Drop the kid!

275
00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:40.387
Get him.

276
00:30:05.172 --> 00:30:11.178
Bring the child.
The Babylon of perfection.

277
00:30:11.278 --> 00:30:15.583
Their innocence is my hunger.

278
00:30:15.684 --> 00:30:18.753
I need more children.
Only need.

279
00:30:18.852 --> 00:30:20.588
Not we need.

280
00:30:20.689 --> 00:30:27.094
Just one more child
for each of us.

281
00:30:28.929 --> 00:30:33.033
Our communion will be
complete with these children.

282
00:30:33.133 --> 00:30:36.604
As Horsemen,
we will ride a wave of blood

283
00:30:36.705 --> 00:30:41.108
that ushers in the apocalypse.

284
00:30:41.208 --> 00:30:48.717
All we need
is two more children.

285
00:30:48.817 --> 00:30:52.086
It is much too soon, Samael.

286
00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:56.758
It is not your job to tell us
when or how we do things.

287
00:30:56.857 --> 00:31:00.160
It is never too soon
to feed off the young.

288
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.895
Let's get ready.

289
00:31:01.995 --> 00:31:05.999
And soon,
we will be unstoppable.

290
00:31:09.002 --> 00:31:10.471
<i>An?</i>

291
00:31:12.674 --> 00:31:13.808
He's still breathing.

292
00:31:13.907 --> 00:31:17.378
Come on. He's losing
too much blood.

293
00:31:17.478 --> 00:31:19.848
What are we gonna do?
He's gonna die.

294
00:31:19.947 --> 00:31:21.949
That's okay, don't worry.

295
00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:23.317
He's not gonna make it.

296
00:31:23.417 --> 00:31:28.088
I'm trying, okay?
I have no choice.

297
00:31:33.894 --> 00:31:35.028
I need you to pay attention.

298
00:31:35.129 --> 00:31:37.965
We're gonna lose him.
Do anything.

299
00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:57.685
Drink something.
Please.

300
00:31:57.786 --> 00:32:01.054
Nothing. Nothing.

301
00:32:03.758 --> 00:32:07.494
Is there anything else
we can do?

302
00:32:07.595 --> 00:32:09.697
Yeah. Keep praying.

303
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:19.273
An-an, you can do this.
I believe in you.

304
00:32:19.373 --> 00:32:22.544
<i>Death is not the end.</i>

305
00:32:22.644 --> 00:32:25.212
<i>There is still another way.</i>

306
00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:36.925
<i>Make sure he is cleaned properly</i>

307
00:32:37.024 --> 00:32:39.493
<i>with water from
the blessed sacrament.</i>

308
00:32:39.594 --> 00:32:41.962
<i>There is a chance we can
bring him back from the dead</i>

309
00:32:42.062 --> 00:32:44.699
<i>if we are lucky.</i>

310
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:11.753
<i>Death is calling.</i>

311
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:21.395
<i>But yet you summoned me.</i>

312
00:34:27.802 --> 00:34:31.706
<i>Don't you know there are things
worse than death?</i>

313
00:34:38.513 --> 00:34:41.015
<i>You of pain.</i>

314
00:34:41.114 --> 00:34:45.720
<i>You come to my world
seeking life.</i>

315
00:34:53.528 --> 00:34:57.532
One foot in hell
and another on Earth.

316
00:34:57.632 --> 00:34:59.567
<i>But you are still here</i>

317
00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:03.337
<i>where death is
but inches from you.</i>

318
00:35:12.379 --> 00:35:15.817
<i>Will they know who I am?</i>

319
00:35:15.917 --> 00:35:18.218
<i>I'm Hanuman.</i>

320
00:35:18.318 --> 00:35:21.856
<i>In the end times,
I will give you</i>

321
00:35:21.956 --> 00:35:24.391
<i>a second chance on earth.</i>

322
00:35:33.101 --> 00:35:35.903
<i>Do as I say.</i>

323
00:35:36.004 --> 00:35:38.706
<i>Return to the land
of the living.</i>

324
00:35:38.806 --> 00:35:44.846
<i>I will summon you
when the time comes.</i>

325
00:36:04.464 --> 00:36:07.035
I got you.
I got you.

326
00:36:10.104 --> 00:36:11.271
Where is Janett?

327
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:13.306
She's upstairs with Ben is on,
giving him a bath.

328
00:36:13.407 --> 00:36:15.275
I need to thank her.

329
00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:19.413
Hey. You'll be okay.
I got you. I got you.

330
00:36:19.514 --> 00:36:22.182
When did you get up?
Do you need something to eat?

331
00:36:22.282 --> 00:36:24.652
My head hurts really bad.

332
00:36:24.752 --> 00:36:26.854
You have a fever.
Your body is healing.

333
00:36:26.954 --> 00:36:28.523
It's okay.

334
00:36:28.623 --> 00:36:30.725
I've been seeing some things.

335
00:36:30.825 --> 00:36:32.927
I... I... shh.

336
00:36:33.027 --> 00:36:35.429
Not... not here.
Not in public.

337
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.031
Did you do something to me?

338
00:36:37.131 --> 00:36:40.068
Shh. Not here.
Okay. I got you. Come on.

339
00:36:40.168 --> 00:36:41.703
Let's take you somewhere else.

340
00:36:54.749 --> 00:36:55.650
Quite a collection.

341
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.986
Yes.
This is my family's legacy.

342
00:37:03.825 --> 00:37:08.228
You know, when I was in the
hospital with the theta variant,

343
00:37:08.328 --> 00:37:12.934
my mom, she would
tell me stories.

344
00:37:13.034 --> 00:37:14.736
The hospital closed,

345
00:37:14.836 --> 00:37:18.371
and I spent three years
trying to find them.

346
00:37:18.472 --> 00:37:22.076
Trying to figure out why
they never came back for me.

347
00:37:22.176 --> 00:37:27.582
I found out they were dead.

348
00:37:27.682 --> 00:37:32.352
You never lived
in a regular house?

349
00:37:32.452 --> 00:37:34.454
No, I was just 16.

350
00:37:34.555 --> 00:37:36.824
Deeds were turned back
to the government.

351
00:37:36.924 --> 00:37:38.893
I salvaged what I could,
brought it back here,

352
00:37:38.993 --> 00:37:41.294
and made this my home.

353
00:37:44.999 --> 00:37:47.300
You believe in all this?

354
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.669
I mean, it's about
protection and all,

355
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:53.875
but sometimes I wonder,
what is it protecting us from?

356
00:37:53.975 --> 00:37:55.977
Maybe even ourselves.

357
00:38:23.237 --> 00:38:24.639
I want out.

358
00:38:27.675 --> 00:38:31.311
And where are you gonna go?

359
00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:33.815
Rival gang's looking for you.

360
00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:42.355
Police. Hm?

361
00:38:42.455 --> 00:38:47.028
In fact, I think
I'll be doing you a favor.

362
00:38:47.128 --> 00:38:49.462
Bringing them your head now.

363
00:38:49.564 --> 00:38:51.599
This ends tonight.

364
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.839
Get rid of him.

365
00:38:57.939 --> 00:39:00.041
Haah!

366
00:41:26.387 --> 00:41:29.023
You okay?

367
00:41:29.123 --> 00:41:31.926
You got a ritual
to make me stop hallucinating?

368
00:41:32.026 --> 00:41:34.228
That's what I need.

369
00:41:34.328 --> 00:41:36.897
Remember, Hanuman needs a host.

370
00:41:36.998 --> 00:41:41.602
He may try to control you,
but he cannot kill you.

371
00:41:41.702 --> 00:41:43.237
I need to do my rounds.

372
00:41:47.608 --> 00:41:49.443
He's right.

373
00:41:49.543 --> 00:41:51.445
I've seen people
possessed before.

374
00:41:51.545 --> 00:41:54.448
There's always an explanation.

375
00:41:54.548 --> 00:41:57.985
The mind is a powerful thing.

376
00:41:58.085 --> 00:42:02.456
Let's get back to Mephisto
and these Horsemen.

377
00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:07.795
You think that they kidnapped
the children, hm?

378
00:42:07.895 --> 00:42:10.698
Don't you?

379
00:42:10.798 --> 00:42:12.900
You want to know what I think?

380
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.202
I think this is all bullshit
you made up

381
00:42:15.302 --> 00:42:18.472
because you failed
to do your job.

382
00:42:18.572 --> 00:42:20.374
I came here
because I intend to save

383
00:42:20.474 --> 00:42:22.610
the stolen children.

384
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:26.380
You came here
because you were arrested.

385
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.617
You see, those children...

386
00:42:29.717 --> 00:42:32.521
I'm going to prove
that you took them.

387
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:37.158
What if the truth
is more than that?

388
00:42:47.501 --> 00:42:52.973
Mister An?
What are you doing?

389
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:56.977
I locked the door,

390
00:42:57.078 --> 00:43:01.048
making sure
no one gets in or out.

391
00:43:01.148 --> 00:43:03.851
What are you doing here?
Where's your mom?

392
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:09.290
She's waiting for some supper
from Auntie Charlotte.

393
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:13.461
I told her
I'm gonna talk to you.

394
00:43:13.562 --> 00:43:17.532
Sure.
What you got on your mind?

395
00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:22.269
Where is Dylan?
Are you going to find him?

396
00:43:22.369 --> 00:43:25.706
I miss him.

397
00:43:25.806 --> 00:43:27.341
I'm gonna find him.

398
00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:36.750
I think you can protect us all.

399
00:43:36.851 --> 00:43:40.187
I can barely protect myself.

400
00:43:40.287 --> 00:43:43.858
But you look strong.

401
00:43:46.293 --> 00:43:52.601
This body can take
a beating. I admit that.

402
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:58.472
Mister An, are you okay?

403
00:43:58.573 --> 00:44:05.079
Yeah. Adults,
you know, we think too much.

404
00:44:05.179 --> 00:44:06.647
You're a good man.

405
00:44:11.318 --> 00:44:13.522
That's a first.

406
00:44:13.622 --> 00:44:17.725
You know, my mom always says

407
00:44:17.825 --> 00:44:23.197
when you see someone,
always close your eyes.

408
00:44:23.297 --> 00:44:29.303
Because you can only know
someone when you feel them.

409
00:44:29.403 --> 00:44:32.306
Try it.

410
00:44:32.406 --> 00:44:33.440
I know.

411
00:44:33.542 --> 00:44:36.477
Try it.

412
00:44:36.578 --> 00:44:37.978
Okay.

413
00:44:38.078 --> 00:44:39.213
Follow me.

414
00:44:45.986 --> 00:44:48.389
<i>Before the boy,</i>

415
00:44:48.489 --> 00:44:52.226
<i>I know what you are.
A killer.</i>

416
00:44:52.326 --> 00:44:55.129
<i>Kill the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse</i>

417
00:44:55.229 --> 00:44:58.299
<i>and anyone
that stands in our way.</i>

418
00:45:03.837 --> 00:45:10.878
See. I can feel
what a good man you are,

419
00:45:10.978 --> 00:45:15.983
and you're going to
protect us all.

420
00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:18.886
<i>The boy is wrong.</i>

421
00:45:22.624 --> 00:45:24.693
<i>Go with them.</i>

422
00:45:24.792 --> 00:45:28.530
Pinky promise?

423
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:30.699
I promise.

424
00:45:30.798 --> 00:45:32.233
<i>Ben is on.</i>

425
00:45:37.972 --> 00:45:41.509
You're looking better.
Have you been resting?

426
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.911
I never got a chance
to thank you.

427
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:45.680
- I didn't do anything.
- Yes, you did.

428
00:45:45.779 --> 00:45:49.584
You took care of me
when I needed it most.

429
00:45:49.684 --> 00:45:51.318
You saved me.

430
00:45:56.757 --> 00:45:58.392
<i>We'll kill her too,</i>

431
00:45:58.492 --> 00:46:01.295
<i>if she tries to stop us.</i>

432
00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:03.063
Stay in your rooms tonight.

433
00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:13.742
<i>I can see what you are.</i>

434
00:46:20.047 --> 00:46:23.317
<i>Tonight will still proceed.</i>

435
00:46:31.626 --> 00:46:34.663
<i>You can smell it, can't you?</i>

436
00:46:34.763 --> 00:46:39.166
<i>The hunger.
Go and hide yourself. Go.</i>

437
00:48:00.247 --> 00:48:01.315
Hey!

438
00:48:05.953 --> 00:48:08.690
Ben is on! Drop the kid.

439
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.892
Aaaaahhhhhhh!

440
00:48:25.339 --> 00:48:31.478
<i>Get up.</i>

441
00:48:35.249 --> 00:48:38.586
I will not deny
the power of the body.

442
00:48:42.456 --> 00:48:44.958
Rise and destroy them.

443
00:48:48.996 --> 00:48:51.198
You ain't getting up
from that one.

444
00:48:53.768 --> 00:48:55.436
It's finished.

445
00:49:09.082 --> 00:49:11.385
We had a deal.

446
00:49:11.485 --> 00:49:15.723
<i>You give me blood,
I give you life.</i>

447
00:49:25.466 --> 00:49:27.000
What the hell?

448
00:49:29.102 --> 00:49:31.071
<i>Tear their flesh.</i>

449
00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:33.440
<i>Rip their souls.</i>

450
00:50:01.502 --> 00:50:03.571
Give me the boy.

451
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:05.507
Give me the boy!

452
00:50:34.234 --> 00:50:38.773
<i>Until I know.</i>

453
00:50:52.921 --> 00:50:55.790
Let me get this straight.

454
00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:57.759
You made a deal with the devil,

455
00:50:57.859 --> 00:51:02.597
and it's consuming your soul
every time you fight.

456
00:51:02.697 --> 00:51:05.600
Death God.

457
00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:09.169
Right. Death God.

458
00:51:09.269 --> 00:51:11.606
So it just came right out
and made a deal with you.

459
00:51:11.706 --> 00:51:13.273
Like that?

460
00:51:13.373 --> 00:51:15.977
Must have been
something Boon-Nam did

461
00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:18.780
when I was
on the brink of death.

462
00:51:21.616 --> 00:51:24.552
A curse?

463
00:51:24.652 --> 00:51:29.189
Depends on what you think of
as a curse.

464
00:51:29.289 --> 00:51:31.458
Some may want this curse.

465
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:39.834
Well, it's kept you alive
this far.

466
00:51:39.934 --> 00:51:42.003
Barely.

467
00:51:42.102 --> 00:51:44.304
Can't say much
for the rest of them.

468
00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:48.175
What happened next?

469
00:51:49.877 --> 00:51:54.649
Ben is on!

470
00:51:54.749 --> 00:51:55.617
What the hell?

471
00:51:55.717 --> 00:51:59.954
They took Ben is on.
My baby. Ben is on!

472
00:52:00.054 --> 00:52:03.524
Ben is on. They took him.
They took him.

473
00:52:03.625 --> 00:52:04.859
Keep still.

474
00:52:04.959 --> 00:52:05.994
Where's An?

475
00:52:06.094 --> 00:52:09.731
They took him.
They took Ben is on.

476
00:52:21.643 --> 00:52:24.912
<i>For each soul you take,</i>

477
00:52:25.013 --> 00:52:28.248
<i>each time you spill blood,</i>

478
00:52:28.348 --> 00:52:33.821
<i>a little more of your soul
belongs to me.</i>

479
00:52:49.637 --> 00:52:53.206
The child we
brought back is awake, Mephisto.

480
00:52:53.306 --> 00:52:56.010
Immunity builds quick.

481
00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.312
We should have enough
to get the last one.

482
00:52:59.413 --> 00:53:01.749
You join him with the rest.

483
00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.132
Be comfortable, my children.

484
00:53:18.231 --> 00:53:22.103
Patience, 'cause
there's only one more.

485
00:53:22.202 --> 00:53:25.139
We should begin
the ritual, Mephisto.

486
00:53:25.238 --> 00:53:29.544
Not until we have
the last child.

487
00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.235
<i>Here they come.</i>

488
00:53:55.335 --> 00:53:57.004
<i>Now is your chance.</i>

489
00:54:05.278 --> 00:54:08.216
Which one should we get
this time?

490
00:54:08.315 --> 00:54:10.685
Doesn't matter.
Whatever we find next.

491
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.223
Tell me where the kids are!

492
00:54:52.593 --> 00:54:55.163
<i>Another dead body.</i>

493
00:55:04.005 --> 00:55:06.908
<i>Can you feel our powers</i>

494
00:55:07.008 --> 00:55:09.944
<i>growing stronger?</i>

495
00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:27.895
More blood.

496
00:55:37.572 --> 00:55:41.474
More vengeance for your soul.

497
00:55:46.147 --> 00:55:48.716
A metamorphosis, you say?

498
00:55:48.816 --> 00:55:50.551
Shapeshifting perhaps.

499
00:55:50.651 --> 00:55:52.220
He was turning into something.

500
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.621
Turning?

501
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:57.490
How has the Night
Watchman grown so strong?

502
00:55:57.592 --> 00:56:00.895
This man is the work
of the devil himself.

503
00:56:00.995 --> 00:56:02.163
How about is it done?

504
00:56:02.263 --> 00:56:05.465
A demon inside his body.

505
00:56:05.566 --> 00:56:09.402
, especially the old man.

506
00:56:09.502 --> 00:56:11.706
I think he answers
to some kind of Death God.

507
00:56:11.806 --> 00:56:15.743
If it's human,
we can still kill it.

508
00:56:15.843 --> 00:56:18.112
There is no other god.

509
00:56:18.212 --> 00:56:21.883
Kill the body
and the demon dies with it.

510
00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:26.754
<i>There is no time.</i>

511
00:56:26.854 --> 00:56:29.422
<i>The demon's fusing itself
to the man's body.</i>

512
00:56:29.523 --> 00:56:30.791
<i>If too much time passes,</i>

513
00:56:30.892 --> 00:56:32.960
<i>Hanuman manifests
its physical form</i>

514
00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.528
<i>through his flesh.</i>

515
00:56:38.032 --> 00:56:40.968
If he is trying
to kill the Four Horsemen

516
00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:42.837
to stop the Apocalypse,

517
00:56:42.937 --> 00:56:47.508
then our aim is to kill
the Night Watchman.

518
00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:49.343
We have enough
children to start the ritual

519
00:56:49.442 --> 00:56:52.479
for our essentials.
Let us begin.

520
00:56:53.648 --> 00:56:55.683
So, they came
for you this time, huh?

521
00:56:55.783 --> 00:56:59.153
Why do you want to call it now?
Self-defense?

522
00:56:59.253 --> 00:57:02.290
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

523
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:05.092
Then give me a confession.

524
00:57:08.663 --> 00:57:10.598
This is the confession.

525
00:57:12.499 --> 00:57:17.004
The story. The journey...

526
00:57:17.104 --> 00:57:19.040
<i>Detective.</i>

527
00:57:32.153 --> 00:57:33.486
An.

528
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.273
Is that where the children are?

529
00:57:52.373 --> 00:57:55.576
The evil is behind the door.

530
00:57:55.676 --> 00:57:59.513
The children won't be alive
much longer.

531
00:57:59.613 --> 00:58:01.882
And the only way to end this

532
00:58:04.652 --> 00:58:09.156
is to give up what's left
of my soul to Hanuman.

533
00:58:09.256 --> 00:58:14.261
I might have to lure them out.
It's gonna be very dangerous.

534
00:58:14.362 --> 00:58:18.232
The kids are living
on borrowed time.

535
00:58:18.332 --> 00:58:20.101
What can we do to help?

536
00:58:20.201 --> 00:58:22.636
I could save the children.

537
00:58:22.737 --> 00:58:27.675
<i>But you're gonna have to do
exactly as I say.</i>

538
00:58:27.775 --> 00:58:30.745
<i>Gather the others,
wall yourselves in.</i>

539
00:58:30.845 --> 00:58:34.849
<i>Don't answer to anyone
including me.</i>

540
00:58:34.949 --> 00:58:39.587
<i>No matter what happens,
stay inside.</i>

541
00:58:39.687 --> 00:58:42.823
<i>You could pray to whatever god
you believe in,</i>

542
00:58:42.923 --> 00:58:49.830
<i>but tonight only one
will answer: Death.</i>

543
00:59:00.541 --> 00:59:03.411
Let this be God.

544
00:59:05.179 --> 00:59:07.448
He turned it off.

545
00:59:07.548 --> 00:59:09.116
He's luring us.

546
00:59:09.216 --> 00:59:12.887
Take him out!

547
00:59:17.258 --> 00:59:21.395
No. I got him this time.

548
00:59:39.046 --> 00:59:40.014
Control the exit.

549
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:57.064
Let me see.

550
01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:09.076
Hanuman.
The glory of Rama.

551
01:00:09.176 --> 01:00:12.646
God of fighting.

552
01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:15.783
King of fighting, huh?

553
01:00:15.883 --> 01:00:17.785
Well, let's see what it can do.

554
01:01:03.464 --> 01:01:04.698
Something's wrong.

555
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.315
We have to help him.

556
01:01:21.415 --> 01:01:22.416
You said
he wants us to stay here,

557
01:01:22.517 --> 01:01:23.784
no matter what happens.

558
01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:25.554
Something is wrong.

559
01:01:31.859 --> 01:01:34.995
So? Are you gonna help or what?

560
01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:43.170
You fight with no conviction.

561
01:01:47.308 --> 01:01:49.644
This is how you die.

562
01:02:00.754 --> 01:02:02.456
Let him go.

563
01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:09.897
Look at this bitch.

564
01:02:09.997 --> 01:02:12.466
Always have someone
helping you, huh?

565
01:02:22.476 --> 01:02:24.878
Sure you know how to use that?

566
01:02:24.979 --> 01:02:26.780
We fight in numbers.

567
01:02:28.816 --> 01:02:32.419
I'll be back with more.

568
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.856
It's over.
Where's Ben is on?

569
01:02:35.956 --> 01:02:38.092
I ain't tellin' you shit.

570
01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:39.360
Get him!

571
01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:48.670
No! No!

572
01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:51.606
No, no, no. Stop! Stop!
Don't go there.

573
01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:53.007
I'm gonna kill you.

574
01:02:53.107 --> 01:02:55.476
You can't hide forever,
motherfucker!

575
01:02:55.577 --> 01:02:58.613
Let me go.
No. I wanna get my son.

576
01:02:58.713 --> 01:03:01.415
Okay, okay.
We'll come another time.

577
01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:03.050
Fuck!

578
01:03:06.787 --> 01:03:07.689
<i>You are not done</i>

579
01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:11.058
<i>with the slaughter yet.</i>

580
01:03:16.163 --> 01:03:17.431
<i>Isn't gonna</i>

581
01:03:17.532 --> 01:03:19.601
<i>escape from our deal.</i>

582
01:03:24.506 --> 01:03:26.273
That's how it works

583
01:03:26.373 --> 01:03:30.712
despite your first guide.

584
01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:33.213
That's not why I killed myself.

585
01:03:33.314 --> 01:03:37.918
Thoughts went through your head.

586
01:03:38.018 --> 01:03:40.287
I needed to find a way...

587
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:44.858
to my darkness.

588
01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:47.895
Palace of the Death God.

589
01:03:47.995 --> 01:03:51.865
Soul.

590
01:03:51.965 --> 01:03:57.271
A deal was done
without my assent.

591
01:03:57.371 --> 01:04:04.111
What if I give it to you
fully... right now?

592
01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:09.216
There is no going back
once you take out my full power.

593
01:04:09.316 --> 01:04:10.518
Mm-hm.

594
01:04:12.687 --> 01:04:17.991
Your body and soul
will be mine for eternity.

595
01:04:18.092 --> 01:04:21.495
And I will be rewarding the.

596
01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:25.132
Do it! Do it.

597
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:31.872
So be it.
You got the staff of Hanuman.

598
01:04:31.972 --> 01:04:33.907
Become the darkness.

599
01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:40.615
<i>Return to your world
one last time.</i>

600
01:04:40.715 --> 01:04:43.685
<i>Show them.</i>

601
01:04:43.785 --> 01:04:47.321
<i>Your body and soul.</i>

602
01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:49.858
<i>Unlimited powers...</i>

603
01:04:56.664 --> 01:05:01.636
<i>and your body will become mine.</i>

604
01:05:07.107 --> 01:05:15.107
<i>My power every soul.</i>

605
01:05:18.185 --> 01:05:19.687
Fuck.

606
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:25.426
He had some help.

607
01:05:25.527 --> 01:05:28.395
The squatters
are beginning to revolt.

608
01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:34.001
They find strength and resolve
in his presence.

609
01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:37.070
I'm gonna fucking
kill them next time.

610
01:05:37.171 --> 01:05:40.775
But you could
do with a little help.

611
01:05:40.875 --> 01:05:43.177
Your goal is to find a weakness

612
01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:46.313
to sever the ties
between this Night Watchman

613
01:05:46.413 --> 01:05:48.949
and his Death God.

614
01:05:49.049 --> 01:05:50.417
What?

615
01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:53.721
Fight Eastern gods
with Eastern magic.

616
01:05:53.822 --> 01:05:57.057
Nam man prai, corpse oil.

617
01:05:57.157 --> 01:06:00.994
That is the weakness of the
spirits who have crossed over.

618
01:06:01.094 --> 01:06:02.697
We need the body
of a pregnant woman

619
01:06:02.797 --> 01:06:05.432
who died a tragic death,

620
01:06:05.533 --> 01:06:08.736
we extract it
by burning the chin

621
01:06:08.837 --> 01:06:12.574
the cursed candle
until the oil forms.

622
01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:19.313
Use this to stop him.

623
01:06:19.413 --> 01:06:25.185
But be warned, it only works
for a short time.

624
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.000
An?

625
01:06:45.272 --> 01:06:47.642
I've been looking
all over for you.

626
01:06:47.742 --> 01:06:49.276
I thought you were dead.

627
01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:59.687
You look different.

628
01:06:59.787 --> 01:07:02.624
I'm gonna get the children back.

629
01:07:02.724 --> 01:07:05.927
I will not fail this time.

630
01:07:06.026 --> 01:07:09.463
We tried chasing him.

631
01:07:09.564 --> 01:07:11.533
They disappeared
behind the door again.

632
01:07:13.701 --> 01:07:15.570
That door.

633
01:07:45.533 --> 01:07:46.634
What did you say?

634
01:07:50.872 --> 01:07:52.006
The legend goes

635
01:07:52.105 --> 01:07:55.977
that if you pray to
the statue of Santa Maria,

636
01:07:56.076 --> 01:07:59.714
she will point you
the right way.

637
01:07:59.814 --> 01:08:04.117
Point?

638
01:08:04.217 --> 01:08:06.754
Give you guidance, you know?

639
01:08:13.093 --> 01:08:16.564
<i>All is not lost.</i>

640
01:08:16.664 --> 01:08:20.267
<i>You can still save them
by redeeming yourself.</i>

641
01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:26.941
An? An?
An, where are you going?

642
01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.241
Just stay here.

643
01:08:40.722 --> 01:08:45.727
Okay, Santa Maria, I'm here.

644
01:08:45.827 --> 01:08:47.327
What are you trying to tell me?

645
01:09:05.379 --> 01:09:08.549
<i>There is no turning back now.</i>

646
01:10:19.921 --> 01:10:21.254
<i>Find the last Horseman</i>

647
01:10:21.354 --> 01:10:22.924
<i>of the Apocalypse</i>.

648
01:11:21.348 --> 01:11:24.451
Aaaaaaahhhhhh!

649
01:11:34.262 --> 01:11:36.164
You're like a fucking rat.

650
01:11:36.264 --> 01:11:40.835
Give me the kids. Go.

651
01:11:40.935 --> 01:11:45.506
I can't do that.
It's time.

652
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:52.814
Take him out, Samael,
and be quick about it.

653
01:11:52.914 --> 01:11:53.915
Aaah!

654
01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.942
Yah!

655
01:12:36.190 --> 01:12:39.293
How's it feel?

656
01:12:39.426 --> 01:12:41.796
Powerless?

657
01:12:41.896 --> 01:12:44.632
Scared?

658
01:12:44.732 --> 01:12:47.400
Fucking weak?

659
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.271
You got nothing now.
Where's your God now?

660
01:14:25.433 --> 01:14:26.867
Hanuman.

661
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.068
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

662
01:16:07.168 --> 01:16:10.037
How does it feel, Death God?

663
01:16:10.137 --> 01:16:11.672
Like the pain?

664
01:16:11.772 --> 01:16:12.940
Fucking powerless?

665
01:16:33.562 --> 01:16:35.763
Yaaahhh!

666
01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:22.476
Mister An.

667
01:17:22.577 --> 01:17:24.345
Stay away from me.

668
01:17:24.445 --> 01:17:29.283
Don't worry.
We're here for you.

669
01:19:07.716 --> 01:19:10.751
A demon, huh?

670
01:19:10.851 --> 01:19:16.991
Great story.
Tragic ending.

671
01:19:17.091 --> 01:19:22.029
So you didn't get Mephisto,
I see.

672
01:19:22.129 --> 01:19:24.932
Not yet anyway,

673
01:19:25.032 --> 01:19:29.837
but he's sitting
right in front of me.

674
01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:32.006
What the hell
are you talking about?

675
01:19:36.645 --> 01:19:39.313
I know it was you.

676
01:19:39.413 --> 01:19:42.783
<i>I remember that smell like
the first time I smelled it.</i>

677
01:19:42.883 --> 01:19:45.486
<i>The smell of evil and death.</i>

678
01:19:45.587 --> 01:19:49.390
<i>The first time I saw you guys,
I didn't think much at first...</i>

679
01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:53.394
<i>until you came.</i>

680
01:19:55.796 --> 01:20:01.135
<i>Your stench, Mephisto,
never lies.</i>

681
01:20:02.236 --> 01:20:05.039
Aaaahh! What the hell
are you talking about?

682
01:20:06.807 --> 01:20:08.842
I let myself get caught.

683
01:20:08.942 --> 01:20:10.277
I had to make sure.

684
01:20:10.377 --> 01:20:11.879
Bullshit!

685
01:20:18.185 --> 01:20:21.288
We meet
without the mask, Mephisto.

686
01:20:21.388 --> 01:20:27.127
You're gonna accuse me
based on smell?

687
01:20:27.227 --> 01:20:31.432
See, the thing about being
the Death God is...

688
01:20:31.533 --> 01:20:33.067
you can see the dead.

689
01:20:36.937 --> 01:20:38.807
Don't kill him.

690
01:20:38.906 --> 01:20:41.543
You can feel little.

691
01:20:41.643 --> 01:20:44.111
An, you have a choice.

692
01:20:44.211 --> 01:20:46.113
Don't kill him.
- You kill me,

693
01:20:46.213 --> 01:20:52.554
everyone in the hospital
will be prosecuted or worse.

694
01:20:52.654 --> 01:20:54.421
Your fault.

695
01:20:54.522 --> 01:20:56.791
'S the bad guy.

696
01:20:56.890 --> 01:21:02.196
Bad, good...
it's a human construct.

697
01:21:02.296 --> 01:21:06.500
I'm just Hanuman
and you're just a man.

698
01:21:28.989 --> 01:21:32.426
I will still ascend.

699
01:21:32.527 --> 01:21:34.829
I'm a Death God.

700
01:21:34.928 --> 01:21:37.064
I will take you there
personally.

701
01:21:46.206 --> 01:21:48.442
<i>You please the Death God.</i>

702
01:21:48.543 --> 01:21:52.647
<i>Now is finally complete.</i>

703
01:21:52.747 --> 01:21:56.250
<i>Has folded.</i>

704
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:59.754
<i>The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse are killed.</i>

705
01:21:59.854 --> 01:22:03.323
<i>Our deal is done.</i>

706
01:22:03.424 --> 01:22:05.993
Thank you.

707
01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:08.061
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

708
01:22:08.162 --> 01:22:09.764
<i>Power,</i>

709
01:22:09.864 --> 01:22:12.366
<i>you wielded the staff.</i>

710
01:22:12.466 --> 01:22:15.603
<i>You spilled the blood.</i>

711
01:22:15.703 --> 01:22:22.042
<i>And now, your body
belongs to me.</i>

712
01:22:22.142 --> 01:22:23.511
I want you to stay.

713
01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:24.679
You can stay with us.

714
01:22:24.779 --> 01:22:27.715
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

715
01:22:27.816 --> 01:22:30.585
Please stay.

716
01:22:30.685 --> 01:22:32.386
You gave us hope.

717
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:56.477
<i>And
the doom world is so divided.</i>

718
01:22:56.578 --> 01:23:00.214
<i>I am Hanuman.</i>

719
01:23:00.314 --> 01:23:05.753
<i>The harbinger
