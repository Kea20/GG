00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:26.227
to the Fox News Channel."

176
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.064
Of course, this follows the
boycott of over 50 advertisers

177
00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:33.367
of <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>
after a <i>New York Times</i> report

178
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.003
of sexual harassment allegations

179
00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:38.739
and the report that
Fox and O'Reilly together

180
00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.741
spent about $13 million

181
00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:44.011
to settle those allegations
from five different women.

182
00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:46.213
-So, the story...
-Job well done, Emily.

183
00:10:46.247 --> 00:10:47.414
Thanks, Dean.

184
00:10:47.448 --> 00:10:49.183
And you, Mike.
Excellent reporting.

185
00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:51.152
BOORSTIN: ...not be returning
to his top-rated cable show.

186
00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:54.288
Are we talking solely
corporate misuse of power?

187
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.956
No, we're talking all workplaces

188
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.893
where sexual harassment
might happen.

189
00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:00.261
Also, let's look
for the enablers.

190
00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:01.762
Fox kept O'Reilly on

191
00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:03.464
for quite some time
after our story broke.

192
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:04.932
And for decades before that.

193
00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:06.300
EMILY:
The network only ousted him

194
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.902
when the advertisers
jumped ship.

195
00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:10.337
Let's interrogate
the whole system.

196
00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:12.473
Why is sexual harassment
so pervasive

197
00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:15.142
and so hard to address?

198
00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:17.044
(busy chatter)

199
00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:19.079
JODI:
Hey, do you guys have a minute?

200
00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:20.881
MATT:
Sure.

201
00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:25.452
So, I spoke to Shaunna Thomas,

202
00:11:25.486 --> 00:11:27.922
the head of UltraViolet,
a feminist group.

203
00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:30.457
She said the wrongdoing
in Hollywood is overwhelming.

204
00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:33.260
She's in touch with an actress,
Rose McGowan,

205
00:11:33.294 --> 00:11:36.130
who has tweeted about
being raped by a producer.

206
00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:38.365
Thomas says
it's Harvey Weinstein

207
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:41.001
and that McGowan is
now working on a book about it.

208
00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:43.304
Wasn't he charged with
something couple years ago?

209
00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:45.206
Yeah, um...

210
00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:48.242
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez,
an Italian model.

211
00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:51.245
She claimed Weinstein groped her
in a business meeting.

212
00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:54.516
The NYPD investigated it,
but he was never charged.

213
00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:56.116
Talk to Rose McGowan.

214
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.485
Try to talk to other actresses
he's worked with.

215
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.922
Yeah. And I'll try
to reach ex-employees.

216
00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:06.493
JODI:
<i>Hi. My name is Jodi Kantor.</i>

217
00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:08.395
<i>I'm an investigative reporter</i>
<i>for</i> The New York Times.

218
00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:10.497
<i>We're looking into sexual</i>
<i>harassment in the workplace.</i>

219
00:12:10.532 --> 00:12:13.033
<i>I believe you were</i>
<i>an employee at Miramax</i>

220
00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:15.302
<i>and worked for Harvey Weinstein</i>
<i>in the '90s.</i>

221
00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.271
WOMAN (over phone):
Are you recording this?

222
00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:19.907
No, absolutely not, and I won't
quote from this conversation

223
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.375
without your permission.

224
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.511
But in your time as an
assistant, were you aware of

225
00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:25.312
any instances
in which Harvey Weinstein

226
00:12:25.346 --> 00:12:28.983
treated women inappropriately
or crossed a line?

227
00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:32.152
Did Harvey cross a line?
(scoffs)

228
00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:33.320
(line clicks)

229
00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:36.390
Would you like to hear
her heartbeat?

230
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.826
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:41.161
(fetal heartbeat pulsing
over speakers)

232
00:12:42.296 --> 00:12:45.165
JODI: <i>Mary, thanks so much</i>
<i>for calling me back.</i>

233
00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:47.101
MARY (over phone):
Who have you talked to?

234
00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:50.271
I can't tell you names, just as
I would never divulge yours,

235
00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:52.906
but if you wanted to share
anything that you know,

236
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.576
that would be so helpful.

237
00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:57.978
I don't think
people will want to talk.

238
00:12:58.012 --> 00:12:59.079
Sorry.

239
00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:00.214
(line clicks)

240
00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.122
(laughs)

241
00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:11.358
JODI: <i>Ms. Godrèche, thank you</i>
<i>so much for responding.</i>

242
00:13:11.392 --> 00:13:13.193
JUDITH:
<i>Before you continue,</i>

243
00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:15.262
<i>I've talked about Weinstein</i>
<i>in the past, but it's private.</i>

244
00:13:15.296 --> 00:13:18.399
<i>My immigration lawyer does not</i>
<i>want me to be involved.</i>

245
00:13:18.432 --> 00:13:20.234
(line clicks, beeps)

246
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.270
Involved in what?

247
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:26.874
(line ringing)

248
00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:30.110
-ROSE (over phone): Hello?
-Oh, hi, Rose.

249
00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:33.247
Um, this is Jodi Kantor
from <i>The New York Times.</i>

250
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.115
I wrote you an email.

251
00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:37.519
Shaunna Thomas suggested
you might be willing to have

252
00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:39.554
a conversation with me
about Hollywood,

253
00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:42.056
and specifically
Harvey Weinstein.

254
00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:44.325
-Are you writing about him?
-Yes, I am.

255
00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:47.995
Look, I don't feel that inclined
to talk to you about it.

256
00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:49.196
JODI:
Could I ask why not?

257
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.864
ROSE:
I've been treated quite shabbily

258
00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:53.100
by your paper numerous times,

259
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:57.871
and I believe
the root of it is sexism.

260
00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.306
I'm sorry
that was your experience.

261
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.077
I've talked in the past,
and nothing happened.

262
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.478
I spoke at
a political meeting recently,

263
00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:08.916
and <i>The New York Times</i>
put it in the Style section.

264
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:12.953
It does damage to shout,
and no one listens.

265
00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:16.357
I'm investigating
systemic sexism in Hollywood.

266
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.225
How many pages have you got?

267
00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.493
No.

268
00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:21.462
I put myself on the line before,

269
00:14:21.495 --> 00:14:23.230
and it made no difference.

270
00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:26.367
I've written about the
workplace at Amazon, Starbucks

271
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.471
and Harvard Business School,
and change did happen.

272
00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:32.039
They reformed their policies

273
00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:34.375
as a direct result
of the <i>Times</i> articles.

274
00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.977
But if you don't want to talk,
I understand.

275
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.279
And good luck with your book.

276
00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:41.949
Thank you. Goodbye.

277
00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:46.521
RON:
I spoke to Dad.

278
00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:48.422
He sounded worse.

279
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.527
I got to go see him soon.

280
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.994
Could you go for a long weekend?

281
00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:56.163
You could take the girls.

282
00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.932
I could take Talia
but not both of them.

283
00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.506
(sighs)

284
00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:06.373
I'm having an affair.

285
00:15:07.675 --> 00:15:10.444
With a very famous actress.

286
00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.213
You want her number?

287
00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:18.218
(chuckles)

288
00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:22.089
-She's so hot.
-(laughs)

289
00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:24.057
This looks beautiful.

290
00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:27.027
-You'd really like her.
-(laughs)

291
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.432
"I am a nasty woman.

292
00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:33.967
(crowd cheering)

293
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.469
"I'm not as nasty

294
00:15:35.503 --> 00:15:39.507
as using little girls like
Pokémon before their bodies..."

295
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:42.042
-Is that Ashley Judd?
-Yeah.

296
00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:44.712
She wrote about
being sexually harassed

297
00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:46.714
by a producer in the '90s.

298
00:15:46.748 --> 00:15:50.484
She doesn't name him,
but she describes him as

299
00:15:50.518 --> 00:15:54.388
"one of our industry's most
famous admired/reviled bosses."

300
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:55.989
Mm.

301
00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:58.593
"...sexual assault, transphobia,

302
00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:01.462
"white supremacy, misogyny,

303
00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:03.765
-ignorance, white privilege."
-(Violet crying in distance)

304
00:16:03.798 --> 00:16:05.733
-I'll go.
-I'll get her.

305
00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:09.102
-TALIA: Mom!
-(chuckles)

306
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.371
-We'll both go.
-Yeah.

307
00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:15.008
(voice breaking):
I don't know if I can do this.

308
00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.376
(sobs softly)

309
00:16:17.612 --> 00:16:19.379
VADIM:
You need to rest.

310
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.217
You try to sleep, maybe?

311
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:26.420
I don't want to be... (sighs)

312
00:16:27.789 --> 00:16:30.357
I just have
this constant sense of dread.

313
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.626
(sobs)

314
00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:33.595
You're tired.

315
00:16:33.628 --> 00:16:35.663
Your body's exhausted.

316
00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:37.498
(Megan sighs)

317
00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:40.434
I think I would know
if it was just that.

318
00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:43.103
(sighs)

319
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.575
-(phone vibrating)
-Mom.

320
00:16:55.683 --> 00:16:57.050
Hello?

321
00:16:57.084 --> 00:16:58.720
ROSE (over phone):
It's Rose.

322
00:16:58.753 --> 00:17:01.321
-McGowan.
-Rose, hi.

323
00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:04.124
It's not just him
you should be after.

324
00:17:04.157 --> 00:17:07.194
There's an entire machine,
a supply chain.

325
00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:09.664
Of abusers in Hollywood?

326
00:17:09.697 --> 00:17:10.698
Right.

327
00:17:10.732 --> 00:17:12.299
They're worldwide,

328
00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:16.136
wherever movies are
being made or sold.

329
00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:19.139
Each studio does
the victim-shaming and payouts.

330
00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:23.243
If white men could have
a playground, this would be it.

331
00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.549
Do people know about it?

332
00:17:27.582 --> 00:17:29.283
Of course.

333
00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:32.720
I told a lot of people
what happened to me.

334
00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:35.289
At the Sundance Film Festival?

335
00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:39.293
I was 23. I was doing all these
brilliant independent films.

336
00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:41.663
I was just incredibly hopeful.

337
00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:43.130
(door opens)

338
00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:44.699
-And then I went
to that hotel room. -Hi.

339
00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:46.534
(whispering)

340
00:17:46.568 --> 00:17:47.669
(door closes)

341
00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:49.637
RON:
Talia?

342
00:17:49.671 --> 00:17:50.872
-I'm here.
-(door closes)

343
00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.575
ROSE:
He was on a sofa,

344
00:17:53.608 --> 00:17:56.109
talking loudly on his phone.

345
00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:57.377
I waited.

346
00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:59.479
And then
we talked about projects,

347
00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:05.419
and he suddenly said,
"I have a Jacuzzi in my room."

348
00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.789
I didn't know
what the answer to that was,

349
00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:10.625
so I just kept talking.

350
00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:14.862
We wrapped up,
and he said he'd walk me out,

351
00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:18.198
and I thought,
"Well, that went well."

352
00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:20.668
It was my first big meeting.

353
00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:24.706
He walked behind me
down a hallway, then he said,

354
00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:27.374
"This is the Jacuzzi room."

355
00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:32.212
And I looked in,
and he pushed me inside.

356
00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:38.352
He stripped me,
and he was suddenly naked.

357
00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:41.522
I left my body in some way.

358
00:18:42.557 --> 00:18:44.458
And he raped me.

359
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.898
I went into survival mode to
get out, and I faked an orgasm.

360
00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.400
He told me to get dressed.

361
00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:56.904
He left me messages telling me
I was his new special friend

362
00:18:56.938 --> 00:19:00.808
and that he'd done a lot
for other actresses.

363
00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:02.677
Did you report it?

364
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.279
Can you see the law
taking my side on that?

365
00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:10.785
But you told other people?

366
00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:14.789
I told a lot of people,
and nobody did a thing.

367
00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:16.591
Nothing.

368
00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:21.796
Can I contact
the people you told?

369
00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:24.297
You told me this was private.

370
00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:29.202
He'll have spies
watching you now, as we speak.

371
00:19:29.236 --> 00:19:31.438
I hope you know that.

I just got her down.

384
00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:18.886
JODI: It's the toughest part,
I think.

MEGAN:
Is it?

386
00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.523
JODI:
I found it to be so.

387
00:20:22.557 --> 00:20:26.359
With my first daughter,
I had postpartum depression.

388
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:29.997
Everyone's so excited,

389
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:32.734
and it's like...

390
00:20:32.767 --> 00:20:34.434
you're just not there.

391
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.471
MEGAN:
Right.

392
00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:39.640
(sighs)

393
00:20:39.674 --> 00:20:41.876
So, I got your email.

394
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:43.010
How's it all going?

395
00:20:43.044 --> 00:20:45.546
Yeah. (laughs)

396
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.383
I feel like there are
a lot of women who have...

397
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.353
been through something with him.

398
00:20:54.055 --> 00:20:56.891
But they find it hard to talk.

399
00:20:56.924 --> 00:21:02.029
And those who do talk to me
don't want to go on the record.

400
00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:04.532
In your previous stories,

401
00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:06.501
how did you persuade women
to tell you

402
00:21:06.534 --> 00:21:08.401
what had happened to them?

403
00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:12.840
Yeah, so...

404
00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:14.374
It's difficult.

405
00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:16.844
They're terrified.

406
00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:18.846
A case I made was,

407
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.383
"You know, I can't change what
happened to you in the past,

408
00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:26.921
"but together we may be able
to use your experience

409
00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:29.824
to help protect other people."

410
00:21:29.857 --> 00:21:32.927
The truth, basically.

411
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.427
But yeah.

412
00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:38.599
It's hard to ask women to talk.

413
00:21:39.634 --> 00:21:41.836
-(busy chatter)

414
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.820
ASHLEY JUDD:
Then he asked me to meet him,

415
00:21:58.853 --> 00:22:00.521
uh, really early.

416
00:22:00.555 --> 00:22:04.357
And I had been up all night
filming, and I was tired.

417
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:07.562
I went over to The Peninsula
Hotel, and at reception,

418
00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:09.964
I asked, "Is Mr. Weinstein
in The Belvedere restaurant

419
00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:11.464
or is he on the patio?"

420
00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:15.136
And they said, "Go to his room."

421
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:18.371
(over laptop):
And I went upstairs,

422
00:22:18.405 --> 00:22:21.609
and Harvey was in his bathrobe.

423
00:22:21.642 --> 00:22:24.979
And he asked if
he could give me a massage.

424
00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:27.982
"No," I said.

425
00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:29.851
And then, um, he asked me

426
00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:31.986
to help him pick out
his clothes for the day.

427
00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:36.489
He, you know, started asking
for all these things,

428
00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:39.594
increasingly more sexual,
getting closer and closer.

429
00:22:39.627 --> 00:22:42.864
And I just said no
so many different times

430
00:22:42.897 --> 00:22:45.600
and in so many different ways.

431
00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:50.004
And then he finally, um, asked
me to watch him take a shower.

432
00:22:50.037 --> 00:22:52.874
And I said, "Harvey,

433
00:22:52.907 --> 00:22:57.612
"when I win an Academy Award
in a Miramax movie,

434
00:22:57.645 --> 00:22:59.513
I will give you a blow job."

435
00:22:59.547 --> 00:23:01.983
And I got out of there fast.

436
00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:03.618
What did you do?

437
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:06.020
I told my dad, I told my agent,

438
00:23:06.053 --> 00:23:08.890
I told the people with whom
I was filming that night,

439
00:23:08.923 --> 00:23:10.558
and Harvey punished me.

440
00:23:10.591 --> 00:23:12.760
I mean, he blackballed my career

441
00:23:12.793 --> 00:23:15.029
because I had the wherewithal
to refuse him.

442
00:23:15.062 --> 00:23:16.597
How do you know that?

443
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:18.132
I would be standing
with other actresses,

444
00:23:18.165 --> 00:23:19.533
and he would blank me.

445
00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:21.636
There were roles
for which I was up

446
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:23.571
that I mysteriously did not get,

447
00:23:23.604 --> 00:23:25.940
and I know today that it was
Harvey making a phone call.

448
00:23:25.973 --> 00:23:30.443
You know I did an article about
it, and nobody did anything.

449
00:23:30.477 --> 00:23:33.514
You didn't identify him,
but did industry people know

450
00:23:33.547 --> 00:23:35.216
who you were talking about
in your article?

451
00:23:35.249 --> 00:23:36.851
Absolutely.

452
00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:39.987
And the abuse came raining down
on me, not on him.

453
00:23:40.021 --> 00:23:41.188
You know at the Women's March

454
00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:42.990
when I did
the "Nasty Woman" poem?

455
00:23:43.024 --> 00:23:45.927
I lost a huge advertising gig
because a small group of people

456
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.063
complained that I was
quoting the president.

457
00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:51.565
He used that language
and got elected.

458
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:54.535
I quoted him, and I got fired.

459
00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:57.605
It is decades later,
and it's still the same sexism.

460
00:23:57.638 --> 00:24:01.075
And, Jodi, I would make
the same choices all over again,

461
00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:03.577
but I also would like to work.

462
00:24:06.814 --> 00:24:09.482
JODI: <i>Lisa Bloom, the lawyer,</i>
<i>she wrote to me.</i>

463
00:24:09.517 --> 00:24:11.085
-Gloria Allred's daughter?
-Yeah.

464
00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:12.720
-Do you know her?
-No.

465
00:24:12.753 --> 00:24:14.522
But I assume she wants to help.

466
00:24:14.555 --> 00:24:16.123
I forwarded the email to Emily.

467
00:24:16.157 --> 00:24:17.558
(busy chatter)

468
00:24:17.591 --> 00:24:18.859
WOMAN:
I'm looking at it right now.

469
00:24:18.893 --> 00:24:21.729
Yeah.
This is straight from legal.

470
00:24:23.097 --> 00:24:25.967
EMILY:
Jodi? Lisa Bloom.

471
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.568
"Big announcement:

472
00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:29.537
"My book, <i>Suspicion Nation,</i>
is being produced

by Harvey Weinstein and Jay-Z."

474
00:24:32.139 --> 00:24:34.809
Weinstein is producing her book?

475
00:24:34.842 --> 00:24:37.778
EMILY: Lisa Bloom,
daughter of feminist icon,

476
00:24:37.812 --> 00:24:39.981
is working with
Harvey Weinstein.

477
00:24:40.014 --> 00:24:41.716
But why would she do that?

478
00:24:41.749 --> 00:24:43.718
How much do you get paid
for a miniseries?

479
00:24:43.751 --> 00:24:46.587
He's got to be behind
Lisa reaching out to you.

480
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.489
So Weinstein knows
what we're doing.

481
00:24:50.257 --> 00:24:53.027
-(traffic rumbling)
-(horns honking)

482
00:24:57.164 --> 00:24:58.866
Sorry.

483
00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:04.805
MATT: Do you want
to keep going with Trump?

484
00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:07.875
REBECCA: Or you could join Jodi
and look into Harvey Weinstein.

485

(chuckles)

486
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.615
I worry about
whether it makes a difference.

487
00:25:14.648 --> 00:25:16.650
These women spoke out
against Trump,

488
00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:18.019
and he still became president.

489
00:25:18.052 --> 00:25:20.721
But in the wake of O'Reilly,
there's possibility.

490
00:25:20.755 --> 00:25:22.723
-(phone vibrating)
-Sorry.

491
00:25:23.657 --> 00:25:25.993

493
00:25:27.294 --> 00:25:29.330
You've got to show up.

494
00:25:29.363 --> 00:25:31.632
How's your daughter?

495
00:25:31.665 --> 00:25:33.901

496
00:25:35.069 --> 00:25:37.304
Oh, s-- um...

497
00:25:37.338 --> 00:25:39.173
Sorry. I, um...

498
00:25:39.206 --> 00:25:43.010
Thank you
for the gift you, um...

499
00:25:43.811 --> 00:25:45.913
Is anything bothering you?

500
00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:48.682
Besides no sleep
and diapers everywhere.

501
00:25:50.317 --> 00:25:52.153
Are you okay?

502
00:25:54.355 --> 00:25:57.324
(softly):
I found it quite...

503
00:25:57.358 --> 00:25:59.927
difficult.

504
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.662
I'm sorry.

505
00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:03.297
Will working help?

506
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.067
Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.334
Absolutely.

508
00:26:07.368 --> 00:26:09.036
It's better now.

509
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.105
(busy chatter)

510
00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:19.180
MAN:
Megan.

511
00:26:19.213 --> 00:26:20.881
(chuckles):
Hey.

512
00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:37.131
MEGAN:
Are they all famous?

513
00:26:37.164 --> 00:26:38.699
JODI:
Most of them, yes.

514
00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:41.969
I guess my question
is just, like:

515
00:26:42.002 --> 00:26:44.238
Is this the best use
of our time?

516
00:26:44.271 --> 00:26:45.773
Like, as opposed to

517
00:26:45.806 --> 00:26:48.843
other people we could
potentially be covering.

518
00:26:48.876 --> 00:26:52.246
People who can't speak out.
Actresses already have a voice.

519
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:54.048
But they could also fear
being punished

520
00:26:54.081 --> 00:26:56.150
by the film industry
for using it.

521
00:26:56.183 --> 00:26:58.719
Sure.

522
00:26:58.752 --> 00:27:01.956
But what is it exactly
that we're looking at here?

523
00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:05.726
We're looking at extreme sexual
harassment in the workplace.

524
00:27:06.427 --> 00:27:08.262
These young women walked into

525
00:27:08.295 --> 00:27:10.397

believe were business meetings

526
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:12.299
with a producer, an employer.

527
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:14.068
They were hopeful.

528
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:16.270
They were expecting a serious
conversation about their work

529
00:27:16.303 --> 00:27:17.972
or a possible project.

530
00:27:18.005 --> 00:27:21.809

were targeted, too?

Yes.

I found records of a complaint

541
00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:53.007
against Miramax from 2001,

542
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.443
but the report was closed out
the same day it was made.

543
00:27:56.477 --> 00:27:59.046
It says, "complainant elected
court action,"

544
00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:01.115
but then
no court documents exist,

545
00:28:01.148 --> 00:28:02.750
which seems inconsistent.

546
00:28:02.783 --> 00:28:05.452

any more information on that?

547
00:28:05.486 --> 00:28:06.887

No, those records

550

It's agency policy.

551

harassing someone.

you can help me?

564

of the government investigator

565

JODI: She just talked as though
he was kind of naughty.

571
00:29:13.555 --> 00:29:15.856
She was talking to me
kind of Jew-to-Jew

Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner.

speak freely about the payouts,

or if there are fewer than
15 employees in the workplace.

Also, most lawyers
prefer settlements

Don't let Weinstein talk to you,

No, if Harvey has
something to say,

853
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:58.439
he needs to say it publicly.

854
00:43:58.472 --> 00:44:00.674

00:46:20.848 --> 00:46:24.852
The cops seemed
pretty confident there was.

875
00:46:24.885 --> 00:46:26.521
Do you think
there was anything irregular

876
00:46:26.554 --> 00:46:27.555
about how it was handled?

877
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:29.323
I don't.

878
00:46:29.356 --> 00:46:30.858
Why would you say that?

879
00:46:30.891 --> 00:46:33.327
-(ringtone playing)
-(siren passing)

880
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.495
Gwyneth.

881
00:46:34.529 --> 00:46:36.030
GWYNETH (over phone):
He's here.

882
00:46:36.063 --> 00:46:39.099
I invited a few people over,
and he turned up.

883
00:46:39.133 --> 00:46:40.901
I haven't seen him for years.

884
00:46:40.934 --> 00:46:43.103
He must know I spoke to you.

885
00:46:43.137 --> 00:46:45.439
Why are you so certain
there was no criminal conduct?

886
00:46:45.472 --> 00:46:47.107
Wasn't there a recording?

887
00:46:47.141 --> 00:46:48.576
Uh...

888
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.512
I don't think
there's a road to go down.

889
00:46:50.545 --> 00:46:52.146
No.

890
00:46:53.113 --> 00:46:55.015
Do you feel like you're in
physical danger at all?

891
00:46:55.049 --> 00:46:57.484
GWYNETH: I'll keep people
around me till he goes.

892
00:46:57.519 --> 00:46:59.320
It's a shock.
I know he's watching me.

893
00:46:59.353 --> 00:47:01.221
He's letting me know.

894
00:47:02.356 --> 00:47:04.458
He can't do anything.

895
00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:05.993
Gwyneth.

896
00:47:06.026 --> 00:47:08.495
I'm here.
Call me if you need me.

897
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.164
Okay. Bye.

898
00:47:11.666 --> 00:47:13.867
Linda, do you know Harvey?

899
00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:15.603
I've met him socially,

900
00:47:15.637 --> 00:47:18.172
but we've never been
to each other's homes.

901
00:47:18.205 --> 00:47:19.940
Okay.

902
00:47:19.973 --> 00:47:22.376
-I'm sure we'll speak soon.
-Yes.

903
00:47:22.409 --> 00:47:24.878
Goodbye.

904
00:47:29.551 --> 00:47:32.554
We got a good lead to talk
to a past executive at Miramax.

905
00:47:32.587 --> 00:47:34.154
-Great. When will that be?
-MAN: Hey. Hola.

906
00:47:34.188 --> 00:47:35.623
Jodi's talking to her tomorrow.

907
00:47:35.657 --> 00:47:36.990
MAN 2: Hey, I don't think
she heard you.

908
00:47:37.024 --> 00:47:38.292
She definitely didn't hear you.

909
00:47:38.325 --> 00:47:41.028
-Oh, my God.
-What?

910
00:47:41.663 --> 00:47:44.632
Ronan Farrow is working on

911
00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:47.434
an H.W. piece
for <i>The New Yorker.</i>

912
00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:48.603
What? Since when?

913
00:47:48.636 --> 00:47:50.304
-Fuck.
-JODI: She doesn't say,

914
00:47:50.337 --> 00:47:53.508
but apparently he's spoken
to a lot of actresses already.

915
00:47:53.541 --> 00:47:54.509
WAITRESS:
Okay, ladies.

916
00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:56.176
These are the menus.

917
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.612
-Thank you. -All right.
-REBECCA: Thank you.

918
00:47:57.645 --> 00:47:59.547
It's pressure we can do without,

919
00:47:59.581 --> 00:48:03.984
but we just keep going,
and we continue to be thorough.

920
00:48:04.017 --> 00:48:05.986
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Hello. Hi. Hello, everyone.

921
00:48:06.019 --> 00:48:07.921
Uh, did you, did you see
my friend over there?

922
00:48:07.955 --> 00:48:09.256
He-he said hi.

923
00:48:09.289 --> 00:48:10.157
Could you leave us?

924
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.092
-We're talking.
-I absolutely will.

925
00:48:12.126 --> 00:48:13.427
I totally understand,
but I was just thinking

926
00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.129
maybe I could just have
a moment of your time.

927
00:48:15.162 --> 00:48:16.130
All right, man.
We're having a conversation.

928
00:48:16.163 --> 00:48:17.398
So, if you could just...

929
00:48:17.431 --> 00:48:18.932
You should be doing
something else, though.

930
00:48:18.966 --> 00:48:20.401
-Fuck you. (scoffs)
-Fuck you?

931
00:48:20.434 --> 00:48:21.536
I would bend you over...

932
00:48:21.569 --> 00:48:23.170
Fuck you!

933
00:48:24.037 --> 00:48:25.540
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of here!

934
00:48:25.573 --> 00:48:27.675
Fuck you, man! Get the fuck out!

935
00:48:27.709 --> 00:48:30.512
(man laughs)

936
00:48:30.545 --> 00:48:31.646
-Wow.
-Frigid bitches.

937
00:48:31.679 --> 00:48:34.181
MAN:
Frigid bitches. (laughs)

938
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.552
-MEGAN (whispers): Sorry.
-Don't apologize.

939
00:48:37.585 --> 00:48:39.386
(scoffs)

940
00:48:42.222 --> 00:48:44.391
-(traffic rumbling)
-(footsteps running)

941
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.739
WOMAN: There was an incident
in Venice at the film festival.

942
00:48:57.772 --> 00:49:00.575
It was '98.

943
00:49:00.608 --> 00:49:02.342
What happened?

944
00:49:04.011 --> 00:49:05.747
(sighs softly)

945
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.617
What makes me most angry
is the silence.

946
00:49:09.651 --> 00:49:14.221
No one spoke out then, and
no one is talking about it now.

947
00:49:14.254 --> 00:49:17.324
He built the silence,
and people complied.

948
00:49:17.357 --> 00:49:20.294
He produced fear
and intimidation.

949
00:49:20.327 --> 00:49:22.362
The only alternative,
seemingly, was to quit

950
00:49:22.396 --> 00:49:25.332
and throw away everything
you worked so hard for

951
00:49:25.365 --> 00:49:26.467
out the door.

952
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:28.603
You were terrified you were
gonna be the next target,

953
00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:30.471
so people looked the other way.

954
00:49:30.505 --> 00:49:34.074
-Within the company?
-Yes, and outside of it.

955
00:49:34.107 --> 00:49:36.711
I mean, he played the press.
He played the agents.

956
00:49:36.744 --> 00:49:38.613
How did he play the press?

957
00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:40.347
By promising them
access to stars

958
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.483
in exchange for
hushing up some incident.

959
00:49:42.517 --> 00:49:44.451
What sort of incident?

960
00:49:45.285 --> 00:49:47.655
(chuckles) Where do I start?

961
00:49:47.689 --> 00:49:50.457
Harvey had this--
what did they call it?--

962
00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:56.163
"a physical altercation" with a
male employee at a conference.

963
00:49:56.196 --> 00:49:57.665
Then they settled with the guy.

964
00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:00.100
And with women?

965
00:50:01.401 --> 00:50:03.370
He pursued them.

966
00:50:03.403 --> 00:50:05.205
Endlessly.

967
00:50:08.275 --> 00:50:10.410
What happened in Venice?

968
00:50:12.547 --> 00:50:14.348
I don't want to be quoted.

969
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:15.315
Period.

970
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:17.317
Understood.

971
00:50:21.288 --> 00:50:22.657
We were in Harvey's suite,

972
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:25.660
and (sniffles) there were
a bunch of people in there.

973
00:50:25.693 --> 00:50:28.195
And there were
these two assistants,

974
00:50:28.228 --> 00:50:31.064
and they were
sitting there trembling.

975
00:50:31.098 --> 00:50:32.734
And Weinstein was there?

976
00:50:32.767 --> 00:50:34.802
Yes.

977
00:50:34.836 --> 00:50:38.405
He was talking film
and ignoring them,

978
00:50:38.438 --> 00:50:41.341
but they were
literally vibrating.

979
00:50:41.375 --> 00:50:45.112
One with fear,
the other with anger.

980
00:50:47.314 --> 00:50:49.283
Can you tell me their names?

981
00:50:49.316 --> 00:50:51.151
Yes.

982
00:50:56.189 --> 00:50:59.694
And there's another woman
you should, you should call.

983
00:50:59.727 --> 00:51:03.330
The two assistants are
Rowena Chiu and Zelda Perkins,

984
00:51:03.363 --> 00:51:06.433
and we have a third name,
Laura Madden.

985
00:51:06.466 --> 00:51:09.202
And none of them
are returning our calls.

986
00:51:09.236 --> 00:51:11.171
So? Show up in person.

987
00:51:11.204 --> 00:51:13.440
Yeah. (chuckles)

988
00:51:13.473 --> 00:51:17.779
They live in London,
Silicon Valley and Wales.

989
00:51:17.812 --> 00:51:20.213
Can you get on a plane?

990
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.652
(laughs)

991
00:51:26.888 --> 00:51:30.290
Let me work it out with Ron.

992
00:51:32.894 --> 00:51:35.897
But yeah, of course.

993
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:37.599
Documents, verification.

994
00:51:37.632 --> 00:51:39.299
You know what we need.

995
00:51:39.333 --> 00:51:41.368
♪ ♪

996
00:52:02.857 --> 00:52:05.258
♪ ♪

997
00:52:10.898 --> 00:52:12.600
(car door opens)

998
00:52:17.237 --> 00:52:19.406
(dog barking in distance)

999
00:52:22.677 --> 00:52:24.912
JODI:
Hi.

1000
00:52:24.946 --> 00:52:27.649
Sorry to bother you.
I can see you're busy.

1001
00:52:27.682 --> 00:52:30.918
I was looking for Rowena Chiu.

1002
00:52:30.952 --> 00:52:32.553
Hi.

1003
00:52:32.587 --> 00:52:35.790
Rowena's not here right now.
Can I give her a message?

1004
00:52:35.823 --> 00:52:37.859
When will she be back?

1005
00:52:37.892 --> 00:52:40.795
My wife's out of the country
for a while.

1006
00:52:40.828 --> 00:52:42.195
(chuckles) I see.

1007
00:52:42.229 --> 00:52:44.799
I did try calling her.

1008
00:52:44.832 --> 00:52:46.333
This a work thing?

1009
00:52:46.366 --> 00:52:48.468
No. You must be Andrew?

1010
00:52:48.503 --> 00:52:49.537
Andrew Cheung?

1011
00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:52.540
I'm Jodi Kantor.
I'm from <i>The New York Times.</i>

1012
00:52:52.573 --> 00:52:54.274
Okay.

1013
00:52:54.307 --> 00:52:58.245
So, what did you want
to talk to Rowena about?

1014
00:52:58.278 --> 00:53:01.348
We're researching a story
about Miramax.

1015
00:53:01.381 --> 00:53:04.284
I flew in from New York.

1016
00:53:04.317 --> 00:53:06.587
-You came all this way?
-Yeah.

1017
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:07.922
(Andrew chuckles)

1018
00:53:07.955 --> 00:53:10.625
Um, could we talk for a minute?

1019
00:53:10.658 --> 00:53:11.993
Sure.

1020
00:53:12.026 --> 00:53:15.295
So, I've been speaking
with people

1021
00:53:15.328 --> 00:53:18.566
who worked for Harvey Weinstein.

1022
00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:22.436
You're going quite far back
with Rowena's time there.

1023
00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:24.438
We're writing about
his treatment of women.

1024
00:53:24.471 --> 00:53:25.740
Right.

1025
00:53:25.773 --> 00:53:28.843
And Rowena fits in how?

1026
00:53:29.744 --> 00:53:33.380
Your wife worked at Miramax
for some years.

1027
00:53:33.413 --> 00:53:35.382
Yes.

1028
00:53:35.415 --> 00:53:36.651
Mainly in Hong Kong.

1029
00:53:36.684 --> 00:53:38.653
Like to hear about
her experiences

1030
00:53:38.686 --> 00:53:40.320
working for Weinstein.

1031
00:53:40.353 --> 00:53:43.256
I'm confused why you can't
discuss it on the phone.

1032
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.660
(laughs) I did try.

1033
00:53:45.693 --> 00:53:48.228
It is always better
to actually meet.

1034
00:53:49.897 --> 00:53:51.733
So...

1035
00:53:53.501 --> 00:53:56.571
And this is off the record.

1036
00:53:56.604 --> 00:53:58.639
My understanding is that...
(stammers)

1037
00:53:58.673 --> 00:54:00.608
that Weinstein
possibly victimized your wife

1038
00:54:00.641 --> 00:54:02.844
when Rowena
first worked for him.

1039
00:54:06.379 --> 00:54:10.017
Rowena's never mentioned
anything like that to me.

1040
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:11.886
What-what do you mean
by "victimized"?

1041
00:54:11.919 --> 00:54:13.521
Can you be more specific?

1042
00:54:14.822 --> 00:54:16.389
I was told that your wife

1043
00:54:16.423 --> 00:54:18.793
may have received a settlement
from Weinstein.

1044
00:54:19.761 --> 00:54:23.263
(scoffs) Do I look like a guy
whose wife got a settlement?

1045
00:54:24.498 --> 00:54:26.968
Could you have confused her
with someone else?

1046
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:29.904
I-I... I apologize
for taking up your time.

1047
00:54:29.937 --> 00:54:31.371
I'm...

1048
00:54:31.404 --> 00:54:34.609
Will you just please
give this to Rowena?

1049
00:54:34.642 --> 00:54:36.043
If you're talking
to these other people,

1050
00:54:36.077 --> 00:54:37.545
why do you need
to talk to Rowena?

1051
00:54:37.578 --> 00:54:40.782
And if you turn up
in my driveway,

1052
00:54:40.815 --> 00:54:42.583
what kind of victimization?

1053
00:54:42.617 --> 00:54:44.018
It's complex.

1054
00:54:44.051 --> 00:54:46.386
I'm asking you to expand on it.

1055
00:54:46.419 --> 00:54:50.525
I really think
it would be best...

1056
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:53.326
...if you asked Rowena.

1057
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.328
Have a good day.

<i>I just couldn't lie to him.</i>

1060
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:12.113
And then it turns out
he didn't know.

1061
00:55:12.146 --> 00:55:13.948
What if London is
a repeat of this?

1062
00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:15.516
It won't be.

1063
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:17.718
I spoke with an
employment lawyer in the U.K.,

1064
00:55:17.752 --> 00:55:21.388
and he told me that
it was irresponsible of me

1065
00:55:21.421 --> 00:55:23.423
even to ask about
breaching NDAs.

1066
00:55:23.456 --> 00:55:24.992
No one does it.
They would get sued.

1067
00:55:25.026 --> 00:55:26.627
Fuck that guy.

1068
00:55:26.661 --> 00:55:29.897
Honestly, Jodi, fuck him.
He has no idea.

-And how was it?
-It was great.

In what way?

1128
00:58:55.669 --> 00:58:59.340
Everyone became on call

Script meetings, discussions
and more personal stuff.

1131
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:08.682
Like?

1132
00:59:08.716 --> 00:59:11.185
For instance,
I would have to go to his hotel

1133
00:59:11.218 --> 00:59:13.320
and wake Harvey up.

1134
00:59:13.354 --> 00:59:15.056
Run his shower for him.

1135
00:59:15.089 --> 00:59:16.657
Get him out of bed.

1136
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.192
He would usually be naked.

1137
00:59:18.225 --> 00:59:20.227
And he might try
to pull me onto him.

1138
00:59:20.261 --> 00:59:22.029
What did you do?

1139
00:59:22.063 --> 00:59:23.631
I'd fend him off.

1140
00:59:23.664 --> 00:59:26.667
I found humor or aggression
worked best.

1141
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.604
Harvey was either
excited or furious.

1142
00:59:30.638 --> 00:59:32.840
You never knew
which it would be.

1143
00:59:33.774 --> 00:59:36.343
Did anyone on the team
give you advice about him?

1144
00:59:36.377 --> 00:59:37.978
Yes. (chuckles)

1145
00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:40.948
Once, one girl told me to
always wear my puffer jacket,

1146
00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:43.851
um, and to always sit
in an armchair,

1147
00:59:43.884 --> 00:59:48.022
never the sofa next to him,
which helped.

1148
00:59:48.055 --> 00:59:52.393
And that's how I knew that
it wasn't only happening to me.

1149
00:59:52.426 --> 00:59:54.829

1150

I was just too young

Harvey wanted people
to submit to him.

And if they didn't?

1155
01:00:05.706 --> 01:00:07.108
Well, then he'd roar.

1156
01:00:07.141 --> 01:00:08.642

01:01:59.386 --> 01:02:00.988
"You need to come with me
right now."

1199
01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:03.490
You went right up to them
and confronted him?

1200
01:02:03.525 --> 01:02:05.960

1201

1202

1204
01:02:14.835 --> 01:02:18.372

Then I knew he did it.

1205
01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:20.140
And then?

1206
01:02:20.174 --> 01:02:21.509
He denied it.

1207
01:02:21.543 --> 01:02:23.010
He said, "I swear on my wife
and kids' lives

1208
01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:24.311
that I did not assault
that young woman."

1209

I knew that he was lying.

1210
01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:28.949
He always used that line

1211
01:02:28.983 --> 01:02:31.151
as a "get out of jail free"
card. Always.

1212
01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:35.557
Did the assistant
report it to the police?

1213
01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:38.892
Mm. She told no one.

1214
01:02:40.494 --> 01:02:42.429

1215
01:02:42.463 --> 01:02:43.797
We both resigned.

1216
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:45.232
I told my direct superior,

1217
01:02:45.266 --> 01:02:49.537
who suggested
we get ourselves a good lawyer.

1218
01:02:49.571 --> 01:02:51.438
I had no idea where to get one.

1219

1222
01:02:57.177 --> 01:02:59.313
But our lawyer said
we had no chance

1223
01:02:59.346 --> 01:03:01.482
and the only thing to do
was to agree to a settlement.

1224
01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:02.983
And I said categorically no,

1225
01:03:03.017 --> 01:03:04.552
that no money
should change hands

1226
01:03:04.586 --> 01:03:06.153
and that we just wanted
to stop him.

1227
01:03:06.186 --> 01:03:08.856
And no U.K. police
were involved?

1228
01:03:08.889 --> 01:03:10.291
We had no case.

1229
01:03:10.324 --> 01:03:12.426
We had no evidence and
no police report from Venice.

1230
01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.028
And, you see, with rape,

1231
01:03:14.061 --> 01:03:15.829
it is impossibly difficult
to get a prosecution.

1232
01:03:15.863 --> 01:03:17.298
And the lawyers kept saying

1233
01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:19.933
damage limitation
was the only way to go.

1234
01:03:19.967 --> 01:03:22.136
So I said, "All right, then.

1235
01:03:22.169 --> 01:03:23.904
We have our own
very real demands."

1236
01:03:23.937 --> 01:03:25.839
Conditions that Harvey
would have to meet

1237
01:03:25.873 --> 01:03:26.974
if we were to sign.

1238
01:03:27.007 --> 01:03:28.442
And what were those conditions?

1239
01:03:28.475 --> 01:03:31.111
We demanded that if Harvey
had another settlement

1240
01:03:31.145 --> 01:03:33.414
within two years, that it had
to be reported to Disney

1241
01:03:33.447 --> 01:03:34.882
or else he would be fired.

1242
01:03:34.915 --> 01:03:37.451
Another was that
he would go to therapy,

1243
01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:38.919
with me present initially

1244
01:03:38.952 --> 01:03:40.988
so that he couldn't lie
to the therapist.

1245
01:03:41.021 --> 01:03:43.591
We demanded that
HR would put in a system

1246
01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:46.060
to protect the women and staff.

1247
01:03:46.093 --> 01:03:48.962
And it felt like if we could
achieve all of those,

1248
01:03:48.996 --> 01:03:50.964
then that's what our silence
was paying for,

1249
01:03:50.998 --> 01:03:54.068
that we were paying
for him to stop.

1250
01:03:55.637 --> 01:03:57.237
So we signed.

1251
01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:00.341
And they had their own
insane conditions for us.

1252
01:04:00.374 --> 01:04:02.076
What were they?

1253
01:04:02.976 --> 01:04:04.512
I tried to commit them
to memory.

1254
01:04:04.546 --> 01:04:06.380
Um, they wouldn't give us
our own copy.

1255
01:04:06.413 --> 01:04:08.082
What?

1256
01:04:08.115 --> 01:04:10.084
I was only given visitation
rights to my own settlement.

1257
01:04:10.117 --> 01:04:12.453
That's in... (stammers)

1258

But you memorized them?

1260
01:04:17.424 --> 01:04:23.030
I asked for letters, too, which
stated some of the conditions.

01:04:23.063 --> 01:04:26.501
One said,

in a criminal or civil case."

1263

We weren't allowed to talk
to our family or a doctor.

1264
01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:39.913
So finally we signed.

1265
01:04:39.947 --> 01:04:42.550
They gave us some money.

1266
01:04:42.584 --> 01:04:45.352

1398
01:11:27.655 --> 01:11:28.923
<i>He was charming.</i>

1399
01:11:28.956 --> 01:11:32.794
<i>He was saying</i>
<i>he'd heard how hard I worked.</i>

1400
01:11:32.827 --> 01:11:35.730
<i>And I was just excited.</i>

1401
01:11:36.664 --> 01:11:41.301
<i>I was 21, you know,</i>
<i>very young but incredibly keen.</i>

1402
01:11:42.435 --> 01:11:44.572
<i>So when he said</i>
<i>he'd give me a permanent job</i>

1403
01:11:44.605 --> 01:11:48.676
<i>at the London office,</i>
<i>I felt so happy.</i>

1404
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:50.845
JODI:
<i>He said that in the meeting?</i>

1405
01:11:50.878 --> 01:11:52.379
LAURA:
<i>Yes.</i>

1406
01:11:52.412 --> 01:11:55.616
He was in his bathrobe
when he opened the door,

1407
01:11:55.650 --> 01:12:00.420
but I thought
that was maybe very Hollywood.

1408
01:12:00.453 --> 01:12:03.024
But quite soon into talking,

1409
01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:05.827
he said,
would I give him a massage?

1410
01:12:08.062 --> 01:12:10.064
I-I said no.

1411
01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:11.532
He was very matter-of-fact.

1412
01:12:11.566 --> 01:12:13.868
He said it's not
a romantic request.

1413
01:12:13.901 --> 01:12:16.403
Everyone does it for him.

1414
01:12:16.436 --> 01:12:18.506
It's part of the job.

1415
01:12:20.741 --> 01:12:25.713
So, I suddenly thought that
I was the problem, you know.

1416
01:12:25.746 --> 01:12:29.482
That I was the one
who was sexualizing it.

1417
01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:32.887
That I was just
young and uptight.

1418
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.622
So, I...

1419
01:12:35.556 --> 01:12:37.625
...I put my hands
on his shoulders,

1420
01:12:37.658 --> 01:12:42.730
but I couldn't actually
move them at all over his body.

1421
01:12:42.763 --> 01:12:44.966
I just stood there.

1422
01:12:44.999 --> 01:12:46.868
My hands wouldn't move.

1423
01:12:46.901 --> 01:12:52.173
And then he said he would
give me a massage first.

1424
01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:54.542
To relax me.

1425
01:12:56.711 --> 01:13:00.882
And he said,
"Look, all the girls do it.

1426
01:13:00.915 --> 01:13:03.450
It's just work."

1427
01:13:03.483 --> 01:13:06.087
And then he said,
"Take your top off."

1428
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.756
Very matter-of-fact.

1429
01:13:08.789 --> 01:13:10.858
"Take your bra off."

1430
01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:18.199
And I did.

1431
01:13:18.232 --> 01:13:22.536
I was terrified,
but I just thought,

1432
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:25.640
"Get through it. Do it."

1433
01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:29.476
<i>And then my trousers were off,</i>

1434
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:33.781
<i>and he was standing over me...</i>

1435
01:13:33.814 --> 01:13:36.050
<i>masturbating.</i>

1436
01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:39.787
<i>I asked him to leave me alone,</i>

1437
01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.924
<i>but he kept asking</i>
<i>for different things.</i>

1438
01:13:42.957 --> 01:13:46.694
<i>And then he suggested a shower,</i>
<i>and I got up.</i>

1439
01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:50.932
<i>And he carried on...</i>

1440
01:13:50.965 --> 01:13:53.034
<i>masturbating.</i>

1441
01:13:53.067 --> 01:13:55.069
<i>And I kept crying.</i>

1442
01:13:55.102 --> 01:13:58.072
<i>And I was sobbing,</i>
<i>and the water was pouring down,</i>

1443
01:13:58.105 --> 01:14:02.944
<i>and he was still masturbating.</i>

1444
01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:05.546
<i>Then he got angry.</i>

1445
01:14:05.579 --> 01:14:09.583
<i>I think my crying was so loud</i>
<i>it put him off.</i>

1446
01:14:09.617 --> 01:14:14.555
<i>And he left the bathroom,</i>
<i>and I locked the door.</i>

1447
01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:15.990
(shower running)

1448
01:14:16.023 --> 01:14:19.961
<i>And I could still hear him</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

1449
01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:23.764
<i>Still the sounds</i>
<i>of him masturbating.</i>

1450
01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:27.802
<i>Finally, I went back</i>
<i>into the room itself</i>

1451
01:14:27.835 --> 01:14:31.973
<i>and grabbed my clothes</i>
<i>and belongings, and I just ran.</i>

1452
01:14:32.006 --> 01:14:34.175
<i>I ran down the street.</i>

1453
01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:38.478
<i>I've never run</i>
<i>that fast in my life.</i>

1454
01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.721
How do you feel about it now?

1455
01:14:52.626 --> 01:14:55.129
(sighs):
I...

1456
01:14:55.162 --> 01:14:57.598
I... I feel like

1457
01:14:57.631 --> 01:15:01.869
it dictated a certain direction
my life took.

1458
01:15:01.902 --> 01:15:05.740
That-- I just felt that it was
this huge e-error of judgment

1459
01:15:05.773 --> 01:15:09.577
that sort of marked me
and all my decisions.

1460
01:15:10.344 --> 01:15:11.979
And...

1461
01:15:13.714 --> 01:15:16.517
...I felt such shame...

1462
01:15:18.119 --> 01:15:21.822
...that I let him do that.

1463
01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:26.927
Did you think that he had done
the same to other girls?

1464
01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:29.663
I thought that
he must've tried it.

1465
01:15:31.332 --> 01:15:33.934
(voice breaking):
But that they'd all s...

1466
01:15:35.336 --> 01:15:37.738
...they'd all said no.

1467
01:15:41.075 --> 01:15:44.912
It was like he t-took
my voice that day.

1468
01:15:46.947 --> 01:15:51.919
Just when I was
about to start finding it.

1469
01:15:51.952 --> 01:15:53.654
(sniffles)

1470
01:15:54.722 --> 01:15:56.957
-(phones ringing)
-(busy TV and office chatter)

1471
01:16:00.094 --> 01:16:01.595
DEAN:
Yes?

1472
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:02.663
WOMAN (over phone):
I have Harvey Weinstein

1473
01:16:02.696 --> 01:16:04.698
on the phone for you.

1474
01:16:04.732 --> 01:16:06.967
DEAN:
Put him through. Thank you.

1475
01:16:08.869 --> 01:16:10.971
HARVEY: Dean, how are you?
This is Harvey.

1476
01:16:11.005 --> 01:16:13.774
Hi, Harvey.
What can I do for you?

1477
01:16:13.808 --> 01:16:16.777
If I hadn't made movies,
I would've been a journalist.

1478
01:16:17.845 --> 01:16:20.347
Dean, I heard someone was
working on a story about me.

1479
01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:23.084
Yes. If you'd like to talk
to the reporters on the record,

1480
01:16:23.117 --> 01:16:25.686
-they'd welcome that.
-I want to talk to you, Dean.

1481
01:16:25.719 --> 01:16:27.822
Well, talk to my reporters
about your concerns.

1482
01:16:27.855 --> 01:16:30.091
I'm sorry. I have work to do.

1483
01:16:30.124 --> 01:16:31.358
Are you gonna hang up?

1484
01:16:31.392 --> 01:16:33.961
Unless you have
anything else to say.

1485
01:16:33.994 --> 01:16:35.763
I love the truth.

1486
01:16:35.796 --> 01:16:38.299
People make up stories a lot.

1487
01:16:38.332 --> 01:16:39.800
Be careful of that.

1488
01:16:39.834 --> 01:16:42.036
That's fine, Harvey. Goodbye.

1489
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:45.673
♪ ♪

1490
01:16:58.252 --> 01:16:59.954
-Hi, Chanel.
-Hey, Dean.

1491
01:16:59.987 --> 01:17:01.655
Hey, Tim.

1492
01:17:07.027 --> 01:17:09.930
-Matt, you got a minute?
-Yeah.

1493
01:17:09.964 --> 01:17:11.765
DEAN:
<i>So, what do we have?</i>

1494
01:17:11.799 --> 01:17:14.368
Well, the biggest thing is
the documents that Jodi got

1495
01:17:14.401 --> 01:17:16.137
from Zelda Perkins in London.

1496
01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:18.038
Rose is still off the record,

1497
01:17:18.072 --> 01:17:21.208
but she has given us permission
to write about her settlement.

1498
01:17:21.242 --> 01:17:23.744
We're just trying to figure out
a way to confirm it.

1499
01:17:23.777 --> 01:17:25.946
Harvey offered her
a million dollars recently

1500
01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.282
for her silence.

1501
01:17:28.315 --> 01:17:30.017
-And?
-Rose refused,

1502
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:31.752
but she doesn't want us
to quote her.

1503
01:17:31.785 --> 01:17:33.354
There are still
no on-the-record sources.

1504
01:17:33.387 --> 01:17:34.755
NDAs are a problem.

1505
01:17:34.788 --> 01:17:37.024
MEGAN:
Laura Madden didn't sign one.

1506
01:17:37.057 --> 01:17:39.894
She's the only ex-assistant who
is technically free to speak.

1507
01:17:39.927 --> 01:17:41.762
Ashley and Gwyneth
didn't sign one either,

1508
01:17:41.795 --> 01:17:43.097
but they're not ready
to go on the record.

1509
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:45.099
But Laura Madden
has to deal with something

1510
01:17:45.132 --> 01:17:47.768
-very different right now.
-She has breast cancer.

1511
01:17:47.801 --> 01:17:50.738
She has to go into surgery,
so it's not likely.

1512
01:17:50.771 --> 01:17:52.439
I'm still leaving messages
for Rowena Chiu,

1513
01:17:52.473 --> 01:17:54.875
but there's no engagement.

1514
01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:56.210
So, no more proven settlements.

1515
01:17:56.243 --> 01:17:59.146
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez
almost certainly settled.

1516
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.448
And John Schmidt confirmed
that Miramax settled

1517
01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:03.117
with the woman
I visited in Queens.

1518
01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.186
Anything more on the article
from <i>The New Yorker?</i>

1519
01:18:05.219 --> 01:18:06.820
No.

1520
01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:10.357
Lanny Davis and David Boies
want to come talk to us.

1521
01:18:10.391 --> 01:18:11.992
What do you think?

1522
01:18:12.026 --> 01:18:13.994
Don't we want to wait
and push for

1523
01:18:14.028 --> 01:18:16.096
an on-the-record interview
with Weinstein?

1524
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.897
It's your call, Binky.

1525
01:18:16.931 --> 01:18:19.934
I'd like to talk to Lanny
at least.

1526
01:18:19.967 --> 01:18:21.769
See what he has to say.

1527
01:18:21.802 --> 01:18:23.470
LANNY: <i>Harvey's not</i>
<i>always that rational.</i>

1528
01:18:23.505 --> 01:18:25.739
<i>The reason I'm here</i>
<i>as his representative</i>

1529
01:18:25.773 --> 01:18:27.208
<i>is not to try to kill anything.</i>

1530
01:18:27.241 --> 01:18:29.376
<i>I want to know that</i>
<i>if you're including something</i>

1531
01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:32.746
<i>like Rósa McGowan's claim,</i>
<i>then we can defend that.</i>

1532
01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.148
REBECCA:
<i>Of course.</i>

1533
01:18:34.181 --> 01:18:35.950
Please.

1534
01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:43.224
I know you'll be investigating
with due diligence.

1535
01:18:43.257 --> 01:18:44.425
-Lanny...
-Mm-hmm?

1536
01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:46.160
...you'll have
every chance to respond.

1537
01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:48.362
Oh. Uh...

1538
01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:50.231
And I trust
it's okay to record this?

1539
01:18:50.264 --> 01:18:52.399
Oh, of course. Sure.

1540
01:18:52.433 --> 01:18:56.170
I don't expect you to name
sources, but if it's possible

1541
01:18:56.203 --> 01:18:59.541
for you to let me know overall
what your story's about?

1542
01:18:59.574 --> 01:19:02.243
We're looking into
problematic behavior

1543
01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:04.144
towards women by Weinstein.

1544
01:19:05.012 --> 01:19:07.381
Okay. (inhales deeply)

1545
01:19:07.414 --> 01:19:11.385
Harvey adamantly denies any
allegation of rape or assault.

1546
01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:13.120
Nothing criminal.

1547
01:19:13.153 --> 01:19:17.358
But he is aware of complaints
about his treatment of women,

1548
01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:19.927
and he is working on that.

1549
01:19:20.595 --> 01:19:23.931
Powerful men
of an older generation

1550
01:19:23.964 --> 01:19:25.266
are changing their understanding

1551
01:19:25.299 --> 01:19:27.401
of the meaning of the word
"consensual."

1552
01:19:27.434 --> 01:19:29.403
Why women don't feel
it's consensual

1553
01:19:29.436 --> 01:19:32.273
even if a man
convinces himself it is.

1554
01:19:32.306 --> 01:19:34.808
Do you want to expand on that?

1555
01:19:34.842 --> 01:19:37.278
Uh, I believe (chuckles)

1556
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:40.548
there's a story to be told
about the evolution of men.

1557
01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:43.083
And, in particular, Harvey
on this subject.

1558
01:19:43.117 --> 01:19:45.886
Uh, would he be willing
to talk to us about it?

1559
01:19:45.919 --> 01:19:48.088
On the record.

1560
01:19:49.089 --> 01:19:51.492
He has to deal with
his wife and children

1561
01:19:51.526 --> 01:19:53.060
before anything else.

1562
01:19:54.028 --> 01:19:59.166
You're adamant Rose McGowan's
rape accusation is false.

1563
01:19:59.199 --> 01:20:00.968
Why is that?

1564
01:20:01.001 --> 01:20:02.570
Did she tell anybody right away?

1565
01:20:02.604 --> 01:20:04.138
Did she show
any signs of distress?

1566
01:20:04.171 --> 01:20:07.141
She told her manager
and a lawyer.

1567
01:20:09.143 --> 01:20:11.912
Harvey was aware that
there was a problem with Rose,

1568
01:20:11.945 --> 01:20:14.315
but not that
she was accusing him of rape.

1569
01:20:14.348 --> 01:20:16.984
So I draw a bright line
on the word "rape."

1570
01:20:17.017 --> 01:20:19.320
Anything below that line,

1571
01:20:19.353 --> 01:20:22.389
uh, he was aware of
feelings, concerns.

1572
01:20:22.423 --> 01:20:23.924
Of what kind?

1573
01:20:23.957 --> 01:20:25.192
I'm sorry. What...

1574
01:20:25.225 --> 01:20:27.461
If the concerns
were not about rape,

1575
01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:29.363
what were they about?

1576
01:20:31.198 --> 01:20:34.234
The only way I can answer
is, um...

1577
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:37.204
...a sense of exploitation

1578
01:20:37.237 --> 01:20:41.475
because of that
disparate power relationship.

1579
01:20:41.509 --> 01:20:45.613
There's mental coercion
that isn't physical coercion.

1580
01:20:45.647 --> 01:20:48.115
Lisa Bloom has been
working with Harvey

1581
01:20:48.148 --> 01:20:49.651
to help him
recognize the difference.

1582
01:20:49.684 --> 01:20:51.185
Lisa Bloom?

1583
01:20:51.218 --> 01:20:53.020
Yeah.

1584
01:20:53.053 --> 01:20:55.489
MEGAN:
If Harvey had been made aware

1585
01:20:55.523 --> 01:21:00.861
of McGowan's concerns
at the time, how did he respond?

1586
01:21:02.062 --> 01:21:04.298
I think he had dealings legally
with her about them.

1587
01:21:04.331 --> 01:21:08.969
And how would you characterize
those legal dealings?

1588
01:21:10.505 --> 01:21:12.172
I think he became aware that

1589
01:21:12.206 --> 01:21:14.942
she did not regard
what happened as okay with her.

1590
01:21:14.975 --> 01:21:16.377
I'm not talking about rape.

1591
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:20.615
I'm talking about the effect
he had on Rose McGowan.

1592
01:21:20.648 --> 01:21:23.283
And that rather than fighting...

1593
01:21:24.084 --> 01:21:25.587
"Rather than fighting"?

1594
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.022
Then... then what?

1595
01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:34.395
I-I think he has agreed
to settlements

1596
01:21:34.428 --> 01:21:37.164
rather than litigating
what might have been litigated.

1597
01:21:37.197 --> 01:21:40.200
As Harvey saw it,
it was better to settle,

1598
01:21:40.234 --> 01:21:42.069
even if you haven't done
anything wrong.

1599
01:21:42.102 --> 01:21:44.304
He preferred to settle.

1600
01:21:46.039 --> 01:21:49.309
Were there other cases of
questionable intimate relations

1601
01:21:49.343 --> 01:21:52.045
with women
in which Weinstein settled?

1602
01:21:54.248 --> 01:21:58.018
Let's say for now,
even on a background basis,

1603
01:21:58.051 --> 01:22:00.387
that I need to find out
what my limits are legally.

1604
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:04.291
Even if on background,
I'm confirming settlements.

1605
01:22:04.324 --> 01:22:09.062
But the-the answer is yes,
there have been.

1606
01:22:11.599 --> 01:22:13.934
How many?

1607
01:22:15.469 --> 01:22:17.104
(softly):
No.

1608
01:22:17.705 --> 01:22:19.507
(Lanny chuckles)

1609
01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:23.143
To admit to settlements this
early, they're in real trouble.

1610
01:22:23.177 --> 01:22:24.978
-We need to find out a number.
-(Megan chuckles)

1611
01:22:25.012 --> 01:22:26.514
We need to corroborate each one.

1612
01:22:26.548 --> 01:22:28.348
-I'm on it.
-(phone vibrating)

1613
01:22:28.382 --> 01:22:32.319
Have you guys had any dealings
with Diana Filip?

1614
01:22:32.352 --> 01:22:34.421
-No. -I said no to speaking
at a women's conference.

1615
01:22:34.455 --> 01:22:37.592
-She just keeps on calling me.
-Did you have her checked out?

1616
01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:39.259
Security consultant says
she's legit,

1617
01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:41.428
but who has time
for these random people?

1618
01:22:43.565 --> 01:22:45.966
(phone vibrating)

1619
01:22:54.676 --> 01:22:56.143
Hello?

1620
01:22:56.176 --> 01:22:57.478
WOMAN (over phone):
I worked at Miramax.

1621
01:22:57.512 --> 01:22:59.714
Talk to Irwin Reiter.
He hates Weinstein.

1622
01:22:59.747 --> 01:23:01.248
(line clicks)

1623
01:23:05.787 --> 01:23:08.155
(phone vibrating)

1624
01:23:11.391 --> 01:23:13.060
Hey. Are you okay?

1625
01:23:13.093 --> 01:23:15.697
JODI (over phone):
Did I wake you?

1626
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:18.365
Um, yeah. What's up?

1627
01:23:18.398 --> 01:23:21.603
JODI: What do you know
about Irwin Reiter?

1628
01:23:22.804 --> 01:23:26.106
Hang on.
I put together a file on him.

1629
01:23:26.139 --> 01:23:29.309
I need to write
a good fucking email.

1630
01:23:41.188 --> 01:23:43.791
Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

1631
01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:45.627
You want to get me killed?

1632
01:23:53.166 --> 01:23:57.505
So, Irwin, you've been an
accountant for the Weinsteins

1633
01:23:57.539 --> 01:23:59.306
for 30 years.

1634
01:24:00.742 --> 01:24:02.142
(pours drink)

1635
01:24:02.175 --> 01:24:03.611
I pick up the check,

1636
01:24:03.645 --> 01:24:05.580
and I reserve the right
to leave after five minutes.

1637
01:24:05.613 --> 01:24:06.714
(clears throat)

1638
01:24:06.748 --> 01:24:10.183
So, um...
what do you want to know?

1639
01:24:10.217 --> 01:24:12.554
We have information
on several settlements

1640
01:24:12.587 --> 01:24:14.288
that Weinstein made in the '90s,

1641
01:24:14.321 --> 01:24:17.124
paid to actresses
and ex-employees.

1642
01:24:17.157 --> 01:24:20.327
Could you tell me anything
about that?

1643
01:24:22.396 --> 01:24:24.699
Could you confirm
those settlements

1644
01:24:24.732 --> 01:24:26.400
and how it was
from your perspective?

1645
01:24:26.433 --> 01:24:28.335
My perspective?

1646
01:24:29.336 --> 01:24:31.639
Would it be company money
that was used?

1647
01:24:33.273 --> 01:24:36.611
You wrote that we're from
the same tiny world.

1648
01:24:36.644 --> 01:24:37.845
Yeah.

1649
01:24:37.879 --> 01:24:40.113
Summers at bungalows
in the Catskills.

1650
01:24:40.147 --> 01:24:42.617
Meals at Lefty's and Pop-Ins.

1651
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:45.620
What do you remember
about those holidays?

1652
01:24:45.653 --> 01:24:48.856
Gosh, I remember so many things.

1653
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:50.692
It's the first time
I remember seeing

1654
01:24:50.725 --> 01:24:52.894
my grandmother's arms bare.

1655
01:24:52.927 --> 01:24:57.632
I knew those tattoos meant
something seismic.

1656
01:24:57.665 --> 01:24:59.534
Yeah, h-how did you know?

1657
01:24:59.567 --> 01:25:00.802
I just sensed it.

1658
01:25:00.835 --> 01:25:04.104
Did your family discuss it?

1659
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.844
Who else are you talking to?

1660
01:25:09.877 --> 01:25:12.312
I can't disclose that, Irwin.

1661
01:25:14.448 --> 01:25:17.652
You know, my parents,
uh, they couldn't go there.

1662
01:25:17.685 --> 01:25:20.220
They rarely discussed it.

1663
01:25:21.388 --> 01:25:23.524
It's so mysterious, isn't it?

1664
01:25:24.324 --> 01:25:26.628
Why some families talk.

1665
01:25:26.661 --> 01:25:28.362
Some don't.

1666
01:25:29.797 --> 01:25:34.836
The money Weinstein was
spending was, you know, crazy.

1667
01:25:34.869 --> 01:25:35.870
I tried.

1668
01:25:35.903 --> 01:25:37.605
I tried many times to

1669
01:25:37.639 --> 01:25:40.575
get the board to do something
about him, but they just kept

1670
01:25:40.608 --> 01:25:43.176
ignoring his behavior
and keeping him on.

1671
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:45.345
Why is that?

1672
01:25:46.279 --> 01:25:49.182
Have you talked to L.O.C.?

1673
01:25:49.216 --> 01:25:51.552
Or, uh, Z.P.?

1674
01:25:51.586 --> 01:25:53.755
Who is L.O.C.?

1675
01:25:53.788 --> 01:25:55.923
There was this memo.

1676
01:25:55.957 --> 01:25:58.960
Let me ask you something, Jodi,
that's really puzzling me.

1677
01:25:58.993 --> 01:26:01.763
Why are you asking
about the '90s

1678
01:26:01.796 --> 01:26:05.600
when Weinstein has committed
so many more recent offenses?

1679
01:26:06.901 --> 01:26:09.403
I got to go.

1680
01:26:09.436 --> 01:26:11.673
-I'll give you a call.
-Irwin.

1681
01:26:15.743 --> 01:26:18.178
♪ ♪

1682
01:26:35.863 --> 01:26:39.266
(breathes deeply)

1683
01:26:42.904 --> 01:26:44.706
(door opens)

1684
01:26:44.739 --> 01:26:46.708
(crying):
Mom.

1685
01:26:46.741 --> 01:26:48.442
I had a nightmare.

1686
01:26:48.475 --> 01:26:51.579
-Oh, honey, come here.
-(sobs)

1687
01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:57.018
-(crying softly)
-(shushing)

1688
01:26:57.051 --> 01:26:59.453
(whispering):
It's okay. It's okay.

1689
01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:01.288
I heard that
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez

1690
01:27:01.321 --> 01:27:03.423
just got
a seven-figure settlement.

1691
01:27:03.457 --> 01:27:07.427
And that Weinstein now owns
the audio of the incident?

1692
01:27:08.763 --> 01:27:11.733
These settlements, Lanny...

1693
01:27:11.766 --> 01:27:13.366
what are we talking?

1694
01:27:14.535 --> 01:27:16.804
I can't tell you that, Megan.

1695
01:27:16.838 --> 01:27:18.338
You know that.

1696
01:27:18.371 --> 01:27:19.941
I'm not talking about
naming you, of course.

1697
01:27:19.974 --> 01:27:23.644
It would just be great
for background

1698
01:27:23.678 --> 01:27:25.012
to know a number

1699
01:27:25.046 --> 01:27:27.782
of the other settlements
that you're aware of.

1700
01:27:28.649 --> 01:27:30.885
-I'm not a bad guy here.
-I know that.

1701
01:27:30.918 --> 01:27:33.420
My profession is
to get the facts

1702
01:27:33.453 --> 01:27:36.289
into the hands
of reporters, but...

1703
01:27:36.323 --> 01:27:39.259
(laughs):
you know, I can't help.

1704
01:27:41.796 --> 01:27:44.599
I keep getting 40 in my head.

1705
01:27:44.632 --> 01:27:45.666
(sighs)

1706
01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.536
Which would be
ridiculous, right?

1707
01:27:50.938 --> 01:27:52.673
Right?

1708
01:27:52.707 --> 01:27:54.407
(smacks lips)

1709
01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:57.310
It's not 40.

1710
01:27:59.547 --> 01:28:03.383
Seriously, it's-it's,
uh, less than 40.

1711
01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:05.385
Good. That's a relief.

1712
01:28:05.418 --> 01:28:06.888
-(scoffs): Sure.
-(laughs)

1713
01:28:08.823 --> 01:28:10.825
So...

1714
01:28:11.826 --> 01:28:15.663
...less than half of 40, then?

1715
01:28:15.696 --> 01:28:16.597
Check.

1716
01:28:16.631 --> 01:28:18.398
Oh, and what the fuck, Lanny?

1717
01:28:18.431 --> 01:28:20.668
We heard that Ronan Farrow
is working on a story.

1718
01:28:20.701 --> 01:28:21.736
No, no.

1719
01:28:21.769 --> 01:28:24.639
That is done. Over.

1720
01:28:26.107 --> 01:28:28.743
I don't see you
as a bad guy, Lanny.

1721
01:28:29.677 --> 01:28:32.046
I-I don't. I never have.
I respect you.

1722
01:28:32.079 --> 01:28:33.781
Uh, I respect you.

1723
01:28:36.617 --> 01:28:38.686
(sighs)

1724
01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:41.856
This is all
gonna come out, Lanny.

1725
01:28:41.889 --> 01:28:43.891
Publicly.

1726
01:28:43.925 --> 01:28:45.358
Generally does.

1727
01:28:45.392 --> 01:28:47.460
(chuckles)

1728
01:28:47.494 --> 01:28:49.597
-(laughs): Okay.
-(laughing)

1729
01:28:51.431 --> 01:28:54.068
Wh... What am I laughing about?

1730
01:28:54.101 --> 01:28:55.970
(both laugh)

1731
01:28:56.003 --> 01:28:59.472
(sighs):
Oh, Megan.

1732
01:29:00.608 --> 01:29:01.742
Lanny.

1733
01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:12.653
I'd say eight to 12 settlements.

1734
01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:20.360
(sighs softly)

1735
01:29:25.566 --> 01:29:28.502
And do you think that's normal?

1736
01:29:28.536 --> 01:29:30.638
For men to make so many payoffs?

1737
01:29:35.877 --> 01:29:38.679
I do. Yeah.

1746
01:30:03.671 --> 01:30:07.041

slowed down, let alone stopped.

1747

1750

1752

not just in me but in...

1753
01:30:27.962 --> 01:30:31.599
but in all w-women I talked to,
if it just...

1754
01:30:31.632 --> 01:30:33.935
this darkness,
this constant violence,

1755
01:30:33.968 --> 01:30:36.704

1756
01:30:37.805 --> 01:30:42.442

(smacks lips)

1763
01:31:15.743 --> 01:31:19.246
It was, uh,
from an ex-executive,

1764
01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.115
and it was extensive, scathing.

1765
01:31:21.148 --> 01:31:22.717
She sent it to the board.

1769

1770
01:31:31.692 --> 01:31:33.961
That the company was
a toxic environment.

1780

1797
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.334
I'm in New York.

1798
01:32:47.368 --> 01:32:49.703

1799
01:32:50.371 --> 01:32:52.640
ROWENA:
I couldn't tell anyone.

1800
01:32:52.673 --> 01:32:55.943
Not my parents,
not even my husband.

1801
01:32:55.976 --> 01:32:57.778
Why not?

1802
01:32:58.846 --> 01:33:01.248
I grew up
in an immigrant household.

1803
01:33:01.282 --> 01:33:03.884
I was taught
to keep my head down,

1804
01:33:03.918 --> 01:33:07.955
work hard and not draw
attention to myself, you know?

1805
01:33:07.988 --> 01:33:09.023
In Chinese culture,

1806
01:33:09.056 --> 01:33:13.127
I felt I had to protect
my family at all costs.

1807
01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:16.797
And I was young, scared.

1808
01:33:19.066 --> 01:33:22.636
Can you tell me anything about
what happened in Venice?

1809
01:33:24.839 --> 01:33:27.808
This is off the record, yeah?

1810
01:33:31.345 --> 01:33:32.947
I had the evening shifts,

1811
01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:36.050
going through notes
on screenplays with Harvey.

1812
01:33:36.083 --> 01:33:42.123
One night, we were working,
and he kept trying to touch me.

1813
01:33:42.156 --> 01:33:44.125
I didn't want to make him angry.

1814
01:33:44.158 --> 01:33:47.695
He's a very big man.

1815
01:33:47.728 --> 01:33:49.897
I kept trying
to get back to the notes.

1816
01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:53.167
And that went on
for a few hours,

1817
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.136
just trying to avoid him.

1818
01:33:55.169 --> 01:33:57.238
How did you do that?

1819
01:33:58.372 --> 01:34:01.242
I would just fight him off.

1820
01:34:02.376 --> 01:34:04.345
I'd worn two pairs of tights

1821
01:34:04.378 --> 01:34:08.349
to buy me some time
if I ever needed it.

1822
01:34:08.382 --> 01:34:11.218
But finally,

1823
01:34:11.252 --> 01:34:14.455
he held me down.

1824
01:34:14.488 --> 01:34:18.692
Not forcefully,
but like it was a game.

1825
01:34:18.726 --> 01:34:19.827
(stammers softly)

1826
01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:24.131
Then he parted my legs,

1827
01:34:24.165 --> 01:34:26.167
and he said...

1828
01:34:27.234 --> 01:34:31.705
"Please, just one thrust,
and it'll all be over."

1829
01:34:35.442 --> 01:34:36.844
I got away.

1830
01:34:36.877 --> 01:34:38.779
I was traumatized.

1831
01:34:38.812 --> 01:34:40.047
I was a Christian.

1832
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.883
I was still
with my first boyfriend.

1833
01:34:42.917 --> 01:34:45.286
And you shared this with Zelda?

1834
01:34:45.319 --> 01:34:51.025
Zelda was completely enraged
and very brave in facing him.

1835
01:34:51.058 --> 01:34:52.293
We both resigned.

1836
01:34:52.326 --> 01:34:54.228
(inhales deeply)

1837
01:34:54.261 --> 01:34:57.731
But I couldn't get a new job
after leaving Miramax. (sighs)

1838
01:34:57.765 --> 01:34:59.501
Everyone kept saying,
if I worked for Harvey,

1839
01:34:59.534 --> 01:35:01.035
why would I leave?

1840
01:35:02.369 --> 01:35:05.039

1841
01:35:05.072 --> 01:35:07.341
it stipulated that
if I ever had trouble

1842
01:35:07.374 --> 01:35:11.245
getting a job in film again,
I was to go back to Harvey

1843
01:35:11.278 --> 01:35:13.814
or his lawyer Hutensky for help.

1844
01:35:14.415 --> 01:35:17.785
I asked them for a reference,

1845
01:35:17.818 --> 01:35:22.056
and Hutensky,

You've got the story.

1916
01:40:33.568 --> 01:40:35.302
Once we publish,
everything else will come out.

1917
01:40:35.335 --> 01:40:37.137
And talk to Lauren O'Connor.

1918
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:39.106
-Yeah. -DEAN: Get ahold of
the Weinstein Company board

1919
01:40:39.139 --> 01:40:40.173
for their response.

1920
01:40:40.207 --> 01:40:41.676
Let me call Lance Maerov.

1921
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:44.077
Write it. Let's get ready.

NICOLE:
<i>My client is here,</i>

1926
01:40:55.222 --> 01:40:57.157
<i>but she's too upset to speak.</i>

1927
01:40:57.190 --> 01:40:58.826
REBECCA:
<i>Lauren, I'm sorry</i>

1928
01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:00.294
this is difficult for you.

1929
01:41:00.327 --> 01:41:02.195
We're not gonna publish
the whole memo.

1930
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:04.398
And we will make it
absolutely clear

1931
01:41:04.431 --> 01:41:07.669
you were not the source and
that you declined to comment.

1932
01:41:07.702 --> 01:41:11.171
But we do intend to use
your name for its credibility.

1933
01:41:11.204 --> 01:41:13.373
If you were
a victim of sexual assault,

1934
01:41:13.407 --> 01:41:16.243
we would absolutely keep
your anonymity.

1935
01:41:16.276 --> 01:41:18.278
But as a witness
to what went on,

1936
01:41:18.312 --> 01:41:21.549
it would make this story
much stronger to name you.

1937
01:41:21.583 --> 01:41:24.519
Hi, Lance. This is Megan Twohey
from <i>The New York Times.</i>

1938
01:41:24.552 --> 01:41:26.621
We have a memo here
from Lauren O'Connor

1939
01:41:26.654 --> 01:41:27.855
to The Weinstein Company.

1940
01:41:27.889 --> 01:41:29.456
-What? Sh...
-MEGAN: We want to know,

1941
01:41:29.489 --> 01:41:31.124
-what did you do about it?
-Shit.

1942
01:41:31.158 --> 01:41:33.528
What did the board do about it?

1943
01:41:34.494 --> 01:41:36.631
(breathing heavily)

1944
01:41:38.465 --> 01:41:40.233
Lance?

1945
01:41:40.267 --> 01:41:41.468
We did try to change things

1946
01:41:41.502 --> 01:41:43.738
with the police complaint
in 2015.

1947
01:41:43.771 --> 01:41:45.172
What about this memo?

1948
01:41:45.205 --> 01:41:46.507
It was there
and then it was gone?

1949
01:41:46.541 --> 01:41:50.177
Look, we were all worried
about Harvey's behavior.

1950
01:41:50.210 --> 01:41:52.346
Can I quote you, Lance?

1951
01:41:54.916 --> 01:41:58.352
Yes. Yes, you can.

1952
01:41:58.385 --> 01:42:01.121
So, Lauren's complaint?

1953
01:42:03.825 --> 01:42:07.361
It was withdrawn
days after it was sent.

1954
01:42:07.394 --> 01:42:08.630
So, yeah, I let it go.

1955
01:42:08.663 --> 01:42:11.532
Well, why do you think
it was withdrawn?

1956
01:42:11.566 --> 01:42:13.768
I really don't know why.

1957
01:42:13.801 --> 01:42:16.771
Look, are you sure that
this isn't just young women

1958
01:42:16.804 --> 01:42:21.241
who want to sleep with a movie
producer to try to get ahead?

1959
01:42:21.274 --> 01:42:23.377
We have decades of allegations,

1960
01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:26.781
accusations of
harassment, assault,

1961
01:42:26.814 --> 01:42:29.449
rape and multiple settlements.

1962
01:42:31.686 --> 01:42:33.655
I know you're gonna need
to speak to the board,

1963
01:42:33.688 --> 01:42:36.658
but could you wait
until after the weekend?

1964
01:42:36.691 --> 01:42:38.926
Is that possible?

1965
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.561
(clears throat)

1966
01:42:41.529 --> 01:42:43.397
Okay.

1967
01:42:51.606 --> 01:42:54.709
Ashley, I know that
ideally a lot of women

1968
01:42:54.742 --> 01:42:58.946
would be jumping together,
but that's not what's happening.

1969
01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:01.616
But we do have
a series of incidents

1970
01:43:01.649 --> 01:43:03.551
and a predatory pattern.

1971
01:43:03.584 --> 01:43:05.485
You would be
coming forward alone,

1972
01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.790
but you would be standing
on a mountain of evidence.

1973
01:43:12.459 --> 01:43:13.594
Ashley?

1974
01:43:13.628 --> 01:43:17.765
ASHLEY: Yes. I'll think
about it very seriously, Jodi.

1975
01:43:17.799 --> 01:43:18.966
I promise.

1976
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.868

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:28.743
I know we need to be mindful
of <i>The New Yorker,</i>

1980
01:43:28.776 --> 01:43:30.611
but couldn't we wait
just a little longer,

1981
01:43:30.645 --> 01:43:32.647
just-just for these women
to commit?

1982
01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.347
No. We need to publish.

1983
01:43:34.381 --> 01:43:35.750
It's nothing like
the whole story.

1984
01:43:35.783 --> 01:43:37.585
This can be the first arrow.

1985
01:43:37.618 --> 01:43:39.419
More women will come forward
afterwards.

1986
01:43:39.453 --> 01:43:42.523
It could be
so much stronger, Dean.

1987
01:43:42.557 --> 01:43:44.726
It's solid.

1988
01:43:44.759 --> 01:43:46.359
We need to go.

Weinstein to respond?

-24 hours?
-I'd double it.

1991
01:43:52.499 --> 01:43:53.534
48 hours.

1992
01:43:53.568 --> 01:43:55.603
-That's fair.
-DEAN: Two days?

Harvey and his team talk to

1994
01:43:58.005 --> 01:43:59.774

DEAN:
Good. Let's call Lanny.

and his team at 1:00 tomorrow.
