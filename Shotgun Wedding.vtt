1
00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:28.506
There she is!

2
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.510
Gloria!

3
00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:33.969
Hi.

4
00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:35.054
Welcome!

5
00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:36.806
-You look great.
-Thank you!

6
00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:39.183
-Darcy, where have you been?
-Hey! Hi!

7
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.811
I was just taking a minute.
Is that allowed?

8
00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.270
Not at your wedding.

9
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:45.856
-Your Ketel One martini.
-Oh.

10
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.566
Obrigada,  Jerome.

11
00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.569
Where is the groomzilla?

12
00:01:50.653 --> 00:01:52.571
Tom is not a groomzilla, okay?

13
00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:56.325
He just committed to making
every detail perfect.

14
00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:59.453
You should have taken your father's money
for this wedding.

15
00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:02.957
Then, professionals would make
everything  perfecto  for you.

16
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.750
Mom, I've told you. We are adults

17
00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:08.671
and we wanted to pay for our own wedding
so it could be what we wanted.

18
00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:11.257
And this is what you wanted?

19
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.050
That was a printing error.

Anyone that you adore ♪

21
00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:28.482

25
00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.711
-Hoy!

26
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:49.837
Oh! Oh!

27
00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.050
Oh! Hey!

28
00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:57.177
Oh, I almost shoot you!

29
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:59.346
I thought you're a pirate
but you're just a guy.

30
00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:05.352
Ah, this is for your bride, huh?

31
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.355
Yeah, trying to surprise her.

32
00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.858
I saw something just like it on Etsy,

33
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:14.361
and it looked perfect,
but now I'm not so sure.

34
00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.157
Now, I wanna be romantic
but not too corny.

35
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.075
There's a really fine line
between the two.

36
00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.495
Aren't you supposed to be over there?

37
00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.749
Your rehearsal party.

38
00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:27.917
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:31.545
I need you to talk
to your father's yoga teacher.

40
00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.589
-Girlfriend?
-Yeah, whatever.

41
00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.549
She keeps smiling at me.

42
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.594
Can you tell her to stop smiling at me?

43
00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:39.678
Yes, Mom.

44
00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:42.139
I will tell Dad's girlfriend
to stop smiling at you.

45
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.682
That won't cause any issues.

46
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:46.560
Also, I cannot sit at a table
with Tom's mother.

47
00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:51.231
On the boat here, she tried to start
a sing-along to  South Pacific.

48
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.108
She's excited. Okay?

49
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:55.194
She's never been out
of the country before.

50
00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:56.946
What kind of a grown woman
has never left the country?

51
00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.781
Please, Mom, for two days,
can you just get along with...

52
00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.199
Carol!

53
00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.993
♪  I'm gonna wash that man
Right outta my hair ♪

54
00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:06.455

55
00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:09.333
♪  And send him on his way ♪

56
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.587
I've been looking forward to this moment

57
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:16.131
ever since baby Tommy
was cut out of my abdomen.

58
00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:17.800
-Oh, my God,

59
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:19.969
I have never been
on a private island before.

60
00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:22.680
I've never been even on an island before.

61
00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:24.056
Actually, you know what? That's not true.

62
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.433
I went with the Heibermans.
We went to Mackinac, you know,

63
00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:28.185
before they moved to Bloomington.

64
00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.771
Have you ever been to Mackinac, Renata?

65
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.899
I don't know what that is
or most of the words you just said.

66
00:04:33.983 --> 00:04:35.985
Wouldn't she just love it, Larry?

67
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:37.403
Oh. Hi, Darcy.

68
00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:38.487
Hey, Larry.

69
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.197
I didn't see you there.

70
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.782
-Hi.
-Hi, Renata.

71
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.367
Guess what? We got you a gift.

72
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.160
-Oh, you didn't have to.
-Yes, we did.

73
00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:46.954
It's the biggest day
of our lives tomorrow.

74
00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.038
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:50.374
-Come on, open it.
-Okay.

76
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.836
-Larry, she's opening.
-I get... Oh.

77
00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.170
Ah-uh-huh.

78
00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:57.297
Oh. Someone just left that
in the bathroom.

79
00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:01.969
Oh, you're a lifesaver, Margy.

80
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.429
I cannot believe I'm late for this.

81
00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:04.805
The guests are already mingling,

82
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.933
and your Darcy is talking
to both the mothers.

83
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.479
Oh, no. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

84
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.107
Oh!

85
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:18.360
You got my daughter rusty knives?

86
00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:20.571
It's your "something borrowed."

87
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.115
Everyone in our family uses
them on their wedding day.

88
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.409
Brings you a lifetime of good luck.

89
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.618
Except for Uncle Greg

90
00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:29.413
who ended up getting
decapitated on that forklift.

91
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.248
But that's not the knife's fault.

92
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.583
Darcy!

93
00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.084
Dad!

94
00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:38.213
-Gracias.
-Mm.

95
00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:40.424
-Carol, you look lovely.

96
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.426
Mm. Mm.

97
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.219
Larry, hello, sir.

98
00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:45.512
-Hey!
-I'm gonna kiss you too.

99
00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:47.097
-Oh.
-Mm.

100
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:49.099
-Sorry. Done?
-Yeah, okay.

101
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.186
Renata.

102
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.021
Roberto.

103
00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:57.858
I love that you two are still friends.

104
00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.735
-Peekaboo!
-Oh.

105
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.111
Hi!

106
00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:03.072
Mwah. Mwah.

107
00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:05.240
Mm!

108
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.536
Oh, Darcy, I am so honored to bear witness

109
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.915
to this sacred observance
of rebirth and devotion.

110
00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.627
-Same.
-Thank you.

111
00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:19.713
Renata.

112
00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.095
I need to go to the ladies' room.

113
00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:27.596
Hey, me too.

114
00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.724
When I'm in formal wear,
I like to pee standing up. How about you?

115
00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.019
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

116
00:06:34.103 --> 00:06:35.270
Thank you, Margy.

117
00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.024
Oh, hey.

118
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.529
-Hey.
-How are you?

119
00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:47.783
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

120
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.034
-That's for you.
-Thanks.

121
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:50.452
Big  papi.

122
00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:52.454
-My man. Mwah.

123
00:06:52.538 --> 00:06:54.957
-This... I just...
-Nice to see you, Dad.

124
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.126
-Señor.
-Let's just, uh, stick

125
00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:58.544
-with "Robert" for a little while.

126
00:06:58.627 --> 00:06:59.962
-Right. Robert.
-Tom, I heard

127
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.131
you were the one who found
this incredible resort.

128
00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:04.091
-Yeah. I did.
-Yes.

129
00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.427
I actually study bioresonance,
and this place is

130
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:09.012
teeming with energetic vibrations.

131
00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:11.014
-Mm.
-It's just like

132
00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:12.975
-our room teeming with bugs.

133
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:17.354
The, uh, Four Seasons would've been nice,
but you didn't want my help, so...

134
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.438
Some things are more important

135
00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:19.565
-than money, Dad.
-Yeah.

136
00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:21.233
That's debatable.

137
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.068
Well, I need another drink.

138
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:24.361
-Yeah.

139
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.155
No, I'm good.  Gracias.

140
00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:27.489
Okay, well...

141
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.366
I'm fine.

142
00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.911
Is he ever gonna like me?

143
00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:36.123
Yes, if you just chill out
and start acting like yourself.

144
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.126
God, our families are a lot.

145
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.545
-What do you mean?
-And where have you been?

146
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.130
I was just finishing up a little project.

147
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.214
What'd I miss?

148
00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:46.675
Oh, well, your mom gave me cursed knives.

149
00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:49.303
And then my mom almost yelled
at my dad's girlfriend for smiling.

150
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.637
-Oh.
-Oh, also,

151
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:53.557
your cousin, Amy, asked where
she could charge her vibrator.

152
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.559
Oh, so, Cousin Amy came?

153
00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.894
She will soon.

154
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.104
-Um, what are you wearing?

155
00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:00.272
Oh, it's, uh...

156
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.607
Why is your hair all wet?

157
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.108
Oh, I... I just... I...

158
00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:05.527
You know, I went
for a little moonlight swim.

159
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.237
You fell in the water, didn't you?

160
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:09.198
Yeah, I fell in the water.

161
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:13.785
You know, it's kinda cute
how bad you are at lying.

162
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.251
Just... Just promise me...

163
00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.255
Promise me, you won't let go of my hand
for the rest of the night, okay?

164
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.465
I promise.

165
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:29.843
Ace.

166
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:33.055
Ace just put on the honeymoon playlist.
I need to change it.

167
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.182
Well, is "need" the right word?

168
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.725
-Dad, please.
-Oh, yeah.

169
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:40.854
Tommy, Tommy, I need you
for, like, five minutes.

170
00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:42.105
-What? No, no, no, no.
-It's an emergency.

171
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.607
I've been working
on my best-man speech, right,

172
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.108
and it is going really well.

173
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.527
-Hi.
-Hey.

174
00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:53.325
Dad's girlfriend just asked me
what my love language is.

175
00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:55.452
She sucks.

176
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.621
Happiest I've seen you in 20 years.

177
00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.789
-Thanks.
-Cheers.

178
00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:13.095
Dad invited your ex?

179
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.520
God! How does he just keep getting hotter?

180
00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.106
Looks like he's leading a porn safari.

181
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.066
I didn't wanna invite him,

182
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.778
but Dad insisted because
he said Bali was so close.

183
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.321
Wow. Wow, wow, wow. wow, wow.

184
00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:33.532
Dad is a messy bitch who loves the drama.

185
00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.868
Well, he never RSVP'd,
so we thought we were in the clear.

186
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:42.207
I didn't think he'd actually come.
You know, he never RSVP'd.

187
00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:45.961
No, that's a very, very cool move.
I'm really excited to meet him.

188
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.547
Oops, looks like he was in a rush

189
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.340
and forgot to button
his shirt all the way up.

190
00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:51.508
Deedee.

191
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.759
-Hey, man, how are you?
-Hey.

192
00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:54.636
Hi, Sean!

193
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.723
I am so sorry that I'm late.

194
00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.558
Your dad needed me to go to Japan
at the last minute,

195
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.685
and then, you know,
I had to charter a jet from Kyoto,

196
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.770
-just like a whole thing.
-No, it's okay. We just...

197
00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:05.272
You know, we didn't know you were coming.

198
00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.566
Your dad and I
wanted to surprise you.

199
00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.526
Look, babe, you know I wasn't
gonna miss your wedding

200
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.070
for anything in this world, right?

201
00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:13.947
-Sean, I want you to meet Tom.
-Tom.

202
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:15.699
-Oh, hey!
-Tom!

203
00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.659
-Tom, Tom, Tom.
-Sean. Yeah.

204
00:10:17.743 --> 00:10:18.785
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey, Tom.

205
00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:22.039
Man, I have been dying
to meet Deedee's ball player, man.

206
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.332
What position you play?

207
00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.167
-I'm a... Well, I...
-He's a designated hitter.

208
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.586
Uh, unfortunately,
they didn't pick up his contract,

209
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.546
so, technically, he's unemployed, but...

210
00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.923
Cut from the minors at 40.

211
00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.718
That's a tough break, Tom.
But if you stay positive,

212
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.012
you could have
a really great future in coaching.

213
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.055
You know what I mean?

214
00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:40.599
Yeah.

215
00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:42.642
That is an excellent idea.

216
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:43.852
-I think so.
-Thank you.

217
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:44.936
Yeah.

218
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.066
Is it time for dinner?

219
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:53.487
We are so very touched
that you all made the trek out here.

220
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.657
You know, we really wanted to pick a place
that was convenient for none of you.

221
00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:00.911
You know what,
I talk too much at the law firm.

222
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.998
So I am going to hand it over
to the man of the hour,

223
00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:07.417
the guy who made
this whole weekend happen,

224
00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.628
my lovely Tom.

225
00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:15.300
Thank you.

226
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.302
-Do it!
-You go, girl!

227
00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:18.387
Uh...

228
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.055
-Yeah!
-You got this.

229
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:21.932
-Right?

230
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.016
I can just wing this, right?

231
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.853
Darcy talked a lot about, uh,
her time in the Peace Corps in Bali,

232
00:11:26.937 --> 00:11:28.480
and I thought, you know,

233
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.107
how cool would it be
if we got married there.

234
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.319
And then, I realized that
Bali was un-Bali-vably expensive.

235
00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:38.365
I think the Philippines are better.

236
00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:39.699
-Right, Ace?

237
00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.369
Ace agrees. Next.

238
00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:45.247
-Aw!

239
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.541
I know a lot of you were there
to witness my proposal.

240
00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.835
The shock and surprise. Priceless.

241
00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.963
Anyway, Mom and Dad,
I just wanna say thank you.

242
00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.632
Your commitment is something
that we can only aspire to.

243
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.843
-Oh, my God.
-Robert, Renata,

244
00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:01.763
we hope our marriage is
nothing like yours.

245
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:05.642
Pivot, baby. Pivot.

246
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.104
I mean, that's not a...
a character judgment, by any means.

247
00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.898
I mean, 50% of marriages
end in divorce, right?

248
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:13.442
-Ha! Wonderful.

249
00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.901
Cheers, everybody.

250
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:16.361
-Cheers, cheers, cheers.
-Cheers.

251
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.365
Oh, my God. That did not go well.

252
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:22.159
No, that was awesome.

253
00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.831
So Deedee and I met
in the Peace Corps in Bali.

254
00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:31.585
And one day, we had to run
these medical supplies to this village.

255
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.379
I decided to teach her
how to drive the boat,

256
00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.214
so I could sleep
and she could do all the work.

257
00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.386
The first time our girl
gets behind the wheel,

258
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.431
she gets a damn speeding ticket
from the coast guard.

259
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.268
Right? Deedee doesn't do
anything half-assed.

260
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.061
She sees what she wants,

261
00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:53.482
she goes after it,
and she doesn't settle for less.

262
00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:54.566
It's true, it's true.

263
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.109
So, as some of you may know,

264
00:12:56.193 --> 00:12:59.488
Deedee and I were,
100 years ago, were engaged.

265
00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:01.781
But she called it off.

266
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.577
No. No, no, no, no.

267
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.162
She was waiting for Tom.

268
00:13:08.205 --> 00:13:12.792
And that guy right there
has gotta be a one-in-a-million supernova

269
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.628
to snag that beautiful soul.

270
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.129
-Thanks.

271
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:18.924
-Thanks, Sean.
-So, in conclusion,

272
00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.926
I just wanna say one thing to you, Deedee.

273
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.303
Katuk kak ci.

274
00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:30.685
What's...  Katuk kak  what?

275
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.771
Oh, God. Um, it's hard to explain.

276
00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.106
It actually means, um,

277
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.734
"Fuck your grandpa."
It's just...

278
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.319
Well, that's not that hard to explain.

279
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.197
Yeah, well, I don't know.
Just, in Balinese, it's super offensive.

280
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.574
Yeah, well, it's offensive everywhere, no?

281
00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:47.494
-Yeah. I mean... It just...
-"Fuck your grandpa!"

282
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.579
-It just made us laugh.
-It is funny.

283
00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:51.915
-Hi, everybody.

284
00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.042
I'm Tom's baby sister, Jeannie.

285
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.961
-Yeah, Jeannie!
-Hey, Jeannie!

286
00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.505
Wow, Sean's speech, wasn't it somethin'?

287
00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:07.597
Honey?

288
00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:13.728
Maybe we should just,
you know, call it a night.

289
00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.438
No, babe, you go ahead.

290
00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.733
I gotta finish these centerpieces
and rearrange the seating chart

291
00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.944
now that Sean decided to show up.

292
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.156
-Tom!

293
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.200
Tom!

294
00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.162
Let's have sex.

295
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.668
Yes. Yes.

296
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.837
Just... Just... Just...
Just gimme... Just...

297
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.922
I just have to finish
these pineapples real quick.

298
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:44.551
Okay. Um...

299
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:52.183
But do you really have to finish
pineapples right now?

300
00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.733
Oh, my God. I love you
in a T-shirt and no pants.

301
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.236
I'm just gonna reach over here,

302
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.615
this high shelf, so I can get
something to read.

303
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:10.160
Why is it so sexy
when you can't reach high shelves?

304
00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.332
-So, um...

305
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.875
I'm sorry, miss, but it was...

306
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:18.918
-It's this one here?
-No, no, no.

307
00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:20.128
It's the one over there.

308
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.546
-Sir, please.
-Oh, this one.

309
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.797
-This one.
-Yes.

310
00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:25.258
-That?
-Thank you, sir.

311
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.344
Okay. Glad I could help.

312
00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.193
I miss you.

313
00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.696
It's been a while, huh?

314
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.657
I know.

315
00:15:49.658 --> 00:15:50.867
I miss you.

316
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.795
Could I ask you a question?

317
00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:03.880
Is it a sexy question?

318
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.341
Um...

319
00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:10.387
Just wondering why you called off
the engagement with Sean again.

320
00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:14.182
That is so not sexy.

321
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.685
I... I told you this.

322
00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:18.687
We were young, we were in Bali,

323
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.272
and then one day, I woke up
and it just didn't feel right.

324
00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.067
-Okay?
-Okay.

325
00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:31.199
But you said yes.

326
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.077
You know, what changed your mind?

327
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.580
I don't know.

328
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.084
Uh, he... he started working with my dad,

329
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:45.672
he changed, and all he cared about
was status and money.

330
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.924
Anyway, why do you want
to talk about my ex

331
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.634
the night before our wedding?

332
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.887
I don't know. Maybe because
you invited him to our wedding?

333
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.472
Remember, I didn't.

334
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.600
My dad asked me to invite him.
What was I supposed to say?

335
00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.018
I don't know. Uh, no?

336
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.438
If you remember correctly,
I didn't wanna invite anyone.

337
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.940
-I wanted to elope.

338
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.901
The only reason I agreed
to a traditional wedding

339
00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.904
was because you said that
we'd have moments alone.

340
00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.199
Hey, hello. It's Carol.

341
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.745
Hi. Hello.

342
00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.122
Your future mother-in-law, Carol.

343
00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.332
Yep, I know your name, Carol.

344
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:24.461
I brought some of the extras
for the welcome bags

345
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.838
in case you want to make one for Sean.

346
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.339
Oh! Oh.

347
00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:29.883
Great. Thanks.

348
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:31.843
All right, thanks.

349
00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.512
Tommy, she's not wearing any pants.

350
00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.182
-I just want to ask,

351
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.100
and... and I hope it's okay.

352
00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.643
Is that genetics,

353
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:44.272
or is it, like, Pilates or something?

354
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:45.440
Mom, now is not the time for this.

355
00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.942
Yes, all right. But, you know,
we need to get you outta here.

356
00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:50.820
It's the night before your wedding,
and you can't spend the night together.

357
00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.947
-No, Ma, it's just...
-You can't. It's bad luck.

358
00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.867
You know, his cousin, Jenna,
she spent the night with her husband.

359
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.038
Lo and behold, she got Lyme disease,
and now she can't wear sandals.

360
00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.708
It's a tradition.

361
00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:08.940
Oh.
Look at the happy couple.

362
00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.655
Where have you been?

363
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.907
You were supposed to do my hair.

364
00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.285
Now birds are gonna lay eggs in it.

365
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.245
I know. I overslept. I'm sorry.

366
00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.582
Kind of, sort of,
slept with Ricky last night.

367
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.293
-Ricky?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

368
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.837
I just, I was in the mood for something,
you know, that wasn't quite right.

369
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.839
Like ordering a hamburger
at a sushi bar or something.

370
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.133
I'm just gonna avoid him today. It's fine.

371
00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.676
He's Tom's best man.

372
00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.595
You two have to walk down
the aisle together.

373
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:42.056
I am very good at ignoring people
that I'm standing next to.

374
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.600
-No kidding.
-Ready?

375
00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.894
I can't believe you agreed
to wear Carol's wedding dress.

376
00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.520
-Okay.

377
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.481
-Okay, okay.

378
00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.567
You look beautiful, no matter what.

379
00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:55.612
She's ready!

380
00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:56.654
Hey, should we all do

381
00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:57.906
-a round of tequila shots?

382
00:19:57.989 --> 00:20:01.492
Well, I Scotchgarded the dress,
so try not to inhale the chemicals.

383
00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.411
Where's the veil?
Where's the veil?

384
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:04.746
Okay.

385
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.039
Well, yes, tequila.

386
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.582
Unless we get the bottle,
I'm not set.

387
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:08.833
No, no tequila.

388
00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.168
Oh!

389
00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.670
The prettiest of them all.

390
00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:15.131
You look so much better
than the rest of us.

391
00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.967
This dress is just wonderful.

392
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.552
I wore it for my wedding,

393
00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:23.806
Jeannie wore it for hers,
and now you're gonna wear it for yours.

394
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.183
Oh, my gosh.

395
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.226
Look at you.

396
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:31.022
Oh, it's white coral made out of tissue.

397
00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:32.106
Um...

398
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:36.319
Something doesn't, you know, feel right.

399
00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:37.904
Do you think
if we blew-dried the veil,

400
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.364
-it would be more fluffy?
-Okay, so what I'm seeing is,

401
00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.531
I think that the left boob
is actually slightly lower

402
00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:42.033
-than the right boob.
-Like floof, floof, like that?

403
00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:45.620
Hey, something kinda magical
happened with me last night.

404
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.288
-Theoretically speaking...

405
00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:49.499
...would it be weird or wonderful

406
00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.459
-if we married sisters?

407
00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:52.794
Yeah, sure.

408
00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:59.050
Hey, psst, Larry.
Tom's being boring.

409
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:00.635
Come film me doing a backflip!

410
00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:02.261
Oh, I...
I don't think I should walk.

411
00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:03.388
All right.

412
00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.579
It's time.

413
00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:42.885
Wow!

414
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.471
Look at you.

415
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:54.981
Okay.

416
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.191
You wanted to talk.

417
00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:00.570
I know it's last minute.

418
00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:03.031
I just...

419
00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.702
I hated the way things ended
last night, and...

420
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.414
And I didn't want our wedding day
to start off on a bad note.

421
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:15.126
Oh, my God.

422
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.756
God, I thought you were calling it off.

423
00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.342
Calling off the wedding?

424
00:22:23.426 --> 00:22:24.594
-Why?
-Uh, I don't know.

425
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:27.638
I mean, this weekend
hasn't exactly gone to plan.

426
00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:30.516
You and I have been arguing more
in the last few months than we did

427
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.185
our first four years together.

428
00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:34.145
I don't know.
I guess I thought

429
00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:35.855
weddings were supposed to be fun.

430
00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:38.524
Oh. Okay.

431
00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:41.319
Well, I'm sorry I didn't make
your wedding more fun for you.

432
00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:43.488
Well, no. That's...
Darcy, that's not what...

433
00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:47.408
And it's not my wedding. It's our wedding.

434
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.368
Hardly.

435
00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:51.412
Yeah, Tom.

436
00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:54.832
You got so fixated
on the wedding that you...

437
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:56.542
you turned into a different person.

438
00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:58.628
I'm sorry. I just wanted
everything to be perfect.

439
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.963
Why is that so important to you?

440
00:23:01.047 --> 00:23:02.590
Why isn't it important to you?

441
00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:04.008
It's like you don't even care
about the wedding.

442
00:23:04.592 --> 00:23:06.552
Well, I... Of course I care.

443
00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:07.762
Oh, yeah?

444
00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:10.014
You're the one that insisted
that we pay for this wedding.

445
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.766
Yet I'm the one that's bargaining

446
00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:13.976
with all the vendors
and DIY-ing everything,

447
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.687
and all you're saying is,
"I don't know. It looks good,"

448
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.731
you know, "Sounds good, Tom.
Whatever you want."

449
00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:22.276
I told you that I did not want
a big traditional wedding.

450
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.696
Okay? I'm not some blushing bride.
I'm a grown woman.

451
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.032
I don't want my daddy
walking me down the aisle.

452
00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:30.118
I don't need a big princess dress,

453
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:33.371
and I certainly don't need
a wedding registry.

454
00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:36.082
I have my things already.
I like my things.

455
00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:37.792
I wanted a Roomba.

456
00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:42.839
Well, she's not up in the lobby.

457
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:44.215
I can't get through on my phone.

458
00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:46.717
Oh, my God. They've fallen in a ditch.

459
00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:48.928
What? And how do you know that?

460
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:50.012
I don't know.

461
00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:52.348
I just have a sixth sense
about these things.

462
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.683
Ace and I will take a look around.

463
00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.643
Don't worry. We will find them.

464
00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:59.147
-Check all ditches!
-God.

465
00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:05.236
I wanted it to just be you and me
in the middle of the ocean.

466
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:07.822
And for the 400th time,
that would've killed my mother.

467
00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:09.532
Ugh. Right.

468
00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:11.200
And that's why I'm in your mother's dress

469
00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:13.870
with an extra 10 pounds of hair
on my head.

470
00:24:14.704 --> 00:24:18.875
But the truth is, you have not listened
to one thing I wanted since you proposed.

471
00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:22.587
Okay, well, Darcy, I'm listening.
Enlighten me.

472
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.089
What is it? What is it that you want?

473
00:24:25.506 --> 00:24:28.885
Tom, we've... We talked about this.

474
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:33.347
I told you on our very first date,
I didn't want a big wedding.

475
00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:34.473
Well, I thought you changed

476
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.017
-your mind about that.

477
00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:38.352
Why did you even agree to do it then?

478
00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:42.899
Oh, I... I don't... I don't know!

479
00:24:42.982 --> 00:24:44.609
Okay? Because...

480
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.446
Because I love you. Because I... I w...

481
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:50.573
I wanted you to be happy.

482
00:24:51.032 --> 00:24:52.783
Go! Come on, move!

483
00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:54.952
Everybody, move! Come on!

484
00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:56.579
-Move along.

485
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:59.207
Go outside, go outside right now.
Come on. Come on.

486
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.043
If you don't wanna go through with this,

487
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.212
it's not too late.

488
00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:05.838
What?

489
00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:14.347
No. We brought everybody that we loved
down to the Philippines for our wedding.

490
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.432
I'm in this dress! We're doin' this!

491
00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.517
Oh, that was beautiful.
Are those your vows?

492
00:25:21.437 --> 00:25:22.480
Oh, my God.

493
00:25:23.898 --> 00:25:26.317
You convinced yourself
that I wanted to call off the wedding,

494
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.652
and now you're making it happen.

495
00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:30.404
Oh, there you go. Lawyering yourself
out of any real responsibility.

496
00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:37.495
You cut me with your ring!

497
00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:42.375
-Won't happen again.

498
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:50.925
Great!

499
00:25:51.676 --> 00:25:53.261
Why don't you go be with Sean?

500
00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:56.222
Maybe you guys could go bang
some grandpas!

501
00:26:05.773 --> 00:26:08.359
I don't know why.
I have a bad feeling about this.

502
00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:09.944
It's gonna be fine, honey.

503
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:12.822
I think you might be overreacting.

504
00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:19.412
Hold still!
Get down, get down, get down!

505
00:26:25.293 --> 00:26:26.502
-No running!

506
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.546
-Everyone!
-Get down.

507
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.757
To the pool! Now!

508
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:33.134
First rows, go!

509
00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:34.552
-Go, go, go!

510
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.762
Everyone, this way! This way!

511
00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:39.640
Come on! Come on! One line! Let's go!

512
00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:55.781
Let's go!

513
00:26:57.658 --> 00:26:58.951
Darcy.

514
00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:03.873
-Guys, go!
-Go, go, up there.

515
00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:06.292
Up there!
Up there! Go! Go to the end.

516
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.044
-Go, go!
-Everybody, walk!

517
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:10.421
-Keep going.
-Let's go.

518
00:27:10.504 --> 00:27:11.672
Go!

519
00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:14.508
Keep moving! There you go.

520
00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:16.093
Turn. Turn. Go!

521
00:27:16.177 --> 00:27:17.386
-Line up.
-Keep moving.

522
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.596
Line up, go!

523
00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:19.764
-Now!
-No.

524
00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:21.891
And into the pool.

525
00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.351
Now. Go!

526
00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:26.437
Go in. Faster, faster, faster.

527
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.564
-Get in the water.
-Let's go faster.

528
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:31.317
-Drop the phone.
-But my phone will get ruined.

529
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.651
I think that's the point, sweetie.
Just drop it.

530
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:33.861
Yeah, but I haven't
backed it up in a while.

531
00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:35.529
-Drop it!
-Okay. Okay.

532
00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:38.491
No need to be scared.

533
00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:41.994
As long as everybody follows directions,
no one gets hurt.

534
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.997
Raise your hand when you hear your name.

535
00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:47.458
Robert Rivera.

536
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:56.342
Robert! Robert.

537
00:27:57.134 --> 00:27:58.427
They're calling you.

538
00:27:59.887 --> 00:28:01.263
Thanks a lot, Carol.

539
00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:07.311
-Larry Fowler.
-Present.

540
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:11.941
I... I'm Carol, his wife.

541
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:13.526
Just so you don't have to make two trips.

542
00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:16.695
Wait, wait. I'd like it in the center.

543
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:21.450
Sean Hawkins.

544
00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:25.413
If you hurt anyone in this pool,
you're gonna have to answer to me.

545
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.041
Is this the hero of the group?

546
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.709
Yes.

547
00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:33.129
No. Oh, my God.

548
00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:36.966
There is always one.

549
00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:39.635
All right.

550
00:28:50.813 --> 00:28:52.565
Where is bride and groom?

551
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:55.568
She's there.
Isn't she the bride?

552
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:56.652
Oh. No.

553
00:28:56.735 --> 00:29:01.031
Amanda thought it was appropriate
to wear white to a wedding.

554
00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:02.450
I didn't know that was a rule.

555
00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:03.868
Yes, you did.

556
00:29:03.951 --> 00:29:05.870
-You're a gaslighter.
-Yeah.

557
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:07.538
You see, this is a problem.

558
00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:10.374
They could call police.
And if police come,

559
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:12.543
we kill everyone.

560
00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:14.128
-Oh, my God.

561
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:17.298
Okay, um, I... I saw Tom headed towards
the nature walk before the ceremony,

562
00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:20.551
and I noticed that his frequency levels
were dangerously low.

563
00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:22.219
I think he's getting cold feet.

564
00:29:22.303 --> 00:29:23.596
Tommy has cold feet?

565
00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.223
Is this really what we should be
worrying about at this point?

566
00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:29.518
I'm a mother. I can worry
about a lot of things at the same time.

567
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:31.520
Like Larry's mole.

568
00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:32.813
Oh, it's fine, sweetie.

569
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:34.440
-It's getting bigger.
-Spread out.

570
00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.484
-Look for them.

571
00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:44.700
Hey, uh, I... I...
I texted you this morning

572
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:46.452
and I didn't hear anything back.

573
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.413
Are you being serious right now?

574
00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:51.624
No. No.

575
00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:57.046
Darcy!

576
00:29:57.129 --> 00:30:00.090
-Darcy! Hey!

577
00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:03.511
-No, no, no, no. Darcy.

578
00:30:03.594 --> 00:30:06.055
-Darcy, I'm coming in.
-Fuck off, Tom!

579
00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:07.264
Oh, thank God.

580
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:10.851
Listen, I know you're mad at me right now,
but you have to let me in.

581
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:13.229
Why would I be mad? I'm awesome.

582
00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:15.481
I'm on a tropical island,
I'm having a liquid brunch,

583
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:17.691
and I don't have to answer to anybody!

584
00:30:20.194 --> 00:30:23.113
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

585
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:25.533
Oh, it is happening, buddy.

586
00:30:25.616 --> 00:30:29.203
Okay? And once I get this hair condo
off my head,

587
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:32.623
I'm gonna march down to that beach
and tell everybody how you blew this up!

588
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:33.832
Shh... shh!

589
00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:36.085
Are you seriously shushing me right now?

590
00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:38.295
What the fuck?

591
00:30:42.675 --> 00:30:43.676
Is that blood?

592
00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:46.053
There's no time
for a blood freak-out right now.

593
00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:48.055
-Don't tell me...

594
00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:50.849
-There are pirates outside,

595
00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:52.601
and they took everybody hostage.

596
00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:53.686
What?

597
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:13.455
-We have to get help.
-No, no. No. No.

598
00:31:14.832 --> 00:31:16.959
-The phone is dead.
-Oh, the Wi-Fi too.

599
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:19.211
Marge said the cell service
is better on the north side.

600
00:31:19.295 --> 00:31:21.130
Why did you pick an island
with no cell service?

601
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.007
Because I wanted people to be present
and in the moment.

602
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.883
-Jeez!

603
00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:28.429
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

604
00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:29.388
I know. Me neither.

605
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:32.266
No. I... I really can't breathe.
It's the shapewear.

606
00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:33.767
Please help me get out of this dress now.

607
00:31:35.185 --> 00:31:36.353
Now!

608
00:31:36.437 --> 00:31:37.563
Would you relax?

609
00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:39.106
What did you just say to me?

610
00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:40.441
I said everything's gonna be okay.

611
00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:41.942
Dress is like a riddle.

612
00:31:42.026 --> 00:31:43.485
-Oh!

613
00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:45.571
God, I'm gonna die in this dress!

614
00:31:46.989 --> 00:31:48.991
Oh, door latches from the inside.

615
00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:51.118
He's gonna know we're in here.

616
00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:54.955
He's also gonna know we're in here
when he comes in here and we're in here.

617
00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.373
He'll think we're in the shower.

618
00:31:56.457 --> 00:31:57.958
What... What?

619
00:31:58.042 --> 00:32:00.502
And come back at a better time?
Leave a note?

620
00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:02.379
-All right.

621
00:32:02.463 --> 00:32:04.882
Okay, h... here's the plan. He comes in,
he's gonna think we're in the shower,

622
00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:06.592
then I jump out and I trap him in the net.

623
00:32:06.675 --> 00:32:08.093
Oh, my God, that's an amazing plan.

624
00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:09.219
-Yes!
-No!

625
00:32:09.303 --> 00:32:10.554
You're gonna throw a net over a pirate?

626
00:32:10.638 --> 00:32:11.805
Have you ever tried to get out of a net?

627
00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:13.140
It's very hard to get out of a net.

628
00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:14.850
Okay. How about...

629
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:16.977
How about this? I spray him in the eyes.

630
00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:19.730
How is hairspray in the eyes
better than a net over his head?

631
00:32:19.813 --> 00:32:21.940
Wait! Yes, that's actually...

632
00:32:22.024 --> 00:32:24.109
That's actually... You spray that.

633
00:32:24.193 --> 00:32:26.070
I'll light the match.
It'll be like a flamethrower.

634
00:32:26.153 --> 00:32:27.404
-I mean, it won't work!
-Why?

635
00:32:27.488 --> 00:32:29.031
-Too many steps.
-It's two steps.

636
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:31.784
It's two steps. Flamethrower, net.

637
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:35.079
I pop out and I put the net over his head.
I'll surprise him.

638
00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:37.289
No, Tom, because bullets
shoot through nets!

639
00:32:37.373 --> 00:32:39.041
-Technically, yeah.
-Technically?

640
00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:40.584
Technically, he won't be able
to shoot straight

641
00:32:40.668 --> 00:32:42.961
because he'll be all fuckin'
wrapped up in the net.

642
00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:45.464
I swear to God, if you say "net"
one more time...

643
00:32:48.425 --> 00:32:50.511
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

644
00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.728
Psst. Flamethrower.

645
00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:17.121
I'm gonna fuck him up.

646
00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:18.330
I'm gonna fuck him up.

647
00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:45.899
Fuck!

648
00:33:48.485 --> 00:33:49.611
-Ow!

649
00:33:49.695 --> 00:33:51.363
-Never mind! Never mind.
-Why did you do that?

650
00:33:51.447 --> 00:33:54.116
-Never mind!

651
00:33:56.326 --> 00:33:59.538
-You were right.

652
00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:01.623
That hairspray was
so much worse than the net.

653
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:06.962
-Ow!
-Get up.

654
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.088
Okay.

655
00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:13.051
-Come on.
-Don't strangle me.

656
00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:15.262
-Turn your arm.
-I have them alive.

657
00:34:15.345 --> 00:34:16.472
Wait, wait. What?

658
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:19.183
Bungalow 15. Pick me up.

659
00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:21.810
Go collect them.

660
00:34:22.853 --> 00:34:25.022
And then we can begin.

661
00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:34.990
You doing okay, Jamie?

662
00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:39.495
My stomach feels like
it's gonna fall through my asshole.

663
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:41.371
But otherwise, I'm chill.

664
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:44.082
Listen, it's normal to feel scared.

665
00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:45.918
But I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you

666
00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:48.921
or your family. Promise.

667
00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:51.715
Hey, Sean?

668
00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:53.759
I am also feeling scared.

669
00:34:53.842 --> 00:34:55.761
Like the most scared
I've ever been in my whole life.

670
00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:58.096
It's like I just watched  The Ring,
you know?

671
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.892
Robbie, baby, I want you
to practice the breathing exercise

672
00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:04.061
that we learned at Esalen, okay?

673
00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:06.855
I'm gonna hit a pressure point.
Ready? And...

674
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.400
-Breathe. Breathe.

675
00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:12.277
From the diaphragm.

676
00:35:12.361 --> 00:35:14.404
-I think I'm gonna throw up now.
-It's okay. You're doing fine.

677
00:35:14.488 --> 00:35:18.283
If he keeps making that noise,
just go ahead and shoot me.

678
00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:22.037
The happy couple
will be here in a second.

679
00:35:22.788 --> 00:35:24.373
So let's get to business.

680
00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:26.375
Where is the father of the bride?

681
00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:32.339
Robert. He's calling ya again.

682
00:35:34.424 --> 00:35:37.261
Thanks, Carol.

683
00:35:37.678 --> 00:35:38.846
Okay, what do you want?

684
00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:44.268
Well, we call my colleague
on the satellite phone,

685
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:47.479
and you transfer $45 million
to a bank account.

686
00:35:47.563 --> 00:35:49.064
What? What?

687
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.649
I don't have that kind of money.

688
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:55.404
We googled you.
Net worth is $60 million.

689
00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:58.490
I'm not giving you anything
until I find out if my daughter's safe.

690
00:35:59.533 --> 00:36:01.743
-And your son-in-law.
-Yeah, him too.

691
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:03.537
Okay.

692
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.248
I can wait two minutes
to take all your money.

693
00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:08.000
This way.

694
00:36:10.127 --> 00:36:12.045
You want some pineapple candies?

695
00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:15.507
They're from that weird welcome bag
we got, but I found them in my pocket.

696
00:36:15.591 --> 00:36:19.094
No, I don't want loose, wet candy
from your gross pockets.

697
00:36:21.638 --> 00:36:22.764
Okay.

698
00:36:23.557 --> 00:36:24.808
Suit yourself.

699
00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:32.274
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

700
00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:33.358
-I'm starving.
-No.

701
00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:38.113
-You're an asshole.
-Hmm.

702
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:40.157
God, I can't believe
that I had sex with you.

703
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.451
Honestly, I was pretty surprised
by that too.

704
00:36:42.743 --> 00:36:45.078
My parents, they got divorced
when I was in high school,

705
00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:47.873
and my first engagement was a disaster.

706
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:50.834
What about you? Are you dating anyone?

707
00:36:50.918 --> 00:36:52.252
Have you always wanted to be a pirate?

708
00:36:52.336 --> 00:36:54.379
No more talk, lady.

709
00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.803
Excuse me, sirs.

710
00:37:01.887 --> 00:37:03.138
Darcy, they're gonna hurt you.

711
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.849
I just can't help but notice
that you guys smell like cigarettes,

712
00:37:05.933 --> 00:37:08.352
and I am loving it.

713
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:10.854
Is there any way I could bum a cigarette?

714
00:37:10.938 --> 00:37:12.397
I mean, I think it might help with the...

715
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:14.107
the panic and dread
I'm experiencing right now.

716
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:15.400
Since when do you smoke cigarettes?

717
00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:16.610
It's...

718
00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:19.613
I just... You don't even
have to untie my hands.

719
00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:21.990
I mean, I... I can smoke with no hands.

720
00:37:22.074 --> 00:37:24.409
You could just put it right in my mouth.

721
00:37:24.493 --> 00:37:25.619
Give her a cigarette.

722
00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:27.371
-Please.
-Maybe it will shut her up.

723
00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:29.247
Yes, yes, yes, it will shut me up.

724
00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:32.626
Oh, thank you.

725
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.588
You guys are the...

726
00:37:38.173 --> 00:37:39.174
best.

727
00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:40.842
-What?

728
00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:42.970
-Fire!

729
00:37:44.638 --> 00:37:46.056
Oh, my God!

730
00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:49.142
-Oh, my God! Flamethrower!

731
00:37:49.226 --> 00:37:50.352
-Oh, my...

732
00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:53.230
See, that's why you only have a plan
with one step!

733
00:37:56.108 --> 00:37:57.401
-No!
-Oh, my God!

734
00:37:57.484 --> 00:37:59.653
-Get the brakes!
-I'm trying! I'm trying!

735
00:38:07.536 --> 00:38:08.704
-Cliff!

736
00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:10.122
-Cliff! Cliff!
-I see it!

737
00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:11.540
Get it into park!

738
00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.128
-Oh, God! Oh, my God!
-God!

739
00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:20.215
Oh, slide out!

740
00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:29.391
My dress! My dress, Tom!

741
00:38:29.474 --> 00:38:30.767
Tom, don't let go!

742
00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:32.853
-Don't you let go!

743
00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:35.313
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

744
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.294
-Go!

745
00:38:57.377 --> 00:38:59.421
Go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

746
00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:07.095
Quick, do something baseball-y.

747
00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:09.222
What? This is nothing like baseball!

748
00:39:10.182 --> 00:39:11.975
-Down! Down, down!
-Fuck!

749
00:39:14.102 --> 00:39:16.855
-He's out of ammo.
-Right.

750
00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:18.356
-Run at him!
-What?

751
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:21.234
-Go. Believe me, just go!
-No, no, no!

752
00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:27.949
-Grenade!
-He has a grenade!

753
00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:29.868
Sir!

754
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:31.411
Sir, sir.

755
00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:33.080
Give me the grenade, sir. Sir!

756
00:39:33.163 --> 00:39:36.041
Sir, give me the grenade. Sir. Sir!

757
00:39:40.045 --> 00:39:42.047
-Ah-ow. Ow!

758
00:39:52.808 --> 00:39:54.601
Oh, my God.

759
00:39:54.684 --> 00:39:56.728
-Is he dead?
-I don't know.

760
00:39:57.979 --> 00:39:59.439
Are you dead?

761
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:10.367
Oh, yeah, he's very not alive.

762
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.452
Not alive. Oh, boy.

763
00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:14.454
-Yes! You killed him!
-Yeah!

764
00:40:14.538 --> 00:40:16.706
Yeah, I killed him! I killed him!

765
00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:20.460
Oh, my God, I killed a man.

766
00:40:20.544 --> 00:40:23.255
I killed a man. No.

767
00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:25.465
-How do you feel?

768
00:40:25.549 --> 00:40:27.676
I feel... Oh, my God. I feel horrible.

769
00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:30.178
-Yeah.
-But excited.

770
00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:32.347
You know, like, happy.
Like, I'm gonna shit my pants.

771
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.431
-Yeah.
-You know, like,

772
00:40:33.515 --> 00:40:34.975
but in a good way. You know?

773
00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:36.226
Huh.

774
00:40:36.643 --> 00:40:37.769
Oh, my God.

775
00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:40.147
I'm gonna go to prison.

776
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.314
-I'm gonna...
-No!

777
00:40:41.398 --> 00:40:43.066
-Yeah.
-No. It was... It...

778
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.985
It was self-defense.
He was trying to kill us.

779
00:40:45.068 --> 00:40:46.403
Any court would...

780
00:40:47.237 --> 00:40:48.363
Any court...

781
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.031
Are you okay?

782
00:40:50.115 --> 00:40:52.826
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

783
00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:55.662
It's just, you know, I looked over there
and I saw all the blood.

784
00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:57.414
And, you know, I think I saw some brain.

785
00:40:57.497 --> 00:40:59.207
-Was that brain stuff?
-Yeah. Yeah.

786
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:02.961
And so I'm just gonna look up at the sky
and... so I don't pass out.

787
00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:04.546
Okay. Well, you know what?
Maybe we should...

788
00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:06.047
-Let's just step away

789
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:07.132
from the scene.

790
00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:08.258
-And don't look down.
-Okay.

791
00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:09.342
-Okay.
-Just don't look down.

792
00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:12.429
They should be here by now.

793
00:41:12.512 --> 00:41:13.513
Head up the road.

794
00:41:13.597 --> 00:41:14.931
-Check on them.
-Yeah.

795
00:41:20.604 --> 00:41:23.857
All right. We need to get off this island.

796
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.985
Well, it might help that
I got this grenade for us.

797
00:41:27.068 --> 00:41:29.446
I mean, he was trying
to blow us up, but I got it.

798
00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:31.740
I got it. Another point for Darcy.

799
00:41:34.284 --> 00:41:35.911
Okay, Darcy.

800
00:41:35.994 --> 00:41:36.995
Uh...

801
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:39.164
Do you remember

802
00:41:39.789 --> 00:41:41.666
that time that we were
driving down the highway

803
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.794
and you very calmly told me to pull over?

804
00:41:44.878 --> 00:41:46.463
And you waited until we pulled over

805
00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:49.257
to tell me that there was
a giant spider on my head?

806
00:41:49.799 --> 00:41:51.176
Yeah. Yeah.

807
00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:52.510
Yeah, well, that was very smart.

808
00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:57.474
Because if you had told me before,
I might have panicked and crashed the car.

809
00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:58.767
Wait. Is there a spider on my head?

810
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.268
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

811
00:42:00.352 --> 00:42:02.312
No, no. I tell you this story because...

812
00:42:03.563 --> 00:42:04.648
I don't want you to panic

813
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:06.650
when I tell you
what I'm about to tell you.

814
00:42:07.651 --> 00:42:10.362
Your grenade doesn't have a pin.

815
00:42:14.324 --> 00:42:16.034
-What does that mean?
-Well...

816
00:42:16.117 --> 00:42:17.911
Well, is it... is it...
is it gonna explode?

817
00:42:17.994 --> 00:42:19.829
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

818
00:42:19.913 --> 00:42:22.040
Hold it exactly how you're
holding it. Good. Good.

819
00:42:22.332 --> 00:42:24.334
-Okay. Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

820
00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:26.461
That pin holds the handle on.

821
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:29.547
But when you let go of the grenade,
the handle pops off,

822
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:32.509
which lights the fuse,
and the whole thing goes...

823
00:42:33.468 --> 00:42:34.511
boom.

824
00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:36.346
How do you know
so much about grenades?

825
00:42:36.846 --> 00:42:38.139
Video games.

826
00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:40.016
So what should I do?
Should... Should I throw it?

827
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.770
Well, my concern is that you won't be able
to throw it far enough to not blow us up.

828
00:42:43.853 --> 00:42:45.814
-No offense.
-God.

829
00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:48.525
So, what, I just...
I just hold this live grenade?

830
00:42:48.608 --> 00:42:50.652
This grenade is just part of my life now?

831
00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:52.153
Yeah, for now, yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:42:56.074 --> 00:42:57.492
Okay, here's the plan.

833
00:42:58.743 --> 00:42:59.869
We're gonna get a knife.

834
00:42:59.953 --> 00:43:00.912
-Okay. All right.
-I'm gonna cut

835
00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:03.206
through these ties,
we're gonna get rid of that grenade,

836
00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:05.250
and then we're gonna
head down to the docks.

837
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:07.085
We're gonna bum-rush
the pirate guarding it,

838
00:43:07.168 --> 00:43:09.629
hop in a boat, and head
to the next island for help.

839
00:43:10.213 --> 00:43:13.466
-Okay?
-Tom, that plan...

840
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.011
Has too many steps.
I see that now.

841
00:43:16.678 --> 00:43:18.722
Now, you got a simpler one?

842
00:43:19.681 --> 00:43:21.391
-Yes. Yes.
-What?

843
00:43:21.474 --> 00:43:23.351
-Yes. Okay.
-What are you doing?

844
00:43:23.435 --> 00:43:25.061
Get down here. Found it.

845
00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:26.604
-Found it. Yes.
-What are we doing?

846
00:43:26.688 --> 00:43:28.440
-Right here.
-What are we doing?

847
00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:30.650
-Oh.

848
00:43:31.318 --> 00:43:32.360
Oh.

849
00:43:32.444 --> 00:43:34.904
Find cell service. Call for help.

850
00:43:34.988 --> 00:43:36.406
When did you put that in your underwear?

851
00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:39.576
Right before the pirates
took us out of the cabana.

852
00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.494
Because I'm a sneaky little bitch.

853
00:43:41.578 --> 00:43:44.039
Oh, you are a sneaky little bitch.

854
00:43:44.748 --> 00:43:46.041
-Thank you.

855
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:47.625
-Okay.
-Let's start walking.

856
00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:49.544
Sneaky. Sneaky little bitch.

857
00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.590
You're testing my patience, Robert!

858
00:43:53.673 --> 00:43:55.050
Look, you want my money?
I want my daughter.

859
00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:56.718
-It's a simple negotiation.
-Enough!

860
00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:57.802
All right.

861
00:43:57.886 --> 00:43:58.887
They're bringing him back.

862
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.013
Move.

863
00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:02.474
Robert. What happened?
Are you okay?

864
00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:03.600
They didn't hurt you, did they?

865
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:06.978
Well, I'm not giving them a dime
till I know my daughter's alive.

866
00:44:07.062 --> 00:44:08.855
That didn't go over very well.

867
00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:11.733
I'm afraid they're gonna start
shooting the hostages.

868
00:44:11.816 --> 00:44:12.859
I don't think
they're gonna do that.

869
00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:14.819
Isn't that exactly
what pirates do?

870
00:44:22.243 --> 00:44:24.913
Come out, Mr. Pirate Man!

871
00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:33.338
My name

872
00:44:34.464 --> 00:44:37.592
is Carol Elaine Fowler,

873
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.470
and I deserve to live.

874
00:44:41.471 --> 00:44:44.516
Carol, what are you doing?

875
00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:46.101
I'm humanizing myself.

876
00:44:46.184 --> 00:44:47.811
I saw it
on  Good Morning America.

877
00:44:47.894 --> 00:44:51.523
If you humanize yourself to them,
they let you live.

878
00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:57.737
I am a wife. I am a mother.

879
00:44:58.196 --> 00:45:02.909
And I was Milford, Michigan's top realtor
in 1998,

880
00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:05.245
and again in 2007.

881
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:09.374
I dream of going to Ireland.

882
00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:13.711
I was a late bloomer
and my teeth didn't come in till I was 14.

883
00:45:14.337 --> 00:45:15.380
Please pick me.

884
00:45:15.755 --> 00:45:17.549
My name is Jeannie Reed.

885
00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:22.220
I am a devoted mother
and a slightly less devoted wife.

886
00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:24.514
This is my first vacation without my kids,

887
00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:27.225
so I drank a lot of champagne
before the ceremony,

888
00:45:27.308 --> 00:45:28.268
took a couple of weed gummies,

889
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:30.687
and the combination
is really killing me right now.

890
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:34.983
I'm Amanda Walker.
I'm a godmother and a woman in tech.

891
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:37.026
-I went to--
-I am Renata.

892
00:45:38.445 --> 00:45:40.113
I'm from Brazil.

893
00:45:41.114 --> 00:45:43.867
I have beautiful hair.

894
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:44.909
Yeah. Very beautiful.

895
00:45:45.702 --> 00:45:46.828
What else?

896
00:45:48.455 --> 00:45:49.581
You're a mother.

897
00:45:50.457 --> 00:45:51.916
I am a mother.

898
00:45:53.126 --> 00:45:54.502
My name is Ricky Silver.

899
00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:56.629
A lot of my friends, they're pairing up,

900
00:45:56.713 --> 00:45:59.632
and they're getting married
and drinking loose-leaf tea and shit.

901
00:45:59.716 --> 00:46:01.718
And I'm still single. But last night...

902
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:06.973
I made love to a gorgeous
and terrifying woman.

903
00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:08.808
You think I'm terrifying?

904
00:46:09.893 --> 00:46:11.644
You scare the shit out of me.

905
00:46:16.649 --> 00:46:18.151
I'm Larry Fowler.

906
00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:24.449
Oh...

907
00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:25.950
Thank you.

908
00:46:27.494 --> 00:46:28.912
-Oh.
-Oh, easy, Dad.

909
00:46:29.913 --> 00:46:31.080
-Hold the phone. Yes.
-How am I gonna...

910
00:46:31.164 --> 00:46:32.248
-Hold it steady.
-Hold it. Hold on.

911
00:46:32.332 --> 00:46:34.751
I just gotta get this thing
out of my head.

912
00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:37.712
It's driving me crazy.

913
00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.839
-Wait. Hold on. Just wait.
-What are you...

914
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:43.134
What are you...
Are you stuffing a loose wad

915
00:46:43.218 --> 00:46:44.719
of hair in my pocket?

916
00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:47.347
Yes. A loose wad of very expensive,

917
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.432
custom-made hair
that I would like to keep.

918
00:46:49.516 --> 00:46:50.892
If we survive.

919
00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:55.021
What's so funny?

920
00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:58.858
-I've just been...
-Ow, ow, ow!

921
00:46:58.942 --> 00:47:01.611
...questioning everything lately.

922
00:47:01.694 --> 00:47:04.739
What if the wedding's not perfect?
What if your parents never like me?

923
00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:06.950
What does life look like after baseball?

924
00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:08.785
But not once did I wonder

925
00:47:08.868 --> 00:47:13.081
if I'd be walking handcuffed
through the jungle with a live grenade.

926
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:17.961
Oh. Pirates chasing you
wasn't on your vision board?

927
00:47:18.044 --> 00:47:20.213
Well, you were the only thing
on my vision board.

928
00:47:23.633 --> 00:47:24.717
-I got it, I got it, I got it.
-Oh! Oh!

929
00:47:24.801 --> 00:47:26.386
-You got it? You got it?
-I got it. I got it.

930
00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:29.347
-Okay. I got it.
-Oh, good. Okay. Oh.

931
00:47:31.558 --> 00:47:33.518
-We have a bar.
-Oh, good.

932
00:47:34.227 --> 00:47:35.270
All right.

933
00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:36.688
-Keep your hands with me.
-Okay.

934
00:47:36.771 --> 00:47:38.439
-Okay.
-Call for help.

935
00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:40.441
Yes. Shit! It's gone.

936
00:47:41.442 --> 00:47:43.027
-Well, keep trying.

937
00:47:47.156 --> 00:47:48.866
-I think, maybe...
-We have to go higher.

938
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.201
-What?
-Yes.

939
00:47:50.743 --> 00:47:53.246
Not... No. No, no, no.
Uh, I don't like higher.

940
00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:07.051
Yeah, I don't... I don't think
this thing is built to code.

941
00:48:07.135 --> 00:48:08.678
-Tom.
-Anything?

942
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:10.680
No. Come on.

943
00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.641
-Yeah.
-We're almost at the top.

944
00:48:13.725 --> 00:48:16.769
Maybe we should go back down
so we're not up so high.

945
00:48:16.853 --> 00:48:19.731
Don't think about the heights right now.
Okay? We're safe.

946
00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:21.899
Yeah. You use the word "safe"
very loosely.

947
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.027
Oh, my God.

948
00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:30.116
-Full service. Full service.
-Oh, yes.

949
00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:31.451
-I have full service.

950
00:48:31.534 --> 00:48:32.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Silence it.

951
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.454
-I'm trying.

952
00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:41.252
Your group chat is out of control.

953
00:48:41.336 --> 00:48:43.338
I will not apologize
for having enthusiastic friends.

954
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:48.092
Oh! You dropped it.

955
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.969
-Come on!

956
00:48:50.511 --> 00:48:52.221
-We gotta zip.
-Zip?

957
00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:53.598
What do you mean, "zip"?

958
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.684
-Oh! Zip. Oh, God!

959
00:48:56.768 --> 00:48:58.019
Go, go, go.

960
00:48:58.686 --> 00:49:00.563
No, I don't think we have
the proper equipment.

961
00:49:00.647 --> 00:49:02.106
-Well, they have guns.

962
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:03.316
Is there some kind of a manual?

963
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:04.442
Come down!

964
00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:06.986
We need helmets.
I see lots of helmets in the photos.

965
00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:09.405
And then why do they look scared?

966
00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:11.157
Stop thinking so much. Jump!

967
00:49:17.747 --> 00:49:20.541
-Stop screaming!
-Oh, God! Oh, my God!

968
00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:21.876
Whoa!

969
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.127
Tom, don't let go.

970
00:49:23.211 --> 00:49:25.213
-The fuck!

971
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.177
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

972
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.470
Okay.

973
00:49:38.226 --> 00:49:39.227
Uh...

974
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:43.690
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

975
00:49:44.357 --> 00:49:46.192
What the hell was that?

976
00:49:56.911 --> 00:49:57.954
Oh, God!

977
00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.250
-Oh, God!
-How do we land this thing?

978
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:03.793
Me first. I'm gonna go first.

979
00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:06.796
-What about me?
-No, let me. Me first.

980
00:50:06.879 --> 00:50:08.464
I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump.

981
00:50:08.548 --> 00:50:10.800
-Okay, okay.
-I got it. I got it.

982
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:12.135
Here I go!

983
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:47.044
These people are sick.

984
00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:51.215
You find them, but I kill them.

985
00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:55.803
You can have the man,

986
00:50:56.846 --> 00:50:58.639
but the bride is mine.

987
00:51:01.684 --> 00:51:03.519
Police, coast guard,
they're all right there.

988
00:51:03.603 --> 00:51:04.937
-How do we get across?
-I don't know.

989
00:51:05.021 --> 00:51:07.607
Okay, let's all go around
and play two truths and a lie.

990
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:08.733
Be quiet!

991
00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:10.026
-Carol.
-Mom.

992
00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:11.861
-Easy.

993
00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:13.905
Okay, come on.

994
00:51:14.655 --> 00:51:15.948
Come on, come on, come on.

995
00:51:20.995 --> 00:51:22.413
Oh, my God.

996
00:51:22.497 --> 00:51:23.873
Oh, my God.

997
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.126
I'm gonna fix this.

998
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:32.548
My poor mom.

999
00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:35.468
She thought she was gonna be able
to avoid my dad all weekend.

1000
00:51:37.053 --> 00:51:39.597
My mom used to love my dad so much.

1001
00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:43.726
He was her whole world.

1002
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.604
Then when he left, she just lost her joy.

1003
00:51:47.647 --> 00:51:49.232
I mean, she acts tough, but...

1004
00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:53.611
she never really recovered.

1005
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:00.618
-Darcy, I'm sorry...
-I know.

1006
00:52:02.328 --> 00:52:03.704
We have to keep moving.

1007
00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:21.430
What the hell does that mean?

1008
00:52:25.017 --> 00:52:26.018
Kitchen.

1009
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:32.191
Okay, we need to find a knife.

1010
00:52:32.692 --> 00:52:34.777
-Oh. Mmm.
-What... What...

1011
00:52:34.861 --> 00:52:35.820
What are you doing?

1012
00:52:35.903 --> 00:52:37.405
I'm starving. Have you eaten today?

1013
00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:38.573
No, I'm not hungry.

1014
00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:40.032
Yes, you are. You're acting cranky.

1015
00:52:40.116 --> 00:52:42.994
-Mmm. Mmm! Mmm.
-Mmm.

1016
00:52:44.745 --> 00:52:46.956
-Mmm, this is so delicious.

1017
00:52:58.217 --> 00:52:59.844
I love your mom.

1018
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:01.220
Okay, come on.

1019
00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:04.181
Come on. Ow! Easy, easy.

1020
00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:05.558
I can't cut with one hand.

1021
00:53:05.641 --> 00:53:07.268
Well, I can't cut with no hands.

1022
00:53:11.898 --> 00:53:13.691
We need to find something else.

1023
00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:14.901
Okay?

1024
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:17.987
Something that cuts through plastic.

1025
00:53:18.905 --> 00:53:20.281
Hmm...

1026
00:53:22.909 --> 00:53:23.910
Yep.

1027
00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:30.374
-Is this a bad idea?
-Yeah.

1028
00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:32.293
-You ready?
-No!

1029
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.921
Okay.

1030
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.383
There you go.

1031
00:53:41.177 --> 00:53:42.595
Hang on, hang on, hang on!

1032
00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:43.804
Darcy, you're stalling.

1033
00:53:43.888 --> 00:53:45.014
-I know.
-We got this.

1034
00:53:45.097 --> 00:53:46.182
-Okay. Yes.
-We got this.

1035
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:48.559
-On my count. Ready?
-Okay.

1036
00:53:48.643 --> 00:53:51.479
-Yes.
-Ten, nine, eight...

1037
00:53:51.562 --> 00:53:53.230
Why are you counting from ten?

1038
00:53:53.314 --> 00:53:54.565
What is this, a rocket launch?

1039
00:53:54.649 --> 00:53:55.691
Okay, fine. On four.

1040
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:59.779
One, two, three--

1041
00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:01.280
No one goes on four.

1042
00:54:01.364 --> 00:54:02.823
-No one goes on four.
-All right...

1043
00:54:02.907 --> 00:54:04.158
Shh! Shh.

1044
00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:05.993
-Okay.
-Just...

1045
00:54:06.077 --> 00:54:08.245
-Just like a Band-Aid.
-Fine, fine.

1046
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:09.538
-Ready? Go.
-Like a Band-Aid.

1047
00:54:20.967 --> 00:54:22.802
Oh, my God.

1048
00:54:27.223 --> 00:54:28.683
Come on.

1049
00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:06.804
Tom!

1050
00:55:08.597 --> 00:55:09.849
Tom.

1051
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:03.652
I thought you left.

1052
00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:06.197
What?

1053
00:56:08.657 --> 00:56:09.658
No.

1054
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:12.536
Never.

1055
00:56:16.916 --> 00:56:18.334
Where'd your mom's knife go?

1056
00:56:29.678 --> 00:56:31.514
Oh, Jesus, help me.

1057
00:56:37.603 --> 00:56:39.271
That's good.

1058
00:56:40.689 --> 00:56:41.941
Throw me those boots.

1059
00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:08.843
What?

1060
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.805
That dress is growing on me.

1061
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.642
Thanks.

1062
00:57:17.393 --> 00:57:19.019
I wanted something less traditional.

1063
00:57:48.299 --> 00:57:51.177
Yes. Maybe Margy's got
a hard line to the Internet.

1064
00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:54.305
Wow, does Margy love corgis.

1065
00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:57.850
No. Damn it.

1066
00:57:58.976 --> 00:58:00.686
You go over there,
I'll go here.

1067
00:58:00.769 --> 00:58:02.146
-Yeah.
-They're right there.

1068
00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:03.772
-What do I do?
-I don't know.

1069
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:05.566
I don't know.

1070
00:58:08.194 --> 00:58:09.737
-Oh, Margy.
-This way.

1071
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.905
Go, go, go.

1072
00:58:11.947 --> 00:58:13.324
Okay. I got you.

1073
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:15.284
It's okay. It's okay.

1074
00:58:17.453 --> 00:58:19.121
Come. Faster, faster.

1075
00:58:20.122 --> 00:58:21.874
Ace, Margy...

1076
00:58:21.957 --> 00:58:23.751
-Is this your bunker?
-Uh-huh.

1077
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:24.793
-Man cave.
-Is it spinning?

1078
00:58:24.877 --> 00:58:25.920
Is it spinning for anyone else?

1079
00:58:26.295 --> 00:58:28.047
You're losing blood. Sit down.

1080
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.674
-Sit down. Okay.
-Bandages. Ace.

1081
00:58:30.758 --> 00:58:32.426
I'll get the medical kit.

1082
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.136
Give me your hand. I'm gonna wrap it.

1083
00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.096
No. No, no, no. No.

1084
00:58:36.722 --> 00:58:38.182
Are you sure? It's disgusting.

1085
00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:40.684
Yeah.

1086
00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:48.817
Oh. Cheers.

1087
00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:52.988
Okay.

1088
00:58:53.072 --> 00:58:55.449
Looks like it's got a flap.

1089
00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.160
It's got a loose flap.

1090
00:58:58.244 --> 00:58:59.411
-Listen, just be...
-Mm-hmm.

1091
00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:02.289
Just... Just be careful with the flap.

1092
00:59:02.373 --> 00:59:04.750
Please stop saying "flap," okay?

1093
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:06.961
I'm totally fine. Just don't say flap.

1094
00:59:07.753 --> 00:59:09.838
-How many are there?
-Uh...

1095
00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:13.259
Two in the lobby.
Couple more by the pool with the hostages.

1096
00:59:13.342 --> 00:59:16.345
And, uh, one by the dock, right?

1097
00:59:16.428 --> 00:59:18.681
But we got four.

1098
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:20.933
What do you mean, "got"?

1099
00:59:24.228 --> 00:59:26.647
Got them to stop, you know,

1100
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:29.149
being alive.

1101
00:59:29.942 --> 00:59:31.610
Holy shit.

1102
00:59:31.694 --> 00:59:33.988
Well, yeah, we didn't see
any of your staff, though.

1103
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:36.323
I saw them getting locked up in the spa.

1104
00:59:36.407 --> 00:59:37.908
They never bother with the locals.

1105
00:59:37.992 --> 00:59:41.245
Americans are the rich idiots. No offense.

1106
00:59:41.328 --> 00:59:44.164
I just don't understand
why the pirates are still here.

1107
00:59:44.248 --> 00:59:46.000
Last time, they just looted the rooms.

1108
00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:49.169
Twenty minutes, gone.

1109
00:59:50.462 --> 00:59:51.672
What do you mean, "last time"?

1110
00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:53.590
Last year.

1111
00:59:53.674 --> 00:59:55.634
Two thousand islands
in the Philippines,

1112
00:59:55.718 --> 00:59:56.885
and they hit us twice?

1113
00:59:56.969 --> 00:59:58.345
-It's not fair.
-Wait, wait.

1114
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.682
The pirates were here last summer?

1115
01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.267
And you let us have our wedding here?

1116
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.854
What? Tom-Tom. We talked about it, huh?

1117
01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:10.399
You knew about this?

1118
01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.526
Well, first of all,
nobody got killed last summer.

1119
01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.652
And we both agreed that

1120
01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:15.946
the chances of it happening again
were very small.

1121
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.823
-Who's "we"?
-Me and Margy.

1122
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.616
We e-mailed a lot,

1123
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.535
and I asked a lot of
tough questions, didn't I?

1124
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.787
How could you not tell me about this?

1125
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.372
You didn't tell me that
you were having doubts

1126
01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:26.623
about getting married, so...

1127
01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:29.585
Yeah, you're right. I didn't.
You know why?

1128
01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:33.839
Because all last year,
you were in your head about everything.

1129
01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.717
You thought my dad didn't like you,
so you started acting all weird.

1130
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.093
And now my dad doesn't like you.

1131
01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:40.304
You thought the Robins
were gonna drop you.

1132
01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:42.723
And then you started playing badly,
and they did drop you.

1133
01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.808
You think that something bad
is gonna happen,

1134
01:00:44.892 --> 01:00:46.727
and then you make it happen.

1135
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.270
That's called self-sabotage.

1136
01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:50.397
It is. Ace, thank you.

1137
01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.525
And all you were excited about
was this wedding.

1138
01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:56.653
And I knew that if I told you
that I was having doubts,

1139
01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.781
that you would sabotage
our whole relationship.

1140
01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.407
Which you did anyway!

1141
01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:02.034
I didn't sabotage anything.

1142
01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.244
I tried to make this wedding perfect.

1143
01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.081
And it all got ruined the day
your boy Sean showed up.

1144
01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.874
This has nothing to do with Sean.

1145
01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.709
This is about your insecurities.

1146
01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:12.127
And this whole wedding

1147
01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:14.713
was your way of trying
to get control of your life,

1148
01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:16.048
because you have to control everything.

1149
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:19.009
It's like when you get out of the car
to "help me" parallel park,

1150
01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.677
when I can do it just fine on my own.

1151
01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:22.388
Yeah, I wouldn't call
a 17-point turn "just fine."

1152
01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:24.556
Well, those jeans you bought
from Old Navy last month

1153
01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.891
were women's jeans.

1154
01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:27.142
Uh...

1155
01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:28.685
Well, I found them in the men's section.

1156
01:01:28.769 --> 01:01:30.104
They made you look like Stevie Nicks.

1157
01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.731
That haircut that you got last year,
I hated it.

1158
01:01:32.815 --> 01:01:35.359
It made your head look square.
You looked like a fucking Simpson.

1159
01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.985
You said it was chic.

1160
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:38.779
You act so confident,

1161
01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.572
so strong,
but you're just a scared little girl.

1162
01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:44.493
You're afraid to go all in
on this relationship

1163
01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.870
because it means you might
have something to lose.

1164
01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:56.046
Well, you know what?
None of it matters anyway.

1165
01:01:57.131 --> 01:02:00.342
Because everyone we love could die.

1166
01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:04.972
Because of me.

1167
01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.952
I think they're
in the manager's house.

1168
01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.569
I think they heard it.

1169
01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:01.820
Why?

1170
01:03:01.904 --> 01:03:03.572
They stopped speaking English.

1171
01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:06.742
Here. Take it.

1172
01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:09.953
Don't. Tom.

1173
01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:14.333
We need to get out of here.
Where does this tunnel go?

1174
01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:17.544
It leads straight to the pool
where the rest of the pirates are.

1175
01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:19.171
Oh, that's not ideal.

1176
01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:24.760
What are they saying?

1177
01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:26.512
No clue.

1178
01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:30.015
I don't know what language that is,
but it ain't Filipino.

1179
01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:32.142
-No.
-No.

1180
01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.482
No one move. Stay right here.

1181
01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:40.192
Nobody move.

1182
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.861
What are you doing?

1183
01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:53.705
Okay.

1184
01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.792
They know someone's here,
but they don't know all of us are.

1185
01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:01.964
You stay here until it's over.

1186
01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:04.258
Tom!

1187
01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:10.764
Tom! They're gonna kill you.

1188
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.474
-Don't do this.
-I have to.

1189
01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:15.394
This isn't about us anymore. This is...

1190
01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:19.064
This whole thing is my fault.

1191
01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:24.069
You deserve better.

1192
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:25.862
Wait, Tom!

1193
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.876
Uh... Oh, hey.

1194
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.253
Hey, pirates!

1195
01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:43.714
I'm Tom, the groom you guys
have been looking for,

1196
01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:44.798
and I am officially surrendering.

1197
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:45.882
-Shut up!
-All right.

1198
01:04:45.966 --> 01:04:47.301
What, you don't like
to be called "pirates"?

1199
01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:50.512
I wanted to be a pirate when I was a kid,
and you guys are actually doin' it.

1200
01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:52.014
-Move.
-You're livin' the dream.

1201
01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:53.056
Congratulations.

1202
01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:56.393
They didn't kill him. Oh, my God.

1203
01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:57.686
He's still alive.

1204
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:00.772
Go!

1205
01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:03.734
Keep going. Just move.

1206
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.322
Tommy. Oh, my God.
It's Tommy. Tommy!

1207
01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.157
-Shut up!

1208
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.783
-Tommy, where is Darcy?
-Shut up!

1209
01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:14.745
Yes. Where is your bride?

1210
01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:16.496
-I... I don't know.

1211
01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:19.750
Truly. Honestly. I... I... I don't.

1212
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.294
For reals. I don't...
I don't... I don't know.

1213
01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:24.796
You're a bad liar.

1214
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.423
Yeah, he is a bad liar.

1215
01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:29.426
Tom, if you know something,
the best thing you can do is cooperate.

1216
01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:31.094
All they want is the money.

1217
01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:35.599
You know what? Thank you, Sean,
as always, for being the voice of reason.

1218
01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:36.683
Enough!

1219
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.270
-Okay, fine!
-Okay.

1220
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.648
I'll tell you where she is.

1221
01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:49.696
Katuk kak ci.

1222
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.739
-What?

1223
01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:53.659
Holy shit. What did you say to him?

1224
01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:55.160
It's kind of an inside joke, Sean.

1225
01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:56.662
Can you give me a hand?
I'm a little woozy.

1226
01:05:56.745 --> 01:05:58.455
'Course, man. Here, I got you.

1227
01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.957
-Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

1228
01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:03.293
-What the hell are you doing?

1229
01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:05.337
Don't move or I swear to God,
you'll lose an eye.

1230
01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.588
Tommy, what are you doing?

1231
01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.256
Are you gonna spill the beans or should I?

1232
01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.341
What beans?

1233
01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:10.884
Just spill the beans.

1234
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.552
Sean hired these guys

1235
01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.097
to invade our wedding
to take Robert's money!

1236
01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.265
Whoa. No, no, no, no, Tom.

1237
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:18.433
No, it's true.

1238
01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:20.977
That is a serious accusation,

1239
01:06:21.061 --> 01:06:22.437
but it's okay,

1240
01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:24.731
'cause jealousy can get
the best of any of us.

1241
01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.316
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not jealous.

1242
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.734
-Kind of.

1243
01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:30.570
It is completely normal
for you to see me as a threat

1244
01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:31.988
because Deedee and I

1245
01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:33.865
-had something transcendent.

1246
01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:36.118
But I am not a bad guy.

1247
01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:38.328
And I definitely don't have
anything to do with these pirates.

1248
01:06:38.412 --> 01:06:42.374
Oh, yeah? Then why did he deck me
when I told him to go fuck his grandpa?

1249
01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:44.459
Just listen. Listen to yourself.

1250
01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:46.712
I said it in Balinese.
These guys are not local.

1251
01:06:46.795 --> 01:06:48.088
They're from Bali.

1252
01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:51.174
Margy said the local pirates
just looted and left last time.

1253
01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:52.759
It took 'em, like, 20 minutes.

1254
01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:54.261
Oh, God. "Last time"?

1255
01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.263
We were clearly targeted.
This whole thing was planned.

1256
01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:59.141
They knew about Robert's money.

1257
01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:02.561
And none of it made sense
until I found this.

1258
01:07:06.106 --> 01:07:07.691
Ricky, grab my... Grab the... the...

1259
01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:09.276
-Yeah, yeah.
-In my front pocket. Grab...

1260
01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.485
There's an envelope in my front pocket.

1261
01:07:10.569 --> 01:07:12.654
-Just grab it!

1262
01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:14.156
There you go.

1263
01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:15.699
A-ha!

1264
01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:17.367
Slow, slow. Go slow.

1265
01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:20.370
Your wedding invitation?

1266
01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:22.998
Yes, but I got it off
of one of these guys.

1267
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:25.459
Now, how did they get that invitation?

1268
01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.127
-I don't know.
-Uh...

1269
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.588
It had to be given to him
by an invited guest.

1270
01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:33.425
Now, what invited guest
could that be? Huh?

1271
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:37.429
Ricky, op... open it.

1272
01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.682
A-ha!

1273
01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:46.605
This asshat thought it was appropriate
to show up to a wedding he didn't RSVP to!

1274
01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.774
He didn't RSVP!

1275
01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.776
Mom, that's not the main issue right now.

1276
01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:54.362
Look, I'm a mother. I can be upset
about a lot of things at the same time.

1277
01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:55.989
I think, right now, we should be upset
about one thing.

1278
01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:59.159
-Oh, okay.
-Sean had these guys

1279
01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.661
crash our wedding
so that he could get a big fat ransom

1280
01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.246
from his best friend, Robert.

1281
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.126
Huh? Yeah!

1282
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.212
-Bob... Bob.
-Yes!

1283
01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:11.713
This is because I didn't give you

1284
01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:13.548
that investment money
you wanted, isn't it?

1285
01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:15.050
-Yeah.
-No, no, it's not like that.

1286
01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.802
-How could...  Papi.

1287
01:08:16.885 --> 01:08:19.554
How could you believe
that I would come here and betray ev...

1288
01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:20.847
Believe it, Robert. Believe it.

1289
01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:23.934
-That's right. That's right.
-Shit.

1290
01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:35.654
See? See, I told ya! I told ya!

1291
01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:41.535
These lanterns are so intricate.
Is there a note in it?

1292
01:08:46.414 --> 01:08:48.792
"Be excellent to each other."

1293
01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.544
-Hmm.
-Hmm. Huh.

1294
01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:01.513
It's from  Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.

1295
01:09:02.722 --> 01:09:06.351
Tom wanted to put a movie quote
in each one of the lanterns, and I...

1296
01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:09.729
I thought it was stupid, but it's not.

1297
01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:12.023
It's sweet.

1298
01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:14.025
And I messed it all up.

1299
01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:16.152
I don't know how you guys do it.

1300
01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:19.281
You must have something
really special.

1301
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:22.325
-Not really.
-Oi.

1302
01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:26.204
Uh, I mean, it is special
but it is not magic.

1303
01:09:26.288 --> 01:09:28.373
We just made a vow.

1304
01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:31.126
And we've messed things up
thousands of times.

1305
01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:35.171
But when we break something, we fix it.

1306
01:09:49.686 --> 01:09:53.064
Darcy, we come with you,
but we don't want to.

1307
01:09:59.738 --> 01:10:01.740
Tommy finally made the big leagues.

1308
01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:04.034
Yeah, I never heard that one before.

1309
01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:06.119
I know you haven't.

1310
01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:09.331
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

1311
01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.916
I don't... I... I don't... I don't know.

1312
01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:13.793
-You're lying.
-No, I'm... I'm... Honestly,

1313
01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.420
-I don't know.
-Okay.

1314
01:10:19.049 --> 01:10:20.091
God damn it!

1315
01:10:20.175 --> 01:10:21.468
-Would you stop doing that?
-Yeah.

1316
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.429
-He'll do it again.
-Fine. Fine.

1317
01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:25.597
I was lying.

1318
01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.685
After we cut ourselves loose,
Darcy and I got into a fight.

1319
01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:33.188
She hopped in a golf cart
to go look for cell reception

1320
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.941
up by the northern coast
near the cliffs, and then I...

1321
01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:38.109
I came back here
to try to rescue everyone.

1322
01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:39.819
Come on!

1323
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.200
Okay.

1324
01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:48.286
We'll take the chopper to find her.

1325
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.788
I'm comin' with you.

1326
01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.915
I've been watching you
mess this up all day.

1327
01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.667
This is my show now.

1328
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.126
Wow, that's really good.

1329
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.962
We're doing this my way now. You got it?

1330
01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:58.964
We need collateral.

1331
01:11:09.516 --> 01:11:10.517
Get the girlfriend.

1332
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.894
-Hey. Come.

1333
01:11:12.978 --> 01:11:14.938
-Here. Move!
-Ow! Hey.

1334
01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:16.564
Oh, no.

1335
01:11:16.648 --> 01:11:18.692
-Go. Move!
-Please, I'm a Gemini.

1336
01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:20.485
I bruise easily.

1337
01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.779
-Go!
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

1338
01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:24.656
-Oh, my God!
-Robert? Robert!

1339
01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:27.617
When I get back,
that money better be in my account.

1340
01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:29.369
And if it's not, she's dead.

1341
01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.371
And I treated you just like a son.

1342
01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.957
-You're stuck with Tommy now.
-Robert.

1343
01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.251
-Well, what's wrong with that?
-Fuck off.

1344
01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1345
01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:05.488
Darcy...

1346
01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:10.368
Tom, you promised you wouldn't
leave my side this weekend.

1347
01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:11.870
Darcy, what are you doing?

1348
01:12:12.287 --> 01:12:13.455
Tom, listen.

1349
01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.541
I'm still mad at you
for picking this pirate island,

1350
01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:19.210
but I messed up too.
I should've told you...

1351
01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.422
how scared I was to get married.

1352
01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:24.507
That wasn't fair.

1353
01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:26.426
You worked so hard
on this pirate island wedding.

1354
01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.511
Okay, no, no, no.
Please stop calling it that.

1355
01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.889
I just worried that if I told you...

1356
01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.934
that I would lose you.

1357
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.607
And I can't lose you.

1358
01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:44.444
I need you.

1359
01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:49.741
Okay?

1360
01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:54.412
Okay?

1361
01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:55.413
-Okay.

1362
01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:57.082
-Okay.
-Okay.

1363
01:12:57.165 --> 01:12:59.209
This is so much better than  South Pacific.

1364
01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.752
And Mom, Dad?

1365
01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:04.255
Whoa!

1366
01:13:04.339 --> 01:13:05.381
-Babe.
-What the fuck?

1367
01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:06.424
Did you just shoot me?

1368
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.676
Stop shooting your sister!

1369
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.096
I didn't mean to. It was a mistake. I...

1370
01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:16.392
Mom, Dad, apologize to Tom.

1371
01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:18.019
-What? Why?
-What?

1372
01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:20.647
For criticizing this beautiful wedding
that he planned,

1373
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:23.650
and for never making him
feel welcome in our family.

1374
01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:25.735
And for inviting Sean to our wedding.

1375
01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:27.612
Okay, honey, but I think there's

1376
01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:29.280
-a more pressing issue...
-Apologize!

1377
01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:31.407
-He is the best person

1378
01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:32.492
that I know.

1379
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.577
And if you say one more bad thing
about him,

1380
01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:36.996
I swear I will shoot you
like I shot Jamie.

1381
01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:39.707
Tom, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1382
01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.000
-Tom, sorry. Sorry.
-We love you.

1383
01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.168
-Oh, hey, it's fine.
-You're the best person

1384
01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:43.503
-I've ever met.
-It's okay. I love you.

1385
01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:44.838
-We love you like family.
-I love you, too.

1386
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.756
-All right. It's all good.
-I love this place. Beautiful.

1387
01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.091
And, Carol, Larry...

1388
01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.467
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1389
01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:53.388
This was more about me and my family,
but we should get lunch sometime.

1390
01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:54.472
-I would...
-Oh, yeah,

1391
01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:55.974
-lunch sounds great. Yeah.
-We love eating.

1392
01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:58.268
It's hard for anyone to live up
to your perfect marriage.

1393
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.436
Who told you
we had a perfect marriage?

1394
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.772
Oh, come on, Mom.
You guys fought, like, once.

1395
01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:04.149
It was about who loved the dog more.

1396
01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:06.359
I mean, what is not perfect
about your marriage?

1397
01:14:06.985 --> 01:14:09.988
Well, I made love to your Aunt Marie.

1398
01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:11.322
-What?

1399
01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:12.866
-Yeah.
-Then I went out

1400
01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.617
and started doing all this weird sex stuff

1401
01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:15.869
with Jim Roberts.

1402
01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.203
Yeah. You and Jim Roberts

1403
01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.080
-went on for a couple months.
-Yes.

1404
01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:21.708
-Because our bodies just fit.
-Holy...

1405
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.460
In the end,
Jim Roberts just wasn't your dad.

1406
01:14:24.544 --> 01:14:26.796
And Aunt Marie realized
that she had a sex addiction.

1407
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.216
But then you know what? We worked it out.

1408
01:14:33.178 --> 01:14:34.929
These are some incredible breakthroughs,

1409
01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:36.347
-right? I mean...
-Give me that!

1410
01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:38.808
You remember me, huh?

1411
01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:40.852
Look, you burn my face. Huh?

1412
01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.478
Yes, I know. I still feel
really bad about that.

1413
01:14:46.024 --> 01:14:47.984
Everybody, in the pool! Now!

1414
01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.113
Get in the pool! In!

1415
01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:54.407
Go! Go!

1416
01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:59.204
-Hey, you okay?
-Yes.

1417
01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:00.955
-Yeah?
-Are we missing people?

1418
01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:03.917
Yeah. Turns out
your boy Sean's an asshole.

1419
01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:06.836
We have the bride.

1420
01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.546
-Do you copy?

1421
01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:11.341
Do you copy?

1422
01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:18.306
Up! Up!

1423
01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:20.516
-Listen to me. Move.

1424
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.478
Balinese? So these guys are Balinese?

1425
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:26.397
And Sean is full of shit,
and they took Harriett hostage?

1426
01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:27.523
It doesn't make sense.

1427
01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:29.859
Why would Sean take Harriett hostage
on the helicopter

1428
01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:31.778
when she was already
being held hostage here?

1429
01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:34.405
I don't know. Maybe he wanted
to take her extra hostage.

1430
01:15:34.489 --> 01:15:36.366
I think Harriett is in on it.

1431
01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:39.410
-What?
-What do you mean?

1432
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.918
Harriett and Sean...

1433
01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:49.254
are boyfriend-girlfriend.

1434
01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:50.797
-Oh, come on.
-Boyfriend-girlfriend?

1435
01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.257
No, no. Look.

1436
01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:54.634
This is from last night.

1437
01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.636
Here we go.

1438
01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.764
Let's see.

1439
01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:02.684
Uh, hold on. Let me find it.

1440
01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:05.436
Oh. Oh, boy.

1441
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.105
Yeah. There you go.

1442
01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:17.740
What? Go ahead. Say it.

1443
01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:18.908
Roberto...

1444
01:16:22.829 --> 01:16:24.539
Lo siento.

1445
01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.293
Gracias.

1446
01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:30.920
De nada.

1447
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.050
There!

1448
01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.476
Sean, you promised
this job would make us rich.

1449
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.770
So far, all it's done
is killed four of my men.

1450
01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:49.272
Man, you know we can fix this.

1451
01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.941
Deal is off. I keep the money.

1452
01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:54.152
You walk away with your life.

1453
01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:56.779
I don't wanna hear it.
You and I had an arrangement.

1454
01:16:56.863 --> 01:16:59.240
Sean, be reasonable. He saved us.

1455
01:16:59.324 --> 01:17:01.200
-We're lucky to be alive.
-What are you talking about?

1456
01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.536
Listen to your woman.

1457
01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.038
-Oh.

1458
01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:07.749
It's okay. It's just a pressure point.
Relax.

1459
01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.001
Just breathe into it.

1460
01:17:10.752 --> 01:17:11.878
What?

1461
01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:14.589
What?

1462
01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:16.507
Take us back down.

1463
01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:18.801
We'll finish the job ourselves.

1464
01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:20.428
-Babe.
-What?

1465
01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.890
-Excellent idea.
-Yeah, I know.

1466
01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.517
I have to do everything myself!

1467
01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:31.522
What are we gonna do?
They'll be back any minute.

1468
01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:33.524
-Just...
-Hey, hey, hey!

1469
01:17:34.192 --> 01:17:36.861
No whispers.
Or I throw grenade in the pool.

1470
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:43.951
Okay.

1471
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.996
Go with me, okay?

1472
01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.289
Just go with me.

1473
01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.333
Hey, everybody.

1474
01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:53.628
Look, I know this may
not be the best time,

1475
01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.215
but this may be our only chance
to have our wedding.

1476
01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.218
What do you say, Darcy?

1477
01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:02.929
Yeah, I... I love it.

1478
01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.474
Can... Can we do bride's side on the left
and groom's on the right?

1479
01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:13.064
Hey, Margy, will you officiate?

1480
01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:16.317
Hey, will you stop?
Stop it! Stop it now!

1481
01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:17.777
Wait, wait. If...

1482
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.197
If you let my daughter have her wedding,
I'll... I'll release the funds.

1483
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.580
Okay, let's go.

1484
01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:38.047
Let's go.

1485
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.049
Thanks, Dad.

1486
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:41.717
It's okay, princess.

1487
01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:43.594
There are some things
that are more important than money.

1488
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.973
I don't know what they are,
but I think, uh...

1489
01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.654

I think you'd regret that.

1515
01:20:53.975 --> 01:20:55.601
Oh! No, no. Stop.

1516
01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:56.769
I'm fairly new to grenades.

1517
01:20:56.852 --> 01:21:00.731
But I'm pretty sure that if you shoot me,
this springy thing pops off,

1518
01:21:00.815 --> 01:21:02.692
and then this thing blows us all away.

1519
01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:04.026
-Ain't that right, babe?
-That's right, baby.

1520
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:06.237
-No, no, no.
-What the...

1521
01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:07.822
Drop the guns.

1522
01:21:10.324 --> 01:21:11.826
-No.

1523
01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:25.464
I can't throw that far.
It won't reach him.

1524
01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.636
Nobody fucks with my family.

1525
01:21:43.316 --> 01:21:45.401
Darcy? Give me a meatball.

1526
01:21:45.693 --> 01:21:46.861
-Shit.

1527
01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.253
I know where to go!

1528
01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:06.213
Let's get moving! Out of the pool!

1529
01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:07.590
-Yeah!
-Come on! Come, come, come!

1530
01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.050
Get out of the pool! Come on!

1531
01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.013
-Yeah, let's go.
-Margy! The spa!

1532
01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:15.556
It's safe in the spa!

1533
01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.850
They should've been
killing hostages every hour.

1534
01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.353
Killing people works, Sean.

1535
01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:21.979
-Fuck.
-Look, give me one chance

1536
01:22:22.063 --> 01:22:23.064
to convince Darcy.

1537
01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:25.566
-All right? One.
-Fine. One chance.

1538
01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:28.861
Thank you, baby.

1539
01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:32.073
This is not a moment right now, Sean.

1540
01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:36.160
-Move, come on! Come on!
-All right!

1541
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:40.289
Mom! Mom, we're gonna go get help.

1542
01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:42.375
I need you to take care of them.
Can you do that?

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:46.462

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.423

Hey, wasn't this
the plan with too many steps?

1570
01:24:54.924 --> 01:24:56.258
You did this for me?

1571
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.094
Is this what you wanted?

1572
01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:00.763
Just you and me
in the middle of the ocean?

1573
01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:06.060
Darcy, I'm sorry
I stopped listening to you.

1574
01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.270
I just thought that
if I planned the perfect wedding,

1575
01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:10.272
we could have the perfect marriage, but...

1576
01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:12.441
But that doesn't exist.

1577
01:25:13.067 --> 01:25:14.735
I mean, look at my parents.

1578
01:25:14.819 --> 01:25:16.987
My Aunt Marie, the sex addict.

1579
01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:21.617
I just wanna be with you.
All that matters is you.

1580
01:25:22.368 --> 01:25:23.786
We don't ever have to get married.

1581
01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:27.414
And if we survive this thing,
can we just...

1582
01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.209
Can we start over?

1583
01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:37.508
Go, go, go, go.

1584
01:25:37.925 --> 01:25:39.760
Deedee, listen to me!

1585
01:25:40.427 --> 01:25:43.264
Deedee, this is
a huge misunderstanding, all right?

1586
01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:47.768
Let's go back to the resort,
talk this over. I do not want to hurt you.

1587
01:25:47.852 --> 01:25:49.395
Then stop shooting at us, asshole!

1588
01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.397
And stop calling her Deedee!

1589
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.065
-Fuck!
-Oh, Jesus!

1590
01:25:54.275 --> 01:25:55.734
This thing is awful!

1591
01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.903
Yeah!

1592
01:25:58.237 --> 01:26:00.906
Asshole! Fuckin' leave! What the fuck?

1593
01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:05.536
God, I can't believe you, Sean!
When did you turn into such a monster?

1594
01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.621
I am not a monster!

1595
01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:09.081
I'm an entrepreneur!

1596
01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.624
I think I'm out of ammo.

1597
01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:12.084
-Are you sure?
-Not at all.

1598
01:26:12.543 --> 01:26:13.627
Hey.

1599
01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:19.884
-Yeah.
-I don't wanna do this.

1600
01:26:19.967 --> 01:26:21.302
-I'm a good guy, damn it!

1601
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:24.388
-Shit.

1602
01:26:24.972 --> 01:26:26.390
Your boat's dead.

1603
01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:29.935
We're both out of ammo. Let's just go back
and we can work this whole thing out.

1604
01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:40.988
Tom!

1605
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.534
Go, go!

1606
01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.322
Darcy, turn this boat around right now.

1607
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.741
No.

1608
01:27:28.452 --> 01:27:31.121
You're a piece of shit, Sean,
but I know you can't kill me.

1609
01:27:31.205 --> 01:27:32.206
You're right.

1610
01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.625
But I would love to kill this guy.

1611
01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:37.836
You just keep messing things up, man.
This is on you.

1612
01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.881
I don't wanna do this. I'm a good guy.

1613
01:27:41.966 --> 01:27:43.300
No, you're not.

1614
01:27:44.093 --> 01:27:46.178
All right, you're right. I'm not.

1615
01:28:00.985 --> 01:28:02.152
Sean!

1616
01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:10.035
You were a pity invite!

1617
01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:11.453
-Shit!

1618
01:28:11.537 --> 01:28:13.288
Whoa! Whoa!

1619
01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:21.380
No! Fuck!

1620
01:28:46.739 --> 01:28:48.574
Is that a wad of loose hair?

1621
01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.159
Custom-made hair!

1622
01:29:08.135 --> 01:29:09.094
-Get down!

1623
01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:15.392
Oh, frick.

1624
01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:24.860
Hold on.

1625
01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.534
Oh, shit.

1626
01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:48.801
Holy shit.

1627
01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.711
So when I asked you before

1628
01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:27.506
if we could start over...

1629
01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:31.885
I don't wanna start over.

1630
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:44.815
I wanna keep going.

1631
01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:00.747
Tom Fowler,

1632
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:03.250
will you marry me?

1633
01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:11.008
Are you sure?

1634
01:31:12.926 --> 01:31:14.052
You're not scared?

1635
01:31:16.013 --> 01:31:17.890
I'm terrified.

1636
01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:21.977
Life is always gonna be chaotic.

1637
01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:25.689
But what I know for sure...

1638
01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:30.152
is that I wanna go through
all of it with you.

1639
01:31:32.905 --> 01:31:34.948
It's simple, really.

1640
01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:38.702
Just a plan with one step.

1641
01:31:48.462 --> 01:31:49.546
Still fits.

1642
01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:11.443
Stop. Be quiet.

1643
01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:38.095
Shit! Sorry! Sorry!

1644
01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:39.846
There was one firework left

1645
01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.974
and I thought it would be fun,
and beautiful, and poignant,

1646
01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:43.684
-but it was absolutely not!

1647
01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:45.102
