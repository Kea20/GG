1
00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.350
Alrighty, we're
gearin' up to ring in the New Year

2
00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:33.615
here at Snow Falls' top-rated radio
station for the past 13 years in a row,

3
00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:37.488
and we wanna hear all about your
past, present, and future New Year's Eves.

4
00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:40.491
Call in with
your wild and craziest stories

5
00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:45.366
for a chance to win tickets to the
world-famous Snow Falls Ski Resort.

6
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.847
Following a tragic plane crash
in the East Hills area,

7
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.371
we're still awaiting information

8
00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:53.635
on how many passengers
were on board the aircraft,

9
00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:56.028
but it is believed
to be weather-related.

10
00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:58.683
...the highly
contagious SARS-like virus

11
00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:01.164
seems to be spreading
rapidly overseas.

12
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:03.079
On the...

13
00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:13.045
I thought you said you weren't
gonna study at the cabin.

14
00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.875
We agreed I wouldn't study
at the cabin, not in the car.

15
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.358
Hey, how much longer?

16
00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:24.405
- GPS says 15 minutes.
- Thank God.

17
00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:34.806
You know, not to be
the mom of the group, but...

18
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.549
that's really dangerous
if we wrecked.

19
00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:41.204
Em, you're so paranoid.

20
00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:43.380
Yeah, well, Kit refuses
to wear a seatbelt,

21
00:02:43.424 --> 00:02:45.208
which I think is worse.

22
00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:48.690
Well, I'm sorry that I like
to live on the edge, okay?

23
00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:52.868
- Plus, it's natural selection, so...
- Natural selection.

24
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:55.000
I mean, people need
organ donors. Right, Eden?

25
00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:29.078
Damn, River. Is this
your family's second home?

26
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:32.734
Uh, third, if you count the one
we built in Martha's Vineyard.

27
00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:37.304
Jesus.

28
00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:45.877
Andy, you might wanna
sit down for this.

29
00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:47.662
There's, uh, no signal.

30
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:50.360
Uh, you can sometimes get
service up on the hill, but it's spotty.

31
00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:58.760
Quiet. It's what we came
here for, right?

32
00:04:05.288 --> 00:04:07.812
- Is there any Wi-Fi?
- Put those on the fridge.

33
00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:11.294
Uh, okay, so two bedrooms
downstairs, three upstairs,

34
00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:13.165
and you guys can fight
over the ones that you want,

35
00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.864
and Eden gets the master.

36
00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:17.344
Thanks.

37
00:05:06.523 --> 00:05:08.699
Hey, neighbor.

38
00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:10.745
I'm takin' the room
across the hall.

39
00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:12.703
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

40
00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:15.576
Shot o'clock!
Kitchen, in five minutes!

41
00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:25.673
Hey, guys! I got
a little service after all.

42
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.284
Oh.

43
00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.592
Hey, son, did you make it
there safe?

44
00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:33.507
Just walked in.

45
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.552
Uh, can you... can you hear me?

46
00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:37.380
The... the connection's weak.

47
00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:39.295
- There safe?
- Um, uh, yeah, there you go.

48
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.905
Now, I know I don't need
to remind you,

49
00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.342
but take care of
the place, all right?

50
00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.082
The antiques.

51
00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:46.302
And those are some of
your mother's best dishes,

52
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.523
so did you buy the paper
plates I asked you to?

53
00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:53.222
- Yes.
- Good.

54
00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:54.615
And make sure you tell everyone,

55
00:05:54.658 --> 00:05:56.356
no traipsing around the house

56
00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:58.749
after they get out of the hot
tub before they've toweled off.

57
00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:00.490
I know, it's cold, but guess what?

58
00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:02.318
I spent a lot of money
on those floors, so...

59
00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:07.323
God, yes, Sheila! I just
told him what you told me.

60
00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:12.850
Uh, just be really careful
with the plates, okay?

61
00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:15.462
I promise I've got
it all under control.

62
00:06:15.505 --> 00:06:18.247
All right, have fun.
Happy New Year.

63
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.381
Dad? Hello?

64
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.384
And we're out.

65
00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:31.782
I think I ate something.

66
00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:34.785
You're fine, babe.
Look, you always do this.

67
00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:37.962
I just don't wanna be sick
for the entire trip, you know?

68
00:06:38.006 --> 00:06:39.921
It's in your head,
you hypochondriac.

69
00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:41.792
Just relax!

70
00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:46.754
- Oh, this will do nicely.
- Oh, wow.

71
00:06:46.797 --> 00:06:48.408
How romantic.

72
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:50.627
Okay, yeah, no. We're gonna...
I don't... fucking gonna do that.

73
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:52.368
Oh.

74
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:56.372
Break it in later.

75
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:06.426
Alrighty, my friends. I
would like to make a toast.

76
00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:09.298
Dude, careful.

77
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:11.692
- Sorry. So...
- Floor, please.

78
00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:13.041
Okay.

79
00:07:13.084 --> 00:07:16.000
Without further ado...

80
00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:17.828
let's get fucked up!

81
00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:19.743
- Whoo!
- Oh, cheers.

82
00:07:19.787 --> 00:07:21.397
Okay. Oh.

83
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.573
Cheers.

84
00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:25.575
Mm.

85
00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:27.577
Ooh! Ooh!

86
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:28.970
- Another?
- Nuh-uh.

87
00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:30.580
- Let's do it, let's do it.
- Here we go.

88
00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:41.983
What the hell is that?

89
00:07:42.026 --> 00:07:44.159
I am building the best
snowman you've ever seen.

90
00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:46.422
That is
a very interesting snowman.

91
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.510
Well, I'm not done yet.

92
00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:50.382
Dude, watch it! Come on!

93
00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:52.863
Man, I don't want snow on my
face. Dude, I have asthma, seriously.

94
00:07:52.907 --> 00:07:54.343
Shut up.

95
00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:56.040
All right, fine,
I have no choice then.

96
00:07:56.084 --> 00:07:57.520
Okay, I hope this is
good content for you.

97
00:07:57.564 --> 00:07:59.609
- Come on.
- Are you really gonna film this now?

98
00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:01.089
Oh. Shit. Hey!

99
00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:02.612
- All right, get the shot you want.
- Dude, my phone.

100
00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.222
- Here... Point it this way.
- Calm down.

101
00:08:04.266 --> 00:08:06.877
What? Hey!

102
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.490
- Can I please finish my snowman?
- Fine.

103
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:22.414
- Hey.
- Yeah?

104
00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:28.029
I'm... I'm really sorry I
didn't make it to the funeral.

105
00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:29.204
Don't worry about it.

106
00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:34.209
- No, I should... I should have been there.
- Hey, really, it's okay.

107
00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:37.081
Nobody ever knows what to say.

108
00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:40.476
Honestly, I don't even know
what I want them to say.

109
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.738
Doesn't change anything.

110
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:46.613
- Canonball! Whoo!
- What? Oh!

111
00:08:47.744 --> 00:08:50.878
You guys, I'm kidding.

112
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.576
The towels. Don't lose them.

113
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.969
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Dad.

114
00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:56.448
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:01.018
- You guys were joking.
- Calm down. Oh.

116
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:04.892
- Yeah.
- Wow. Wow!

117
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:14.641
Coasters, please, you know?

118
00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:17.469
Okay. Dude, chill, okay?

119
00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:18.862
You're probably,
like, one of those weirdos

120
00:09:18.906 --> 00:09:21.212
who wears, like, two condoms
or something.

121
00:09:21.256 --> 00:09:22.605
If he ever had any sex.

122
00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:25.173
Very true.

123
00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:27.088
But we know he only has
eyes for one girl.

124
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.570
She's my best friend.

125
00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:32.441
Okay. Keep
tellin' yourself that.

126
00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:44.279
Dude, disconnect.

127
00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:47.587
Hey! Look, I have
11k followers now.

128
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.676
And only like a third
of them were bought.

129
00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:52.983
People expect to hear from me.

130
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.857
Uh, Jace, that bastard.

131
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:03.820
- There he is.
- Hey.

132
00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:07.345
Um, excuse me, I didn't ask to
be scheduled on New Year's Eve.

133
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:09.870
Yeah, no one's making you work.

134
00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:12.524
First of all, you know,
I don't really like camping

135
00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:16.964
and secondly, the amount of drunk
tips I'm gonna make tonight? Worth it.

136
00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:19.401
Plus, I heard there's, like,
a big storm headed your way.

137
00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:21.098
If I got stuck there
for an extra day,

138
00:10:21.142 --> 00:10:22.796
I would be fired for sure.

139
00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:25.233
I just think that you don't
wanna admit you have FOMO.

140
00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:26.669
I cannot confirm nor deny.

141
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:29.585
Hey, Eden, where you at?

142
00:10:32.153 --> 00:10:33.807
Hey, Jace.

143
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.547
- A round on me when you get back, okay?
- Sounds good.

144
00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:38.594
All right, you guys have fun.

145
00:10:39.377 --> 00:10:42.163
I wish I was there,
but I will see you back here

146
00:10:42.206 --> 00:10:45.906
whenever the snow gods
will it to be so, okay?

147
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:48.169
Don't drink too much.

148
00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:49.518
Or do, I don't care.

149
00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:51.955
- Bye.
- Bye.

150
00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:58.483
Well, on that note,
I say more shots.

151
00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:00.224
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

152
00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:02.749
- More shots.
- More shots.

153
00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.054
- Come on.
- Okay.

154
00:11:24.727 --> 00:11:27.121
- Shit! What?
- Oh, I... shit.

155
00:11:27.164 --> 00:11:29.601
I... I'm so sorry.
Here, watch the shoes.

156
00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:31.734
Okay, no.

157
00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:33.127
All right, well,

158
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.347
when we get home,
you're buying me a new one.

159
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:37.914
- Deal.
- Okay.

160
00:11:46.444 --> 00:11:48.055
So what's for dinner?

161
00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:50.100
Stir-fry,
and everyone's helping.

162
00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:51.841
Oh, you want me
to make the "rie"?

163
00:12:01.982 --> 00:12:05.942
Mm. Maybe I'm mixing
too much? I don't know.

164
00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:07.901
I just don't think it's normal

165
00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:10.251
that my stomach
is always this sensitive.

166
00:12:10.294 --> 00:12:14.298
Em, how many times do we all
have to assure you that you're fine?

167
00:12:14.342 --> 00:12:16.953
Trust me. Med student.

168
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:20.565
It's better
than self-diagnosing online.

169
00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:23.438
Em is constantly convincing
herself that she's dying.

170
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:24.874
I mean, to be fair,

171
00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:28.008
last week all my symptoms
pointed to cancer, so...

172
00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:36.146
I'm sorry, Eden. No, uh,
that was insensitive.

173
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.497
I know you didn't mean it.

174
00:12:42.326 --> 00:12:44.154
- Shit!
- Oh, what did you...

175
00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.503
Let me see.

176
00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:49.377
- Dammit.
- All right.

177
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.771
In my professional opinion,
I think you'll live.

178
00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:55.949
Okay. Well, Em, let
this be a lesson to you

179
00:12:55.992 --> 00:12:58.342
that men do not belong
in the kitchen.

180
00:12:58.386 --> 00:13:00.170
- Some of them do.
- I'm doin' a great job.

181
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:03.478
Yes. He did a great... great
job cutting all of that stuff.

182
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:05.393
Hmm, okay. Well, yay.

183
00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:07.699
- He's quite... kind of really professional.
- You can never.

184
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.225
Okay, guys, we have eight
seconds left till the ball drops.

185
00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:13.227
Seven, six,

186
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.796
five, four, three...

187
00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:21.626
...two, one. Happy New Year!

188
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.021
Yes, Happy New Year!

189
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:23.427
Hey. You good?

190
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:25.038
I'm good.

191
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.739
Nothing like New Year's Eve to
remind you of how single you are.

192
00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:35.875
I wasn't gonna ask, but, uh...

193
00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:38.878
where's your guy tonight?

194
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:42.490
Yeah, that guy?

195
00:14:44.144 --> 00:14:46.450
Yeah, what happened to him?

196
00:14:46.494 --> 00:14:48.888
Um...

197
00:14:48.931 --> 00:14:52.282
When my mom got sick,
he bolted, so...

198
00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:53.980
He couldn't deal.

199
00:14:55.677 --> 00:14:57.113
That's...

200
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.464
- That's shitty.
- Yep.

201
00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:06.035
I mean, thank God for you guys.

202
00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:07.732
Planning all this
just to cheer me up.

203
00:15:08.995 --> 00:15:10.866
I don't know what I did
to deserve...

204
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.086
- You guys, look outside.
- What?

205
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:16.611
Uh, dude, that's one
of my mom's favorite bowls.

206
00:15:16.654 --> 00:15:18.265
It'll be fine.

207
00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:19.788
Where are you going?

208
00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:33.019
It's really coming down.

209
00:15:34.846 --> 00:15:36.979
Oh, my God.
Okay, remember that...

210
00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:43.943
- Uh, what's that for?
- Alcoholic snow cones.

211
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:45.857
- What?
- I'm in.

212
00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:47.990
I'm in, whatever. Let's do it.

213
00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:57.173
Is this... sanitary?

214
00:15:57.217 --> 00:16:00.350
Sure it is, especially with the alcohol.

215
00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:01.482
Mm.

216
00:16:02.613 --> 00:16:03.571
Hmm.

217
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:07.096
A winter
storm warning is in effect

218
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.013
in and around the popular
skiing destination Snow Falls.

219
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:14.190
Weather forecasters are
predicting blizzard conditions,

220
00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:17.367
heavy snowfall,
and a bomb cyclone.

221
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:19.717
They are advising travelers
to be cautious

222
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:23.808
and prepare for delays as two
powerful back-to-back storms

223
00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:26.246
- produce widespread...
- Shit, that sounds kinda bad.

224
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:30.685
We may not be goin' home
tomorrow after all.

225
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:37.126
Well, on that note,
I'm gonna go to bed.

226
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.607
Is that code for "I'm gonna
go study in my room alone"?

227
00:16:42.349 --> 00:16:46.005
No, it's-it's code
for I'm gonna go sleep.

228
00:16:50.357 --> 00:16:51.532
Whatever.

229
00:18:24.973 --> 00:18:26.192
Sorry.

230
00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:28.455
Shit, sorry.

231
00:18:28.498 --> 00:18:32.111
It's... sorry, it's me.

232
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:34.722
- Hey, what... is the power out?
- Yeah.

233
00:18:34.765 --> 00:18:36.941
Uh, I went to check
the backup genny,

234
00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:39.509
but, uh, we're out of gas.

235
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:42.251
Holy shit.

236
00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:45.820
Dude, shut up.
It's part of the process.

237
00:18:45.863 --> 00:18:49.432
Okay, do you think the power
will be back on soon?

238
00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:52.392
I'm sure, it's never been out
for more than a day or so.

239
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.526
Wait, so what are we
gonna do about heat?

240
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:02.489
Uh, maybe a good idea
to gather in one area,

241
00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:04.926
like the living room, fireside,

242
00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:08.451
and I'll close the vents,
don't let the cold air in.

243
00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:10.627
If we have to, we can stuff
towels in the base of the doors.

244
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:13.761
Yeah? Sound like a plan?

245
00:19:13.804 --> 00:19:15.371
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

246
00:19:15.415 --> 00:19:16.807
- Okay.
- Shut up.

247
00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:19.462
Come on.

248
00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:50.624
Oh!

249
00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:51.973
Wakey-wakey, friends!

250
00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:53.801
Kit!

251
00:19:53.844 --> 00:19:56.456
The roads may be out of commission,
but that doesn't mean we are.

252
00:19:56.499 --> 00:19:59.720
Come on, wake up.

253
00:19:59.763 --> 00:20:01.548
- Dude, what you doing?
- Wake up.

254
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:03.202
But the couch, seriously.

255
00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:12.385
I walked all the way to the road
tryin' to get service.

256
00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:13.690
No luck.

257
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:18.260
We should really use the
firewood sparingly, there's not much.

258
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.613
You can't even see the road.

259
00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:27.356
Yeah. We're not goin' anywhere.

260
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:39.063
What could you possibly
be doing right now?

261
00:20:39.107 --> 00:20:41.370
I'm face-tuning selfies.

262
00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:43.851
If there's no service or Wi-Fi,
I gotta use my time wisely.

263
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:47.855
"Wisely."

264
00:20:47.898 --> 00:20:50.945
I mean, how do you
put up with him?

265
00:20:50.988 --> 00:20:52.207
I mean, I... I love him and all,

266
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.688
but, I mean,
he loves himself a lot.

267
00:20:56.037 --> 00:20:59.083
Well, he puts up with my shit.
It's hard to find.

268
00:21:00.868 --> 00:21:04.306
No! Do you have to film
everything?

269
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.310
I mean, Em doesn't let me
film everything.

270
00:21:08.354 --> 00:21:10.138
Oh, Andy spilled the tea.

271
00:21:11.574 --> 00:21:13.184
Where did he spill it?

272
00:21:19.147 --> 00:21:22.281
What? Oh, okay.

273
00:21:32.813 --> 00:21:34.989
Guys, it's-it's dark outside.

274
00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:36.295
What are we gonna do for light?

275
00:21:37.383 --> 00:21:41.082
Oh, right. I mean,
do you guys have any candles?

276
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:43.519
Yeah, my parents
have a lot of candles.

277
00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:46.566
Uh, I think lanterns,
some more flashlights.

278
00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:48.089
Okay, great.

279
00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:50.700
Then let's, um,
let's light this place up.

280
00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:19.686
I'm freezing.

281
00:22:21.383 --> 00:22:24.038
Yeah, when do you think
the power will come back on?

282
00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:26.954
I thought it would be by now.

283
00:22:26.997 --> 00:22:30.261
Maybe we could siphon the gas
from the cars for the generator.

284
00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:33.613
Mm, I don't think so.

285
00:22:33.656 --> 00:22:36.093
I mean, we'll need it to leave
when the snow clears.

286
00:22:36.137 --> 00:22:40.010
If. If it clears.

287
00:22:40.054 --> 00:22:42.665
Okay, now
who's the paranoid one?

288
00:22:45.189 --> 00:22:48.367
Maybe we should stop drinking.

289
00:22:49.977 --> 00:22:51.892
Most people think that booze
will keep you warmer,

290
00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:54.155
but, in reality,
it does the opposite,

291
00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:58.202
and alcohol prevents your body
from lots of its healthy reflexes,

292
00:22:58.246 --> 00:23:01.380
one of which is keeping the core body
temperature warm in colder weather.

293
00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:05.558
Screw that.

294
00:23:24.707 --> 00:23:27.014
Sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you up.

295
00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:36.850
I dream about my mom sometimes.

296
00:23:39.983 --> 00:23:43.596
I miss her. A lot.

297
00:23:48.731 --> 00:23:50.429
I'm cold.

298
00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:54.563
Me, too.

299
00:23:56.478 --> 00:24:00.787
No, I mean, I am freezing, but...

300
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.097
That's actually the last thing
she said to me in the hospital.

301
00:24:10.797 --> 00:24:12.233
"I'm cold."

302
00:24:17.325 --> 00:24:21.242
Now it just... feels
like a weird coincidence.

303
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:35.256
Hey.

304
00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:40.870
I can't take this anymore.

305
00:24:42.742 --> 00:24:45.048
Let's try something. Come on.

306
00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:54.928
Come on.

307
00:25:02.283 --> 00:25:04.024
Okay, for body heat, right?

308
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.744
There's no luck.

309
00:25:28.788 --> 00:25:31.704
Look, we walked a while,
the roads are really bad.

310
00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:33.488
There's no way a car
is gonna make it.

311
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:37.187
Yeah, you guys,
there's... "snow" way out.

312
00:25:38.885 --> 00:25:41.583
Come on. Okay, I got one more.

313
00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:43.759
The snow has fallen
and it can't get up.

314
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:47.720
You're an idiot.

315
00:25:47.763 --> 00:25:50.897
Okay, it's getting colder.
The house isn't holding heat.

316
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.899
Yeah, and we're
almost out of firewood.

317
00:26:22.711 --> 00:26:26.149
Is-is this
all the dry wood we have?

318
00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:32.025
Right, we're low on food, too.
We need to ration what we've got.

319
00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:36.551
Hey, why don't we cut up
some furniture and burn that?

320
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.248
Don't even think about it.

321
00:26:38.292 --> 00:26:40.250
I mean, come on, man.

322
00:26:40.294 --> 00:26:42.557
Your parents would rather you
destroy a side table than freeze to death.

323
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:45.516
Nobody is gonna freeze
to death, okay?

324
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.649
Look, we need to do two things.

325
00:26:47.693 --> 00:26:50.783
First, we need to stay
as warm as possible.

326
00:26:50.826 --> 00:26:52.306
There's a few ways
we can do that.

327
00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:54.438
Sticking by the fire
is obviously ideal

328
00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:55.701
and I have a few hand warmers.

329
00:26:55.744 --> 00:26:57.441
And, uh, water
that was already hot

330
00:26:57.485 --> 00:26:58.878
by the time
the-the power went out,

331
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:01.750
it should still be warm
in the tank for a little while.

332
00:27:01.794 --> 00:27:04.840
And I turned off the heat, uh, the
power and the water supply to the heater,

333
00:27:04.884 --> 00:27:06.929
just to keep what's left
as warm as possible.

334
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:08.670
Yeah, and I-I've done
this camping before,

335
00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:10.541
where you put
hot water in a-in a bottle

336
00:27:10.585 --> 00:27:12.979
and you put it at your feet
in your sleeping bag

337
00:27:13.022 --> 00:27:16.069
or under your blanket.
Really works.

338
00:27:19.942 --> 00:27:22.728
Um, secondly,

339
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:26.645
and, um, this might be
difficult...

340
00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:31.911
we need to stay awake.

341
00:27:31.954 --> 00:27:33.303
Why?

342
00:27:35.218 --> 00:27:37.656
Because when hypothermia
sets in...

343
00:27:38.961 --> 00:27:41.094
most times,
if you fall asleep...

344
00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:44.575
you won't wake up.

345
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:11.907
Hey, hey.

346
00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:14.562
- You up?
- Yeah.

347
00:28:56.647 --> 00:28:59.650
Yeah. Should give us
a little bit more heat...

348
00:28:59.694 --> 00:29:01.827
when it's sunny.

349
00:29:12.228 --> 00:29:14.448
Could've swore we had
more groceries than this.

350
00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:18.844
Hey, sugar isn't a good idea.

351
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:21.890
Well, it's to stay awake.

352
00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:24.675
And it'll give you
a quick burst of energy,

353
00:29:24.719 --> 00:29:26.895
but then you'll crash.

354
00:29:29.202 --> 00:29:33.336
- Kit, come on.
- Frosty, the snow bitch.

355
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.950
Told you. It'll only
make it worse.

356
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.649
Kit.

357
00:29:41.692 --> 00:29:44.652
Don't you take adde for ADD?

358
00:29:44.695 --> 00:29:47.046
Have you met him? Of
course he does.

359
00:29:49.483 --> 00:29:50.832
That's a good idea.

360
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.240
I'm freezing.

361
00:30:08.763 --> 00:30:10.330
I can hardly feel my hands.

362
00:30:12.723 --> 00:30:16.162
Hey, you know,
with most gas stoves,

363
00:30:16.205 --> 00:30:18.207
you could just ignite it
with a match.

364
00:30:49.978 --> 00:30:52.502
Oh! Yes, yes.

365
00:30:52.546 --> 00:30:54.983
Hey! Feels really good.

366
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:18.267
Kit! Kit, what are you doing?!

367
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:26.754
What were you thinking? Guys!

368
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:53.955
...the winter storm
is bringing snow, sleet, and ice

369
00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:56.958
along with hundreds
of flight cancellations...

370
00:31:57.002 --> 00:31:59.874
...road conditions.
It's fixing up to be

371
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:03.356
one of the worst snow storms
to hit in quite some time.

372
00:32:07.186 --> 00:32:08.448
My last one.

373
00:32:12.147 --> 00:32:13.801
Okay, listen,

374
00:32:13.844 --> 00:32:17.674
I know that Kit isn't the
only one feeling a little off.

375
00:32:17.718 --> 00:32:21.069
Cold's gettin' to me, too.

376
00:32:21.113 --> 00:32:22.288
Plus, we aren't sleeping.

377
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.769
Fire is officially dead.

378
00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:29.904
What if it's the snow?

379
00:32:31.253 --> 00:32:32.820
What do you mean?

380
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:38.347
I mean, think about it.

381
00:32:38.391 --> 00:32:41.089
How many movies have you seen
where, like, virus spreads

382
00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:43.004
or, like, a zombie plague,

383
00:32:43.048 --> 00:32:46.007
because the water supply
is tainted?

384
00:32:46.051 --> 00:32:47.226
Oh, shit.

385
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.795
Right? I mean, uh,
what if the snow is...

386
00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:55.103
I don't know,
somehow contaminated?

387
00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:57.976
Didn't... didn't we pass the water
treatment plant on the way up here?

388
00:32:58.019 --> 00:33:02.415
Maybe. Uh, and I think there's
a military base not far from here.

389
00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:06.027
Okay, stop, calm down.
I don't think that's it.

390
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:08.464
You guys sound
like conspiracy theorists.

391
00:33:12.207 --> 00:33:14.862
- We ate it.
- What?

392
00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.955
We... ate the snow, all of us.

393
00:33:26.308 --> 00:33:31.400
My... my stomach, I... I knew
that it was starting to feel worse.

394
00:33:31.444 --> 00:33:35.970
No, no, babe. Look. you... you
always do this, you know that.

395
00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.799
You get in your head and
you ruin things for yourself.

396
00:33:38.842 --> 00:33:40.366
Think about it.

397
00:33:40.409 --> 00:33:42.063
You were excited for this trip.

398
00:33:43.934 --> 00:33:47.112
Shit. Don't worry.

399
00:33:48.983 --> 00:33:50.680
I'm sure we're all fine.

400
00:34:25.237 --> 00:34:27.239
It was facing
the other way before.

401
00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:43.820
Guys...

402
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.740
the snowman, I think it's...

403
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:07.148
Dude, are you okay?

404
00:35:07.192 --> 00:35:09.933
- I... I thought, uh...
- What?

405
00:35:12.284 --> 00:35:15.417
Are you guys messing with me?

406
00:35:15.461 --> 00:35:18.594
Of course not. Why
would you even ask that?

407
00:35:32.173 --> 00:35:33.566
- Hey.
- Hmm?

408
00:35:35.437 --> 00:35:37.787
Do you think it's possible?

409
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:38.832
What?

410
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:40.834
The snow.

411
00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:46.100
I think we're all
sleep-deprived,

412
00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:48.233
probably a little bit
hypothermic.

413
00:35:48.276 --> 00:35:50.191
Symptoms of both
would make sense here.

414
00:35:51.584 --> 00:35:54.239
Yeah, right.

415
00:36:13.519 --> 00:36:14.694
I have an idea.

416
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.353
Why don't we say
our resolutions?

417
00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:26.880
It doesn't really feel
like the appropriate time.

418
00:36:28.577 --> 00:36:30.666
No.

419
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.148
No, he's right.
It'd be a good exercise.

420
00:36:35.628 --> 00:36:38.065
Speaking of exercise, um,

421
00:36:38.108 --> 00:36:42.287
my resolution is to make it
to the gym six times a week,

422
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.941
get below 8% body fat.

423
00:36:46.508 --> 00:36:48.293
It's heartwarming.

424
00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:50.512
I'll go.

425
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:57.824
My New Year's resolution
is to survive.

426
00:36:59.913 --> 00:37:01.306
I'll second that.

427
00:37:03.786 --> 00:37:05.701
Well, while we all agree there,

428
00:37:05.745 --> 00:37:07.877
it's a lazy answer.

429
00:37:08.878 --> 00:37:10.097
Then you go.

430
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.015
Mine is to graduate.

431
00:37:15.058 --> 00:37:17.409
I mean, now that my mom is gone,

432
00:37:17.452 --> 00:37:20.542
my career path
feels even more important.

433
00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:21.891
I wanna make her proud.

434
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:26.592
- That's a good one.
- Thanks.

435
00:37:28.376 --> 00:37:29.812
What about you, River?

436
00:37:31.074 --> 00:37:33.251
What's your New Year's
resolution?

437
00:37:37.342 --> 00:37:39.344
To get away from you people.

438
00:38:18.905 --> 00:38:20.602
Em?

439
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:27.087
Hey, have you guys seen Em?

440
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.655
I dozed off and she wasn't
there when I woke up.

441
00:38:42.755 --> 00:38:43.886
Oh, my God.

442
00:38:49.979 --> 00:38:51.067
Em!

443
00:38:58.118 --> 00:38:59.511
Bring her right here.

444
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:06.779
Okay, everybody back up.

445
00:39:06.822 --> 00:39:08.694
Any excessive
or jarring movement

446
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:10.913
could-could trigger
a cardiac arrest, okay?

447
00:39:10.957 --> 00:39:12.611
We don't know how long
she's been out there.

448
00:39:12.654 --> 00:39:15.309
I'm here, Em. I'm here.

449
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.137
We need to get
these damp clothes off her.

450
00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.966
Gently, okay?
Start with the shoes, yes.

451
00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:27.713
Hey.

452
00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:42.641
Hey, how you feelin'?

453
00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:47.341
My stomach hurts.

454
00:39:52.868 --> 00:39:53.782
River.

455
00:39:54.783 --> 00:39:55.610
Oh.

456
00:39:56.698 --> 00:39:58.526
You don't look so good.

457
00:39:59.832 --> 00:40:01.399
I'm feeling a little...

458
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.445
sick.

459
00:40:07.709 --> 00:40:10.669
I keep thinking about the snow.

460
00:40:11.931 --> 00:40:13.367
What about it?

461
00:40:15.238 --> 00:40:18.938
About it being... bad.

462
00:40:21.462 --> 00:40:24.857
About there being
something in it.

463
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:36.085
Eden... can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a minute?

464
00:40:36.129 --> 00:40:38.958
Yeah. I'll be right back, River.

465
00:40:43.484 --> 00:40:44.877
I'll be right back, okay?

466
00:41:02.068 --> 00:41:03.852
I asked her why she did it.

467
00:41:05.027 --> 00:41:07.856
Why she... why she went outside?

468
00:41:10.555 --> 00:41:13.427
She said it was because
it was warm out there.

469
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.693
She was confused, hallucinating.

470
00:41:20.042 --> 00:41:22.871
This goes beyond a
little more than discomfort,

471
00:41:22.915 --> 00:41:24.351
little shivering and fatigue.

472
00:41:25.352 --> 00:41:28.224
Em is literally losing her mind.

473
00:41:28.268 --> 00:41:30.270
She's obsessed with
this idea about the snow.

474
00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:33.578
Yeah, and River's
pretty convinced of it too.

475
00:41:35.231 --> 00:41:36.755
I didn't even think
he was, like, serious

476
00:41:36.798 --> 00:41:38.147
when he came up
with that theory.

477
00:41:38.191 --> 00:41:41.107
That's how mass hysteria works.

478
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.850
People feeding off
of each other's suggestions,

479
00:41:44.893 --> 00:41:48.331
literally making themselves
sick over getting sick.

480
00:41:48.375 --> 00:41:53.815
Plus, we're all tired
and cold, so...

481
00:41:55.643 --> 00:41:59.778
Hypothermia can cause
bizarre, risk-taking behavior

482
00:41:59.821 --> 00:42:02.476
because of confusion
and disorientation.

483
00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:05.740
And hunger doesn't help,

484
00:42:05.784 --> 00:42:08.787
not to mention the effects
of little to no sleep.

485
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:14.619
Have you guys heard of the
Russian sleep experiment?

486
00:42:14.662 --> 00:42:16.882
- What's that?
- It's an urban legend.

487
00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:22.017
Apparently, it was an
experiment on sleep deprivation.

488
00:42:23.845 --> 00:42:25.238
In the '40s,

489
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:27.588
there were five prisoners
who were put into a room

490
00:42:27.632 --> 00:42:33.028
that was pumped full of this
stimulant gas to keep them awake.

491
00:42:33.072 --> 00:42:35.422
After only a few days,

492
00:42:35.465 --> 00:42:38.556
they were whispering
to themselves,

493
00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:42.342
turning on each other,
showing signs of paranoia.

494
00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:47.260
And when one of them was screaming
so loud he tore his vocal cords,

495
00:42:47.303 --> 00:42:48.783
the rest of them
didn't even blink.

496
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.614
By the end of it, they were chewing
their fingers down to the bone,

497
00:42:53.658 --> 00:42:56.095
literally feeding on themselves.

498
00:42:56.138 --> 00:42:58.793
Why are you
telling us this story?

499
00:42:58.837 --> 00:43:03.276
I'm just driving home the point
that there's no evil snow.

500
00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:05.800
We're all just run-down.

501
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:11.153
But I am realizing that we
may need to make a move soon.

502
00:43:13.025 --> 00:43:14.461
What kind of a move?

503
00:43:16.637 --> 00:43:18.030
The generator.

504
00:43:19.379 --> 00:43:21.033
No more waiting,
no more freezing.

505
00:43:22.338 --> 00:43:23.426
Em is sick.

506
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:26.473
We siphon the gas from our car.

507
00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.433
- I agree.
- Yeah, me too.

508
00:43:30.477 --> 00:43:32.087
Me as well.

509
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.485
How about I go to the shed,
look for a siphon,

510
00:43:38.528 --> 00:43:39.791
let you know once I found it?

511
00:43:41.096 --> 00:43:42.707
Yeah, thanks, River.

512
00:44:03.031 --> 00:44:05.033
He's been out there for a while.

513
00:44:06.513 --> 00:44:07.514
Yeah.

514
00:44:08.558 --> 00:44:11.083
He was acting kinda funny
earlier, don't you think?

515
00:44:13.259 --> 00:44:16.262
Yeah, maybe I'll go
check on him.

516
00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:20.875
Thank you.

517
00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:31.799
River!

518
00:44:35.847 --> 00:44:37.283
Where are you, man?

519
00:44:54.039 --> 00:44:57.216
- What the hell are you doing?
- We can't spread it.

520
00:44:57.259 --> 00:44:58.608
Spread what?

521
00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:00.872
The virus or whatever it is.

522
00:45:02.438 --> 00:45:03.744
There is no virus.

523
00:45:06.529 --> 00:45:08.488
What have you done?

524
00:45:08.531 --> 00:45:10.229
We have to die.

525
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.101
It has to die with us.

526
00:45:14.102 --> 00:45:15.451
We can't leave here.

527
00:45:22.328 --> 00:45:24.069
- Tell them!
- What is going on?

528
00:45:24.112 --> 00:45:27.594
You screwed up! He poured out
all the gas, all of it!

529
00:45:27.637 --> 00:45:30.336
- What the hell?
- River, why would you do that?

530
00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:32.555
Dammit, he's covered in gas!

531
00:45:40.389 --> 00:45:43.218
- What are you thinking?
- I...

532
00:45:45.003 --> 00:45:46.482
I'm sorry, guys. I don't...

533
00:45:47.614 --> 00:45:49.224
Uh, I'm feeling a little...

534
00:45:51.618 --> 00:45:54.142
You're just confused, okay?

535
00:45:54.186 --> 00:45:55.753
We're your friends.

536
00:45:57.058 --> 00:45:59.234
I know. I...

537
00:45:59.278 --> 00:46:01.193
You don't wanna hurt us.

538
00:46:01.236 --> 00:46:03.325
I know, I...

539
00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:05.501
I don't know what came over me.

540
00:46:39.274 --> 00:46:41.276
Oh, my God. Em's gone.

541
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:02.994
Em?

542
00:47:03.037 --> 00:47:05.039
Babe, are... are you okay?

543
00:47:06.998 --> 00:47:08.434
I'm f-I'm fine.

544
00:47:08.477 --> 00:47:10.828
Just... just leave me alone.

545
00:47:15.397 --> 00:47:17.269
Babe, you're scaring me
a little.

546
00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:20.707
Just open the door, okay?

547
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.666
Em?

548
00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:45.558
Open the door.

549
00:47:45.601 --> 00:47:47.212
Open the door, Em.

550
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:03.097
Em?

551
00:48:11.671 --> 00:48:14.021
Babe, just... just open up, okay?

552
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.683
Okay, if you're in
there, back up. I'm coming in.

553
00:48:33.127 --> 00:48:34.433
Oh, my God.

554
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:39.351
What-what are you doing?

555
00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:51.189
I think I got it.
I think I got it out.

556
00:48:57.978 --> 00:48:59.414
No, that's deep.

557
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:01.416
Thankfully, I don't think
she perforated her stomach,

558
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.767
but I need to close her up fast.

559
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.640
There's a first-aid kit
in my bag.

560
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.208
I'll do my best.

561
00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:23.438
Hey, buddy, what you doin'?

562
00:49:25.179 --> 00:49:28.182
Cleaning. My Mom will flip.

563
00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:33.666
Don't you think we have more important
things to worry about at this point?

564
00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:40.978
I mean, you're down
on your knees

565
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:42.631
scrubbing one of your best
friend's blood.

566
00:49:49.943 --> 00:49:51.510
Yeah, you're right.

567
00:49:53.512 --> 00:49:55.514
I'm not thinking clearly,
I guess.

568
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:33.726
Asshole.

569
00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:01.754
She can't last long like this.

570
00:51:04.148 --> 00:51:05.888
We can try to keep her warm
and comfortable,

571
00:51:05.932 --> 00:51:09.414
but I can only do so much.
She needs a real hospital.

572
00:51:15.898 --> 00:51:17.074
How's River?

573
00:51:18.205 --> 00:51:19.859
Uh...

574
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:23.732
At the moment, he seems okay.

575
00:51:26.866 --> 00:51:28.781
I don't understand
how it happened...

576
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.479
how he changed that fast.

577
00:51:31.523 --> 00:51:35.135
He was... normal last night.

578
00:51:40.706 --> 00:51:42.490
You know, I never finished
telling you my story

579
00:51:42.534 --> 00:51:44.536
about the Russian
sleep experiment.

580
00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:46.842
Okay.

581
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.545
When the prisoners were
finally told that they could leave...

582
00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:57.723
the researchers heard
this quiet voice

583
00:51:57.766 --> 00:52:00.552
over the microphone
they used to monitor them.

584
00:52:03.207 --> 00:52:06.645
It said, "We no longer
want to be free."

585
00:52:08.037 --> 00:52:12.433
River was willing
to sacrifice himself and us...

586
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:15.871
for a hallucination.

587
00:52:18.352 --> 00:52:20.354
And Em cut herself open.

588
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.752
It doesn't matter if any
of this is actually real.

589
00:52:29.189 --> 00:52:31.800
The danger is real.

590
00:52:49.557 --> 00:52:50.950
Are you feeling better?

591
00:52:54.127 --> 00:52:55.476
I think so.

592
00:52:57.043 --> 00:52:59.176
I think my head's
just a little mixed up.

593
00:53:02.266 --> 00:53:04.093
I think I know
why you're feeling better.

594
00:53:05.573 --> 00:53:08.228
I found the stash in your bag.

595
00:53:10.578 --> 00:53:12.928
- Shit.
- Hey, I get it.

596
00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:17.150
We're all scared,
we're all hungry...

597
00:53:18.804 --> 00:53:21.894
but you can't hoard
our groceries for yourself.

598
00:53:27.813 --> 00:53:30.207
I took it because...

599
00:53:32.426 --> 00:53:34.211
Well, in case,
we ran out of food...

600
00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:38.650
I was planning on...

601
00:53:38.693 --> 00:53:40.173
I was planning
on sharing it with you.

602
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:43.959
I'm sorry, I...

603
00:53:45.047 --> 00:53:46.223
I'm sorry, I'll...

604
00:53:47.136 --> 00:53:48.747
I'll share with everyone.

605
00:53:51.053 --> 00:53:55.014
If you don't feed the mind,
it'll start feeding on itself.

606
00:53:55.057 --> 00:53:58.409
I think we'll all think a little
clearer with food in our systems.

607
00:53:58.452 --> 00:54:01.238
Yeah.

608
00:54:06.982 --> 00:54:09.289
What... What is he...

609
00:54:15.774 --> 00:54:17.558
Dude, what are you doing?

610
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:21.736
We need firewood, River.

611
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.999
But that's an antique!

612
00:54:24.043 --> 00:54:27.002
Em is dying!
I have to warm her up!

613
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:28.308
Stop!

614
00:54:28.352 --> 00:54:29.657
Look, we're freezing here

615
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:31.703
and it's because of you
that we have no gas!

616
00:54:31.746 --> 00:54:33.748
I told you not to do that.

617
00:54:43.845 --> 00:54:45.369
Em.

618
00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:52.854
Andy.

619
00:54:52.898 --> 00:54:54.595
Andy, dude, wake up.

620
00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:01.994
Andy, du-dude, wake up.

621
00:55:02.037 --> 00:55:04.039
Get the fuck off.

622
00:55:11.525 --> 00:55:12.961
Baby...

623
00:55:14.354 --> 00:55:15.921
You killed him!

624
00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:19.794
I... I didn't mean to.

625
00:55:19.838 --> 00:55:22.057
No...

626
00:55:27.672 --> 00:55:28.977
Em!

627
00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:35.506
- I...
- No.

628
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.555
I...

629
00:55:43.165 --> 00:55:46.168
I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

630
00:55:56.962 --> 00:56:00.226
I didn't mean to.

631
00:56:08.321 --> 00:56:11.368
Oh... Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

632
00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:22.248
Oh, my God, Jace!

633
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:24.293
I've been trying to get ahold
of you guys for days!

634
00:56:24.337 --> 00:56:26.687
Yeah, yeah, we're snowed in,
and the power is all out,

635
00:56:26.731 --> 00:56:29.342
and it's... it's freezing. Oh, my
God, I can't believe there's service.

636
00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:31.779
I called for help.
Someone's comin' to get you.

637
00:56:31.823 --> 00:56:33.955
Oh, my God! Thank God.

638
00:56:33.999 --> 00:56:36.393
Guys! Guys,
Jace is on the phone!

639
00:56:36.436 --> 00:56:37.568
I'm cold.

640
00:56:39.483 --> 00:56:41.441
- What did you just say?
- I'm cold.

641
00:56:46.098 --> 00:56:47.491
Jace, wait, one second!

642
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.498
What's wrong?

643
00:56:54.541 --> 00:56:55.977
- Oh.
- What?

644
00:56:56.021 --> 00:56:57.762
Uh, Jace... Jace is on the phone.

645
00:56:59.198 --> 00:57:03.724
It's... it's impossible,
there's-there's no service.

646
00:57:03.768 --> 00:57:05.857
No, I was just talking to him.
The call must have dropped.

647
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.251
Eden, your phone's dead.

648
00:57:11.776 --> 00:57:12.951
It's...

649
00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:19.044
Oh, I don't like this feeling.
Like I'm...

650
00:57:19.087 --> 00:57:20.524
- It's okay.
- Like I'm foggy.

651
00:57:20.567 --> 00:57:24.092
Come on, Eden.
You're a medical professional,

652
00:57:24.136 --> 00:57:26.573
- trained to deal with high-stress situations...
- Come on.

653
00:57:26.617 --> 00:57:29.489
...with a smile and without
losing your damn mind.

654
00:57:31.317 --> 00:57:33.188
Come on, okay?

655
00:57:33.232 --> 00:57:36.104
We can't leave River down
there with Em alone, all right?

656
00:57:36.148 --> 00:57:37.802
Come on.

657
00:57:49.988 --> 00:57:52.730
Thanks for sharing
the wealth, dick.

658
00:57:52.773 --> 00:57:54.775
I said I was sorry.

659
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.258
We shouldn't let her stay
like that for long.

660
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:01.086
He's gonna start to smell soon.

661
00:58:02.435 --> 00:58:04.437
Maybe not in this cold.

662
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:10.443
Andy was one of my best friends.

663
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:17.929
- I didn't mean to.
- Hey, hey, I know that.

664
00:58:17.972 --> 00:58:19.974
Em does, too.

665
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:24.718
I have to go for help.

666
00:58:27.765 --> 00:58:30.332
You-you mean on foot?

667
00:58:30.376 --> 00:58:32.421
Kit, you'll freeze out there.

668
00:58:33.597 --> 00:58:35.512
You guys, what other
choice do we have?

669
00:58:37.165 --> 00:58:38.732
Okay? Andy's dead.

670
00:58:40.734 --> 00:58:44.303
Em, she's... she's really
hurt and she's lost it.

671
00:58:48.307 --> 00:58:50.439
And River, um, no offense,

672
00:58:50.483 --> 00:58:54.052
but... you're
kind of a wild card, too.

673
00:59:45.799 --> 00:59:48.106
I swear, something grabbed me.

674
00:59:48.149 --> 00:59:49.237
Okay.

675
00:59:51.065 --> 00:59:52.240
Be careful, please.

676
01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:05.645
- Kit, there's nothing there.
- I saw it.

677
01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:08.126
I know. I know the feeling.

678
01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.356
Are you sure about this?

679
01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:25.709
Yeah, I'm sure.

680
01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:29.277
I've lost enough people, Kit.

681
01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:30.583
Maybe it's not a good idea.

682
01:00:34.152 --> 01:00:36.676
You know how I'm always,
like, joking around?

683
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:42.682
But the truth is, I am
scared as shit right now.

684
01:00:45.293 --> 01:00:48.079
But that doesn't change the
fact that I know I have to try.

685
01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:51.822
Good luck.

686
01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:32.514
I don't think she'll come
after you again. Okay?

687
01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:36.431
I'm not even sure if she'll
make it through the night.

688
01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:49.357
The bandage isn't working.

689
01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:02.980
It won't stop bleeding.

690
01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:11.075
I can't stop the shivering.

691
01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:27.656
Maybe there's just a
little juice left in the car.

692
01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:32.531
Okay? Just enough
to turn the heater on.

693
01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:37.014
Just a little bit.

694
01:03:30.545 --> 01:03:34.680
Oh, yes.

695
01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:36.247
Oh.

696
01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.204
Oh. Yeah.

697
01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:39.337
Oh, my God, baby.

698
01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.904
Baby, it's working.

699
01:03:41.948 --> 01:03:43.689
- You were right.
- It worked.

700
01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:54.526
Oh, it feels so good.

701
01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.878
I love you, baby.

702
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.577
I love you, too.

703
01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:32.433
Thank God, the pipes
haven't frozen over yet.

704
01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:35.872
Well...

705
01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:42.443
- Good news.
- Hmm?

706
01:04:42.487 --> 01:04:44.576
I'm willing to part
with my mother's antiques.

707
01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.970
Hmm, personal growth.
I'm all for it.

708
01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:54.020
What?

709
01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:58.329
Hey, where's Em?

710
01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:05.249
Em?

711
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.775
- Em?
- What's that sound?

712
01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:15.302
Oh, my God. Is she in the car?

713
01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:25.922
Em...

714
01:05:28.446 --> 01:05:31.797
Em, wake up.

715
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.190
Eden.

716
01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:10.357
You sure you wanna come?

717
01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:13.534
Yeah, I'm worried
about Kit, too.

718
01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:17.843
Plus, I can't let you go alone.

719
01:06:19.192 --> 01:06:20.367
Okay.

720
01:06:58.405 --> 01:06:59.450
Kit.

721
01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:04.063
- Is he...
- No.

722
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:23.909
Why did he do that?

723
01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:29.741
It's, um...
It's called something...

724
01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:33.397
Um, paradoxical undressing.

725
01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.009
I remember it
being really common

726
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.272
in people dying
from hypothermia.

727
01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:44.060
They strip off all their
clothes, like they're burning up.

728
01:08:06.778 --> 01:08:08.910
But in actuality,
they're freezing.

729
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:36.938
What now?

730
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:43.336
We get the fire going again,
finish off your snacks, and then...

731
01:08:45.947 --> 01:08:47.906
I mean, this is
all we have left.

732
01:08:51.039 --> 01:08:52.345
You have it.

733
01:08:53.346 --> 01:08:55.348
Hey, we can share.

734
01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:04.792
Why are you so good to me?

735
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.839
You know why.

736
01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:12.191
Because we're friends?

737
01:09:16.282 --> 01:09:19.938
Yeah. Friends.

738
01:09:25.465 --> 01:09:29.077
Hey, that looks like a good
firewood candidate.

739
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:31.079
Yeah. Yeah.

740
01:09:31.123 --> 01:09:33.778
At least, we'll be warm
when we starve to death.

741
01:09:33.821 --> 01:09:36.824
Hey, no one's starving to death.

742
01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:42.265
- I'll go get the axe.
- Hmm.

743
01:10:14.645 --> 01:10:16.168
River...

744
01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:24.307
Come here.

745
01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:30.269
What are you
doing? You're gonna freeze.

746
01:10:30.313 --> 01:10:31.618
Come on.

747
01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:45.241
Hurry.

748
01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:09.569
Doesn't a hot shower sound nice?

749
01:12:00.707 --> 01:12:02.187
River?

750
01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:22.294
River!

751
01:12:42.488 --> 01:12:44.142
Oh, River!

752
01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:49.190
Oh, my God, River!
What are you thinking?!

753
01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:53.151
What... what are you doing?

754
01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:01.899
I... I... I...

755
01:13:01.942 --> 01:13:06.033
I wish... I wish...
We could have t... tried...

756
01:13:09.602 --> 01:13:11.909
Hang in there.
Hang in there, River.

757
01:13:11.952 --> 01:13:13.998
You're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be okay.

758
01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:15.913
I wanna s-sleep.

759
01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:17.175
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

760
01:13:17.218 --> 01:13:18.437
you're not gonna do that
right now.

761
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:20.178
Keep your eyes open, okay?
I'm... I'm here.

762
01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:21.527
I'm gonna warm you up, okay?

763
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:23.137
Don't worry.

764
01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:26.445
You're gonna be fine.

765
01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:31.494
You... you have to... to survive.

766
01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:34.975
No, no, please,
River, don't say that.

767
01:13:35.019 --> 01:13:36.760
River, please.

768
01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:39.240
No, no.

769
01:13:45.072 --> 01:13:47.423
River, please. Please, wake up.

770
01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:19.890
River, the power's back.
The power's back.

771
01:14:19.933 --> 01:14:21.152
We're gonna be okay.

772
01:14:22.153 --> 01:14:23.154
We're gonna be okay.

773
01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:36.210
Sit here.

774
01:14:39.257 --> 01:14:42.565
Sit right here
and wait for help.

775
01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.044
We made it.

776
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:46.960
Happy New Year.

777
01:15:00.017 --> 01:15:02.846
I've arrived on the property.
Yes, I already see a young woman.

778
01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:04.935
Alive.

779
01:15:08.852 --> 01:15:11.158
Ma'am, are there
any other survivors?

780
01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:13.073
Just us.

781
01:15:13.117 --> 01:15:14.553
Us?

782
01:15:16.294 --> 01:15:17.513
Yeah.

783
01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:20.951
Me and River.
