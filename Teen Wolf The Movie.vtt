00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:21.493
When is a door not a door?

2
00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:22.858
Sorry?

3
00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:26.492
When is a door not a door?

4
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.824
She doesn't understand.

5
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.057
Well, it's a riddle.

6
00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:34.557
I think she understands
perfectly.

7
00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:37.557
So I'll ask one more time.

8
00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:41.467
When is a door not a door?

9
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:43.023
When it's "ajar."

10
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.466
Like one of those.

11
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.466
The jar I'm looking for
has a special symbol on it,

12
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.122
a triskelion,
three spirals connected.

13
00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789
We don't know what
you're talking about.

14
00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:57.222
Maybe you should leave.

15
00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.254
Oh.

16
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:02.589
It's a very special jar,
actually.

17
00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.854
It was made from the wood
of a sacred tree

18
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.921
and used to capture
a dark Kitsune...

19
00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:12.153
A trickster spirit
called Nogitsune.

20
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.688
Well, all these jars
contain are teas and spices.

21
00:02:15.753 --> 00:02:17.653
So whatever it is you
came here looking for...

22
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.487
You know exactly what I came
here looking for, Mr. Dunbar.

23
00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.486
You all do.

24
00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:08.382
Hikari!

25
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:19.147
No!

26
00:03:22.582 --> 00:03:23.614
No!

27
00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:27.781
You don't know
what you're doing!

28
00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:31.781
I've been searching
for this for years.

29
00:03:31.847 --> 00:03:34.213
I know precisely what I'm doing.

30
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.546
You can't control it.

31
00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:37.513
I don't want to.

32
00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.045
Set me free.

33
00:03:51.112 --> 00:03:52.912
Not until you make me a promise.

34
00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:56.811
What fool would ask a promise
from a trickster spirit?

35
00:03:56.878 --> 00:03:59.378
Call it a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

36
00:03:59.478 --> 00:04:02.454
If you're as all powerful and
omniscient as they say.

37
00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:04.910
Then you already know
what I want.

38
00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.544
You want retribution

39
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.610
against him,

40
00:04:11.677 --> 00:04:14.943
his friends,

41
00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.076
and everyone he loves.

42
00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:22.276
Set me free

43
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:26.509
and we'll play a new game,

44
00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:28.452
a game of chaos,

45
00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.908
strife,

46
00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:34.208
and pain!

47
00:04:58.773 --> 00:04:59.839
You said it wouldn't bite.

48
00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.639
I said it wouldn't bite me.

49
00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:03.138
But that's also
because I wouldn't

50
00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:07.138
put my hand in front of
the mouth of a frightened dog.

51
00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:08.705
Thanks for the advice.

52
00:05:08.772 --> 00:05:10.304
You got any idea how we're going
to get it out of there?

53
00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:12.204
I have someone coming
who has a special talent

54
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.538
for these kinds of things.

55
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.371
He runs the animal shelter
next to my clinic.

56
00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:18.471
Trust me, he's highly qualified.

57
00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:19.937
We even have a nickname for him.

58
00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:21.471
Oh yeah? What?

59
00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:24.170
We call him "The Alpha."

60
00:05:41.502 --> 00:05:42.769
The girl climbed out,

61
00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:44.234
tried to pull it out,
lost her footing,

62
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:47.734
and ended up falling in too.

63
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.834
Is that all you got?

64
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:50.168
No protective gear? No gloves?

65
00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:51.534
I don't get bit.

66
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.067
Even if I did, I usually
heal pretty fast.

67
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:57.200
Well, even so...

68
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.767
No! He's gonna bite!

69
00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.100
Hey there.

70
00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:03.467
My name is Scott.

71
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.733
I'm going to help
get you guys out of here.

72
00:06:29.197 --> 00:06:30.698
Scott, hurry! Come on!

73
00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:31.697
Get out of there!

74
00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:43.663
All right, climb onto me.

75
00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:44.896
Climb onto me.

76
00:06:58.062 --> 00:06:59.962
Come on, Alicia.

77
00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:01.227
I got you.

78
00:07:19.493 --> 00:07:22.060
That was close.

79
00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:25.493
Hey, Alicia? You guys?

80
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.592
Let's go see the paramedics, OK?

81
00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.435
What do you guys call him again?

82
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:34.091
The Alpha.

83
00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:36.324
Right, like a dog.

84
00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:39.258
No, like a wolf.

85
00:08:48.952 --> 00:08:51.217
Good boy.

86
00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:53.284
OK. Come here, buddy.

87
00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:00.151
Do you know why
Cooper bit the lieutenant?

88
00:09:00.217 --> 00:09:01.451
Because he was scared?

89
00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:02.951
He was scared for you.

90
00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:06.983
It's one of the best parts
about dogs, they fight for us.

91
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.283
Remember, the same way that we
see them as part of our family,

92
00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:11.816
they see us
as part of their pack.

93
00:09:24.214 --> 00:09:25.615
There's still time.

94
00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:30.048
Oh, I know.

95
00:09:30.114 --> 00:09:31.848
Yeah, I'll have kids
one of these days,

96
00:09:31.914 --> 00:09:35.914
after I find someone,
or someone finds me, I guess.

97
00:09:35.981 --> 00:09:40.713
Yeah, I meant there's still
time to beat traffic.

98
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.513
But if you want to talk,
there's still time for that too.

99
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.879
I think I was just,
maybe feeling kind of, uh...

100
00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.447
Wistful.

101
00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:56.979
It means a kind of
longing or regret,

102
00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.446
a sort of melancholy
about the past

103
00:09:59.512 --> 00:10:01.479
and the choices we've made.

104
00:10:04.211 --> 00:10:06.377
Wistful.

105
00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:08.845
- Why don't you lock up?
I'll get my stuff.

106
00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:27.309
I didn't see him.

107
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:29.342
I took my eyes off the road
for, like, two seconds!

108
00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:30.543
Quiet!

109
00:11:17.605 --> 00:11:19.071
Oh! Jesus!

110
00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:24.138
Hey.

111
00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:27.638
Shit, dude.

112
00:11:27.704 --> 00:11:29.303
You know you could just
use the front door, right?

113
00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:33.637
I never use the front door.

114
00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:35.570
Especially when it's not safe.

115
00:11:35.637 --> 00:11:37.703
Who says it's not safe?

116
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.736
You're seeing her too.

117
00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:48.436
I mean, I've dreamt about her.

118
00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:50.035
You know, now and then
over the years

119
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:55.101
I've had images flicker in front
of my eyes like blurry photos.

120
00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:59.411
And then, two weeks ago,
something changed.

121
00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:02.535
Those random images

122
00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:05.700
flickering through
my head got clearer.

123
00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.600
I saw flashes of her crying out,

124
00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:10.410
silently screaming in pain,

125
00:12:10.434 --> 00:12:11.434
in agony.

126
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.866
She was suffering.

127
00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.199
Allison.

128
00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:20.433
But I started seeing her face
more and more.

129
00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:23.533
And then I started
hearing her voice.

130
00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:27.409
And I can hear somebody
whispering to me.

131
00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:28.410
Whispering what?

132
00:12:28.434 --> 00:12:31.432
One word, and only one.

133
00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:33.632
I hear it every time I go to
sleep and every time I wake up,

134
00:12:33.698 --> 00:12:36.231
and I only wake up
from nightmares.

135
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.231
What word?

136
00:12:40.264 --> 00:12:41.464
Bardo.

137
00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:49.896
Uh, I... I, uh...

138
00:12:49.963 --> 00:12:51.296
I was on the phone the other day
and I was writing down

139
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.630
a client's number.

140
00:12:52.696 --> 00:12:55.596
But instead of the number,
I wrote that.

141
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.429
Scott, do you know
what bardo is?

142
00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:03.962
A state between life and death.

143
00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:05.129
You and I,
we're both seeing her.

144
00:13:05.194 --> 00:13:07.194
We're both speaking
the same word.

145
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:08.429
It's not just a dream.

146
00:13:08.495 --> 00:13:10.529
Allison is caught between
life and death.

147
00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:12.628
It's not that simple.

148
00:13:12.694 --> 00:13:13.994
Bardo is a Tibetan word.

149
00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.528
It's a means of
interpreting death

150
00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:16.961
and the movements
of consciousness

151
00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:19.293
between physical states
of being.

152
00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:21.561
It's just a word.

153
00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:22.893
It's a concept.

154
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.560
Well, that fucking concept
is waking me up

155
00:13:24.627 --> 00:13:26.127
in the middle of the night
in a cold sweat,

156
00:13:26.193 --> 00:13:30.059
telling me my daughter
is still out there!

157
00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:31.593
She can't be.

158
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.592
I mean, she...
She died in my arms.

159
00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:37.192
I felt her slip away from me.

160
00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:38.526
I know we all die.

161
00:13:38.592 --> 00:13:41.759
I'm not pretending to know
what happens next.

162
00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:44.758
But if there was something
after this life, some next step,

163
00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:46.426
I don't think she made it.

164
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:50.058
And I think she's trying to
tell us she never crossed over.

165
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:53.990
It's been 15 years.

166
00:13:54.057 --> 00:13:57.425
Let's say we accept all this.

167
00:13:57.458 --> 00:13:59.557
What can we actually do to help?

168
00:13:59.624 --> 00:14:02.524
- There's a... a...
A ritual of some kind.

169
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.289
I know a few details.

170
00:14:04.424 --> 00:14:07.123
I got a feeling the real answers
are in Beacon Hills.

171
00:14:10.423 --> 00:14:11.556
OK.

172
00:14:11.623 --> 00:14:13.856
What else can you say
for certain?

173
00:14:13.923 --> 00:14:16.055
It has to be done by
the next full moon.

174
00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:18.988
And if it's not,
we don't get another chance.

175
00:14:20.488 --> 00:14:21.722
I'm not sure.

176
00:14:21.788 --> 00:14:25.121
And I'll admit,
I'm a little scared.

177
00:14:25.187 --> 00:14:27.588
We're talking about
dangerous rituals,

178
00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:29.654
thousands of years old.

179
00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:31.254
There are going to
be repercussions.

180
00:14:31.321 --> 00:14:34.154
So can somebody
just say one thing?

181
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.253
Are we doing this or not?

182
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.853
Well, the message
was for you, Scott.

183
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.320
It's yours to answer.

184
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:41.421
It's more than a message.

185
00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:50.085
This is the sword
that killed her.

186
00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:52.420
Her blood

187
00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:55.419
stained the blade.

188
00:14:55.485 --> 00:14:57.719
I haven't been to Beacon Hills
in a long time.

189
00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:03.151
None of us have.

190
00:15:03.218 --> 00:15:05.818
But if you drive out tomorrow,
I can meet you there

191
00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:08.684
by afternoon.

192
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.950
We're gonna need more help.

193
00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:12.418
And more answers.

194
00:15:15.183 --> 00:15:18.216
Yeah, I'm gonna need to find
some old friends.

195
00:15:20.617 --> 00:15:23.517
- Sound energy...
I'm speaking specifically

196
00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:26.149
of the sounds that fill
our acoustic environment.

197
00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:28.315
Our current ability to harness
those sounds,

198
00:15:28.416 --> 00:15:31.115
as not only
a renewable energy source,

199
00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:34.081
but as a green sustainable
electric energy.

200
00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:36.416
Lydia, I hate to
interrupt you, especially

201
00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:38.981
since you're going full throttle
with this tech shit

202
00:15:39.048 --> 00:15:40.448
that none of us really seem
to understand.

203
00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:42.681
Thanks for the input, Rick,
and for not interrupting.

204
00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:45.047
- Yeah. Lyd, listen...
- Continuing on,

205
00:15:45.114 --> 00:15:47.547
research into energy harvesting,

206
00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:48.914
up until now...

207
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.014
Lydia, I just have one tiny,
little question.

208
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.780
Lyd...
- Stop calling me Lyd.

209
00:15:52.847 --> 00:15:54.390
- Lydia!
- Rick.

210
00:15:54.414 --> 00:15:55.813
For someone who hates
to interrupt,

211
00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:58.113
you seem oddly compelled
to keep doing it.

212
00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:01.779
Look, all I want to know is,
who's Allison?

213
00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:20.911
Lyd.

214
00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:48.198
Um, hey, Sheriff?

215
00:18:48.263 --> 00:18:49.531
I really hate to bother you.

216
00:18:49.598 --> 00:18:51.431
I just got a phone call
from Deputy Parrish.

217
00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:55.398
He wants to talk to our...
consultant.

218
00:18:55.464 --> 00:18:57.697
Another incident
at the auto shop?

219
00:18:57.763 --> 00:18:59.830
His son definitely has

220
00:18:59.897 --> 00:19:01.930
an unhealthy fixation
on that Jeep.

221
00:19:03.129 --> 00:19:04.196
Do you want me to tell him?

222
00:19:04.262 --> 00:19:07.262
- Nah.
He better hear it from me.

223
00:19:14.496 --> 00:19:16.161
You were right.

224
00:19:16.228 --> 00:19:17.628
It wasn't gasoline.

225
00:19:17.695 --> 00:19:19.995
Whoever set this fire used
a chemical accelerant.

226
00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:21.795
Four fires in two weeks.

227
00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:23.761
That's a serial arsonist.

228
00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:25.495
Do I need to call in the FBI?

229
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:28.094
Well, maybe you should be
calling your son.

230
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.694
Trust me, right now Stiles
has his own fires

231
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.370
to put out.

232
00:19:31.394 --> 00:19:32.894
I think we can handle
one arsonist.

233
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.560
The only thing I'd say is,
this one seems to have a plan.

234
00:19:41.826 --> 00:19:43.959
You need to get that?

235
00:19:44.026 --> 00:19:46.559
- Yeah.
- No.

236
00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:48.626
It... it can... it can wait.

237
00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:49.825
Mm-hmm.

238
00:19:53.558 --> 00:19:56.291
- You want me to answer it?
- No.

239
00:19:56.392 --> 00:19:59.525
Why do I have a feeling
that that's about me?

240
00:19:59.592 --> 00:20:01.458
Or maybe my son?

241
00:20:03.191 --> 00:20:05.323
He still seems pretty intent
on leaving high school

242
00:20:05.391 --> 00:20:07.424
with a grand theft auto charge.

243
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.491
He took the Jeep again,
didn't he?

244
00:20:11.557 --> 00:20:14.256
Why the hell does he keep
taking the Jeep?

245
00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:15.790
Because he knows I hate it.

246
00:20:34.054 --> 00:20:36.054
What the...

247
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.020
I'm not paying for those.

248
00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:45.987
Oh, yes, you are.

249
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.387
What's up, guys?

250
00:21:49.682 --> 00:21:51.181
I... I can't...

251
00:21:51.247 --> 00:21:52.415
I can't take your pain.

252
00:21:52.482 --> 00:21:55.281
That's because it doesn't hurt.

253
00:22:14.845 --> 00:22:17.512
Hey, thanks for coming so fast.

254
00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:18.645
Yeah.

255
00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.445
Hey.

256
00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:34.578
Do you really think
all this is true?

257
00:22:34.644 --> 00:22:37.010
Allison being stuck,

258
00:22:37.077 --> 00:22:40.043
unable to cross over?

259
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.510
I don't know.

260
00:22:43.877 --> 00:22:47.676
But if being here and doing
this thing actually helps her,

261
00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:50.109
and no one else gets hurt,

262
00:22:50.176 --> 00:22:53.376
I'm up for trying.

263
00:22:53.442 --> 00:22:55.175
OK.

264
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:57.642
Then let's try.

265
00:23:03.741 --> 00:23:08.107
We need a handful of earth from
the ground where Allison died.

266
00:23:08.174 --> 00:23:10.074
- OK.
- OK.

267
00:24:03.802 --> 00:24:04.735
What's next?

268
00:24:19.468 --> 00:24:20.768
Anybody mind if
we close this thing?

269
00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:21.768
Yeah.

270
00:24:24.967 --> 00:24:27.501
Does your, uh,

271
00:24:27.568 --> 00:24:30.533
mom know that you're here?

272
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.900
Does she know that you're here?

273
00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:33.166
No.

274
00:24:33.232 --> 00:24:35.343
And I kind of want to
keep it that way.

275
00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:36.467
Yeah, me too.

276
00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:40.232
All right.

277
00:24:40.367 --> 00:24:41.367
Lydia, we've got the earth
where she died,

278
00:24:41.432 --> 00:24:42.599
the weapon that took her life.

279
00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:44.832
According to you,
that's steps one and two.

280
00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:46.342
What is next?

281
00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:51.898
I was, uh, hoping you could
help me figure that out.

282
00:24:51.965 --> 00:24:54.165
I mean, to be honest,
I'm a little out of practice

283
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:56.398
with all of this.

284
00:24:56.465 --> 00:24:58.830
You still scream like
a banshee, right?

285
00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:01.197
Not quite like I used to.

286
00:25:01.264 --> 00:25:02.398
It's just like a muscle.

287
00:25:02.465 --> 00:25:05.464
You stop using it,
and it atrophies.

288
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.597
Why did you stop
using your power?

289
00:25:07.664 --> 00:25:09.397
Stiles.

290
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:12.229
Obviously it has something
to do with Stiles.

291
00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:15.363
Why is Jackson here?

292
00:25:17.896 --> 00:25:20.128
What are you doing?

293
00:25:20.195 --> 00:25:22.995
Well, firstly,
Jackson prefers not

294
00:25:23.062 --> 00:25:25.695
to be talked about
like he's not in the room.

295
00:25:25.762 --> 00:25:30.161
Second, well, Lydia called,
begging me to help, as usual.

296
00:25:30.227 --> 00:25:32.338
And I said, OK,

297
00:25:32.362 --> 00:25:34.227
so long as she promised
never to tell Ethan,

298
00:25:34.362 --> 00:25:35.827
because I promised Ethan
that I would never

299
00:25:35.894 --> 00:25:38.194
come back to this nightmare
hellscape of a town.

300
00:25:38.261 --> 00:25:40.260
Thank you.

301
00:25:40.361 --> 00:25:42.494
Oh, I love these games.

302
00:25:44.993 --> 00:25:46.560
This isn't a game.

303
00:25:46.626 --> 00:25:50.660
I have claws that
drip paralytic venom,

304
00:25:50.726 --> 00:25:52.526
and a tail that'll
snap your neck.

305
00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:55.192
So take your hand
off of me, old man.

306
00:26:20.857 --> 00:26:21.990
Oh.

307
00:26:34.922 --> 00:26:36.356
It's a tree.

308
00:26:36.422 --> 00:26:37.988
It's not just a tree.

309
00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:39.988
It's the Sacred Grove.

310
00:26:40.055 --> 00:26:43.588
The ancients Druids
call it a nemeton.

311
00:26:43.655 --> 00:26:45.821
Well, it looks like a tree.

312
00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:15.085
All right.

313
00:27:15.152 --> 00:27:16.885
Can we just...

314
00:27:16.952 --> 00:27:18.418
Can we just stop
before either of us

315
00:27:18.485 --> 00:27:19.918
does anything
completely embarrassing?

316
00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:23.385
I think that qualifies
as pretty embarrassing.

317
00:27:23.452 --> 00:27:24.751
It was coming loose anyway.

318
00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:26.217
Are you gonna punish me or not?

319
00:27:26.352 --> 00:27:28.351
Cause otherwise,
I'll just go to my room.

320
00:27:28.384 --> 00:27:30.216
- Eli, I don't...
I don't want to punish you.

321
00:27:30.351 --> 00:27:32.484
I'd like to maybe understand
what you think you were doing.

322
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:34.551
I needed a ride to meet
my friends after the game.

323
00:27:34.617 --> 00:27:36.250
What is wrong with that?

324
00:27:36.351 --> 00:27:37.816
You're 15,
you don't have a license,

325
00:27:37.883 --> 00:27:39.150
and it's called
breaking the law.

326
00:27:39.216 --> 00:27:41.016
You never broke the law?

327
00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:42.416
OK. You know what?

328
00:27:42.483 --> 00:27:43.816
If this is about
the other thing,

329
00:27:43.883 --> 00:27:45.182
then let's talk about
the other thing.

330
00:27:45.249 --> 00:27:46.583
I don't want to talk to you
about anything.

331
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.915
I wouldn't push it
if it wasn't a thing.

332
00:27:47.982 --> 00:27:49.715
But we both know
it's not just anything,

333
00:27:49.782 --> 00:27:51.449
and now it's
definitely something.

334
00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:53.049
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

335
00:27:53.115 --> 00:27:54.349
Are you listening to yourself?

336
00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:55.549
You sound drunk.

337
00:27:55.615 --> 00:27:57.714
- I can't get drunk.
You know that.

338
00:27:57.781 --> 00:27:59.881
- It's not my problem.
- Eli, it's a thing!

339
00:27:59.948 --> 00:28:01.214
OK, to you, not me.

340
00:28:01.349 --> 00:28:02.248
I can teach you.

341
00:28:02.348 --> 00:28:03.481
What if I don't want to learn?

342
00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:04.548
Well, you're gonna
have to learn.

343
00:28:04.614 --> 00:28:06.047
It's who you are. You're a Hale.

344
00:28:06.113 --> 00:28:07.514
I'll change my name.

345
00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:09.080
That won't change the fact
that you're a werewolf!

346
00:28:09.147 --> 00:28:10.514
And what if I'm not?

347
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.880
Maybe that's why
I can't turn into one?

348
00:28:14.947 --> 00:28:17.347
You know, what if I'm
the first ever Hale

349
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.912
not to turn into a werewolf?

350
00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:24.246
To be honest,

351
00:28:24.346 --> 00:28:26.412
it would probably make
life a little easier.

352
00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:28.911
Yeah, for me?

353
00:28:28.978 --> 00:28:30.011
Or you?

354
00:28:45.378 --> 00:28:46.977
Definitely me.

355
00:29:21.641 --> 00:29:23.206
You're trespassing.

356
00:29:26.073 --> 00:29:27.073
You're naked.

357
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.206
You're not.

358
00:29:37.406 --> 00:29:39.705
Better?

359
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.771
Eli, come on out.

360
00:29:57.838 --> 00:30:01.003
I was thinking we could
practice before the game.

361
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.338
You know, basketball was
really always more my thing.

362
00:30:03.403 --> 00:30:05.970
But, uh, I think
I'm getting better.

363
00:30:06.037 --> 00:30:08.503
Maybe you can show me
some tricks?

364
00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:22.101
Or maybe not.

365
00:30:55.732 --> 00:30:57.565
You're giving me
that look again.

366
00:30:57.632 --> 00:30:59.565
- What look?
- The look.

367
00:30:59.632 --> 00:31:00.732
- What are you talking about?
There's no look.

368
00:31:00.798 --> 00:31:02.632
- There's a look.
- What look?

369
00:31:02.698 --> 00:31:05.764
The relationship look.

370
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:08.398
- Oh.
- Yeah, that look.

371
00:31:08.465 --> 00:31:10.431
Did I say anything?

372
00:31:10.497 --> 00:31:13.431
You said it with a look.

373
00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:15.364
And I'm not changing my mind.

374
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:17.163
And I'm not asking you to.

375
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.230
OK.

376
00:31:20.063 --> 00:31:21.063
But your look is.

377
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.663
All right.

378
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.330
But, since we're
talking about it...

379
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.829
Sorry.

380
00:31:36.662 --> 00:31:38.028
I got to go.

381
00:31:50.927 --> 00:31:52.428
What are you doing here?

382
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:53.593
Looking for answers.

383
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.827
And I'm wondering if you've made
any recent trips to Japan.

384
00:32:17.758 --> 00:32:20.190
- Oh, for the love of God.
Come on.

385
00:32:28.857 --> 00:32:30.757
Oh! I missed you!

386
00:32:30.824 --> 00:32:32.390
- I missed you too.
- No, you didn't.

387
00:32:32.457 --> 00:32:33.690
OK. I wanted to.

388
00:32:33.757 --> 00:32:35.324
Well, that I can believe.

389
00:32:36.756 --> 00:32:38.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:32:42.623 --> 00:32:44.155
It's good to see you.

391
00:32:44.222 --> 00:32:46.623
It's kind of awkward to see you.

392
00:32:46.688 --> 00:32:48.456
I know.

393
00:32:48.522 --> 00:32:49.988
OK!

394
00:32:50.055 --> 00:32:52.187
Let's go find a tree
in the woods.

395
00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:02.787
Come on.

396
00:33:02.854 --> 00:33:04.321
You said we need to find
this thing by nightfall.

397
00:33:10.953 --> 00:33:14.420
I haven't been to Japan
in years.

398
00:33:14.486 --> 00:33:15.686
Are you sure about that?

399
00:33:15.753 --> 00:33:17.219
Positive.

400
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.819
How long has it been since
you were in Beacon Hills?

401
00:33:19.885 --> 00:33:21.052
Because I seem to remember
you telling us that

402
00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.985
you were going to stay
in Los Angeles.

403
00:33:23.052 --> 00:33:25.752
I was, but I wanted to ask you
another question.

404
00:33:25.819 --> 00:33:30.385
And it, um, it might
sound a little strange.

405
00:33:30.452 --> 00:33:34.218
You walk into a room
that contains a match,

406
00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:38.351
a kerosene lamp,
a candle, and a fireplace.

407
00:33:38.418 --> 00:33:40.017
What would you light first?

408
00:33:40.083 --> 00:33:41.217
The match.

409
00:33:43.183 --> 00:33:45.717
You came all this way to
Beacon Hills to ask me that?

410
00:33:45.783 --> 00:33:48.450
I do have another question.

411
00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:50.982
What has to be broken
before it can be used?

412
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:53.682
An egg.

413
00:33:53.749 --> 00:33:56.317
I'm tall when I'm young,

414
00:33:56.382 --> 00:33:58.649
and I'm short when I'm old.

415
00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:02.316
What am I?
- A candle.

416
00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:04.582
Do you want to talk
about that bullet,

417
00:34:04.648 --> 00:34:06.848
or you want to keep
asking me children's riddles?

418
00:34:06.915 --> 00:34:08.715
What month of the year
has 28 days?

419
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:11.291
All of them.

420
00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:12.715
What has many keys...

421
00:34:12.781 --> 00:34:14.648
Stop.

422
00:34:14.714 --> 00:34:16.381
Stop talking.

423
00:34:16.448 --> 00:34:19.814
What has many keys
yet opens no locks?

424
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.146
A piano.

425
00:34:21.213 --> 00:34:23.079
What has many teeth
but cannot bite?

426
00:34:23.146 --> 00:34:24.780
A comb.

427
00:34:29.446 --> 00:34:31.713
What is always in front of you
but can never be seen?

428
00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:34.178
The future.

429
00:34:34.313 --> 00:34:36.713
The more of this there is,
the less you can see.

430
00:34:36.778 --> 00:34:39.778
What is it?

431
00:34:39.845 --> 00:34:42.312
Darkness, you motherfucker!

432
00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:07.643
It's me.

433
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.310
Um, hey, we're still looking.

434
00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:13.209
Just getting a little worried
about meeting up on time.

435
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.309
So just give me a call
or text, anything.

436
00:35:19.542 --> 00:35:21.774
Mm.

437
00:35:21.841 --> 00:35:23.475
OK.

438
00:35:28.808 --> 00:35:30.173
Ah!

439
00:35:30.308 --> 00:35:31.441
It's this way.

440
00:35:31.508 --> 00:35:32.641
It's this way.

441
00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:42.039
What is it?

442
00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.340
Someone's following us.

443
00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:49.406
They've been following us
pretty much the whole time.

444
00:35:49.472 --> 00:35:51.105
Who?

445
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:55.071
Here, come here!

446
00:35:55.138 --> 00:35:56.282
Wait, wait,
I wasn't doing anything!

447
00:35:56.306 --> 00:35:57.372
Sorry!

448
00:35:57.439 --> 00:35:58.671
Uh.

449
00:35:58.738 --> 00:36:00.671
It is you.

450
00:36:00.738 --> 00:36:03.004
Eli, Derek's son.

451
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.538
Wow, you've gotten really big.

452
00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:06.104
Yeah, It's probably
because I was only three

453
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.770
the last time you saw me.

454
00:36:07.837 --> 00:36:09.371
What are you doing out here?

455
00:36:09.437 --> 00:36:11.404
I was kind of wondering what
you guys were doing out here.

456
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.637
Hiking.

457
00:36:12.704 --> 00:36:13.870
Can't you tell?

458
00:36:13.937 --> 00:36:15.136
It's a really nice night
for hiking.

459
00:36:15.203 --> 00:36:16.537
I know what you're looking for.

460
00:36:16.604 --> 00:36:17.836
The tree, right?

461
00:36:17.903 --> 00:36:19.203
That huge stump's that's
like 20-feet wide?

462
00:36:19.304 --> 00:36:20.936
You know how to find it?

463
00:36:21.003 --> 00:36:22.503
Kind of.

464
00:36:22.569 --> 00:36:23.703
I sleepwalk.

465
00:36:23.769 --> 00:36:25.135
I don't know why.

466
00:36:25.202 --> 00:36:26.835
But I've just been doing it
for the last few months.

467
00:36:26.902 --> 00:36:28.702
I used to wake up
in the woods too.

468
00:36:28.768 --> 00:36:30.835
After you were bit
by Peter, right?

469
00:36:30.902 --> 00:36:32.568
Yeah, your dad tell you
a few stories?

470
00:36:32.635 --> 00:36:33.802
Yeah, all of 'em.

471
00:36:33.868 --> 00:36:35.702
What about the tree?

472
00:36:35.768 --> 00:36:36.967
It's not far from here.

473
00:36:37.034 --> 00:36:38.134
I knew we were going
the right way.

474
00:36:38.201 --> 00:36:39.302
No, you were going
the wrong way.

475
00:36:39.368 --> 00:36:41.134
It's that way.
- We were circling back.

476
00:36:41.201 --> 00:36:42.734
- Hm.
- Thank you.

477
00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:43.801
Well, I can help you find it.

478
00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:45.867
- Got it.
- Hey, come on.

479
00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:54.600
What are you doing?

480
00:37:00.832 --> 00:37:03.466
So aren't you the screamer?

481
00:37:03.532 --> 00:37:04.799
Banshee.

482
00:37:04.865 --> 00:37:06.332
Yeah, but banshees scream,
right?

483
00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:09.765
Well, they wail if you want
to get technical, but yes.

484
00:37:09.832 --> 00:37:11.164
So how loud can you scream?

485
00:37:11.299 --> 00:37:12.998
Loud enough to create a burst
of acoustic energy

486
00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.098
that could crush your skull.

487
00:37:15.164 --> 00:37:17.498
Good to know.

488
00:37:17.564 --> 00:37:19.898
There it is.

489
00:37:19.964 --> 00:37:22.331
OK. OK.

490
00:37:23.997 --> 00:37:25.331
So what should we do
about Argent?

491
00:37:25.398 --> 00:37:28.763
Uh, I mean, I'm never
gonna get a signal now.

492
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.063
Even if he's texting me,
I wouldn't know.

493
00:37:30.129 --> 00:37:31.663
Well, we're going to
have to do this now.

494
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:32.896
We can't wait for him.

495
00:37:32.962 --> 00:37:34.196
It's his daughter.

496
00:37:34.297 --> 00:37:35.996
You said it has to be tonight.

497
00:37:36.062 --> 00:37:37.996
He would want us to do this
without him.

498
00:37:40.729 --> 00:37:42.362
Don't you have something to do?

499
00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:43.496
Yeah.

500
00:37:43.562 --> 00:37:44.995
Yeah, I have a lacrosse game
to play.

501
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:46.462
Well, more like a lacrosse
game to show up to

502
00:37:46.529 --> 00:37:49.296
since I, like,
I never get to play.

503
00:37:51.928 --> 00:37:53.428
Oh! You want me to leave?

504
00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:55.595
OK. Uh, I got it.

505
00:37:55.661 --> 00:37:57.528
OK, well, I'll tell my dad
that I saw you guys?

506
00:37:57.595 --> 00:37:59.594
No, don't.

507
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.760
Don't tell him anything.

508
00:38:00.827 --> 00:38:04.193
This is kind of...
- Personal.

509
00:38:04.294 --> 00:38:05.794
All right. Don't worry.

510
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.926
I won't say anything.

511
00:38:18.792 --> 00:38:19.825
All right.

512
00:38:19.892 --> 00:38:21.492
Now what?

513
00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:25.658
OK.

514
00:38:29.924 --> 00:38:32.791
Why are you looking at me?

515
00:38:32.857 --> 00:38:34.424
I didn't write the instructions.

516
00:38:34.491 --> 00:38:35.824
Yeah, you did.

517
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:37.324
You literally wrote
the instructions.

518
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:39.123
Okay, you know what I mean.

519
00:38:47.656 --> 00:38:48.923
Do you feel that?

520
00:38:48.989 --> 00:38:50.656
Yeah.

521
00:39:10.554 --> 00:39:12.987
What the hell?

522
00:39:13.053 --> 00:39:14.787
Uh...

523
00:39:41.951 --> 00:39:43.018
OK.

524
00:39:43.085 --> 00:39:44.418
That was fun.

525
00:39:44.485 --> 00:39:46.017
Um, you guys want to go
get something to eat now?

526
00:39:56.717 --> 00:39:59.016
I know.

527
00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:19.047
Hey, guys.

528
00:40:44.945 --> 00:40:46.179
It's Allison.

529
00:40:54.044 --> 00:40:56.078
She's alive.

530
00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:07.810
This can't be real.

531
00:41:07.877 --> 00:41:08.943
It can't be her.

532
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:10.177
She was cremated.

533
00:41:10.277 --> 00:41:11.510
She looks pretty
un-cremated to me.

534
00:41:11.577 --> 00:41:12.943
She's not just un-cremated.

535
00:41:13.009 --> 00:41:15.253
She's literally been
reconstituted out of thin air.

536
00:41:15.277 --> 00:41:18.142
So that wasn't in
the instructions?

537
00:41:20.742 --> 00:41:22.442
I got a question.

538
00:41:22.509 --> 00:41:24.542
What do we do when she wakes up?

539
00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:26.276
If she wakes up.

540
00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:33.575
We need some help.

541
00:41:35.074 --> 00:41:36.308
Mom, we got a problem.

542
00:41:40.174 --> 00:41:43.140
She looks just like Allison.

543
00:41:43.274 --> 00:41:46.973
Why, Scott, does she look
exactly like Allison?

544
00:41:47.039 --> 00:41:48.607
You really want to know?

545
00:41:48.674 --> 00:41:50.906
Just get her inside.

546
00:41:50.973 --> 00:41:52.639
OK.

547
00:42:37.635 --> 00:42:41.902
Chaos!

548
00:42:41.969 --> 00:42:46.001
Strife!

549
00:42:46.068 --> 00:42:48.868
Pain!

550
00:42:54.634 --> 00:42:55.733
Listen up!

551
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.167
Tonight's game
is not just a game.

552
00:42:59.268 --> 00:43:01.533
This is a preamble
to what comes tomorrow,

553
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.633
an overture to a symphony
of victory!

554
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.333
This tournament
is everything I've dreamed of

555
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.267
my entire career
as a lacrosse coach.

556
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.899
And that trophy is
going right here, boys.

557
00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:16.898
And I know none of you
will ruin it for me

558
00:43:16.965 --> 00:43:19.242
by losing this game tonight!

559
00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:20.332
Am I right?

560
00:43:20.399 --> 00:43:22.798
All: Yes, Coach!

561
00:43:22.865 --> 00:43:23.931
Oh.

562
00:43:23.998 --> 00:43:24.998
It's just you.

563
00:43:25.065 --> 00:43:26.831
Just me.

564
00:43:26.898 --> 00:43:28.764
But I'm here, with him.

565
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.330
We can talk about it later.

566
00:43:34.397 --> 00:43:35.564
I came to watch you play.

567
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.864
Well, prepare for
disappointment,

568
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.896
'cause if you didn't notice,
I never play.

569
00:43:40.963 --> 00:43:43.929
I noticed, and I'm going to
talk to your coach about it.

570
00:43:43.996 --> 00:43:45.264
Oh, God, no! No, no!

571
00:43:45.296 --> 00:43:48.429
- Hey, Coach, can I have a word?
- Don't do that.

572
00:43:48.496 --> 00:43:51.995
Eli,
you probably got the feeling

573
00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:54.396
that I'm not actually here
to watch your game.

574
00:43:54.462 --> 00:43:56.628
Yeah?
- Kinda.

575
00:43:56.695 --> 00:44:00.362
And that maybe I'm here to
give my good friend, your dad,

576
00:44:00.428 --> 00:44:02.495
just a little support as
he deals with

577
00:44:02.562 --> 00:44:05.262
his somewhat delinquent son.

578
00:44:05.295 --> 00:44:06.262
Maybe.

579
00:44:06.328 --> 00:44:07.927
But I'm not.

580
00:44:07.994 --> 00:44:09.094
I'm here to warn you.

581
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.361
You steal that Jeep again,

582
00:44:10.427 --> 00:44:12.294
I'm going to haul your ass
into a jail cell,

583
00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:13.793
have you tried as an adult,

584
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.860
and watch you get sent
to the state penitentiary

585
00:44:15.926 --> 00:44:18.326
for a minimum of 90 days.

586
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.326
Did he tell you to scare me?

587
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.626
Maybe.

588
00:44:24.693 --> 00:44:26.559
Good luck with the game, Eli.

589
00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:27.925
Yeah.

590
00:44:34.792 --> 00:44:36.359
What do you think about my son
getting a little playing time

591
00:44:36.425 --> 00:44:38.425
tonight?
- I think that's a great idea.

592
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:39.624
You don't know who my son is,
do you?

593
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:41.158
I don't know who you are.

594
00:44:41.258 --> 00:44:44.890
But you look pretty athletic,

595
00:44:44.957 --> 00:44:47.723
so I'm guessing your son is too.

596
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.823
That's my son.

597
00:44:52.257 --> 00:44:53.423
I was wrong.

598
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.122
Just give him five minutes
in the game.

599
00:44:55.257 --> 00:44:56.257
Let him prove himself.

600
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:57.657
Three minutes if we're winning.

601
00:44:57.723 --> 00:44:59.290
- Five minutes.
- OK.

602
00:44:59.357 --> 00:45:00.622
You know what?
You drive a tough bargain.

603
00:45:00.689 --> 00:45:03.356
Three it is!
- Coach.

604
00:45:03.422 --> 00:45:05.456
Four minutes!

605
00:45:05.522 --> 00:45:07.988
Not a second longer.

606
00:45:12.088 --> 00:45:14.588
What about four and 1/2?

607
00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:18.288
I checked her vitals.

608
00:45:18.355 --> 00:45:21.154
Everything's normal,
at least normal for a woman

609
00:45:21.255 --> 00:45:24.255
who's been dead for 15 years.

610
00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.554
Maybe we should cut her open

611
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.454
and then see
if she's normal inside.

612
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.254
Not exactly how medical
treatment works.

613
00:45:29.287 --> 00:45:30.554
But thanks for the suggestion.

614
00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.853
How do we know she's OK?

615
00:45:31.919 --> 00:45:35.553
I mean, not just physically
but mentally?

616
00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:37.419
How do we know this is Allison?

617
00:45:37.486 --> 00:45:39.229
Hm? Really Allison?

618
00:45:39.253 --> 00:45:41.152
We don't.

619
00:45:41.253 --> 00:45:43.486
This wasn't exactly part
of the plan.

620
00:45:43.553 --> 00:45:47.585
Maybe our first step is
simply talking with her.

621
00:45:47.652 --> 00:45:50.285
Since she doesn't appear
to be injured,

622
00:45:50.352 --> 00:45:53.518
we're probably OK
to try waking her up.

623
00:45:53.585 --> 00:45:56.484
- Mom?
- Yeah.

624
00:45:56.551 --> 00:45:58.517
I think she's awake.

625
00:46:19.982 --> 00:46:22.415
Our sons are trained
to be soldiers,

626
00:46:22.482 --> 00:46:26.482
daughters to be leaders.

627
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:29.148
Shapeshifter, lycan,

628
00:46:29.249 --> 00:46:32.748
werewolf,

629
00:46:32.814 --> 00:46:35.913
to me it's just
another dumb animal.

630
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.246
Allison.

631
00:46:57.279 --> 00:46:59.945
Allison.

632
00:47:00.011 --> 00:47:02.011
Allison?

633
00:47:02.078 --> 00:47:03.711
Where the hell does
she think she's going?

634
00:47:03.778 --> 00:47:05.278
She's probably
slightly confused.

635
00:47:05.345 --> 00:47:06.578
Supposed to be slightly dead.

636
00:47:06.645 --> 00:47:08.977
- Split up.
If you find her, yell.

637
00:47:09.844 --> 00:47:11.545
OK.

638
00:47:18.044 --> 00:47:19.143
Got her!

639
00:47:21.076 --> 00:47:22.644
Ah.

640
00:47:22.709 --> 00:47:24.244
Hey, Allison!

641
00:47:24.277 --> 00:47:25.576
You OK?

642
00:47:25.643 --> 00:47:26.976
Not me, man.

643
00:47:44.242 --> 00:47:45.674
Shit.

644
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:48.707
Hey, Allison, wait!

645
00:47:54.241 --> 00:47:55.840
Whoa!

646
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.216
Who are you?

647
00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.505
It's me. It's Scott.

648
00:48:13.572 --> 00:48:15.505
Scott who?

649
00:48:15.572 --> 00:48:18.215
McCall.

650
00:48:18.239 --> 00:48:19.904
Where's the alpha?

651
00:48:19.971 --> 00:48:20.738
You mean?

652
00:48:20.804 --> 00:48:23.138
Where's Derek Hale?

653
00:48:54.601 --> 00:48:56.468
Wait!

654
00:48:58.401 --> 00:49:02.235
Hey. Allison, she's alive.

655
00:49:02.301 --> 00:49:03.535
She's back.

656
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.067
She's not the only one.

657
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.033
Levchenko,
did you call the power company?

658
00:49:15.099 --> 00:49:16.334
I just did.

659
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.899
They said everything
is fine on their end.

660
00:49:17.966 --> 00:49:18.866
- Huh.
- Might be an

661
00:49:18.933 --> 00:49:20.433
electrical issue here.

662
00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:21.998
Sheriff, we got another problem

663
00:49:22.065 --> 00:49:23.798
that you might want to handle
first.

664
00:49:23.865 --> 00:49:30.432
If it's another fire,
I don't want to hear about it.

665
00:49:30.498 --> 00:49:32.465
Of course I want
to hear about it!

666
00:49:32.532 --> 00:49:35.131
Get the hell in here,
both of you!

667
00:49:35.232 --> 00:49:37.631
20 minutes ago, two hikers
were headed down the trails

668
00:49:37.697 --> 00:49:39.431
and they spotted smoke.

669
00:49:39.497 --> 00:49:40.864
We've got another witness
who said

670
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:42.264
they passed by someone
wearing a heavy black coat,

671
00:49:42.331 --> 00:49:44.564
but couldn't see his face
because of a hood.

672
00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:45.631
OK.

673
00:49:45.697 --> 00:49:46.796
Levchenko, you're with me.

674
00:49:46.863 --> 00:49:49.030
Hewitt, you're with Parrish.

675
00:49:49.096 --> 00:49:51.763
Let's go.

676
00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.696
Is that a new uniform?

677
00:51:01.923 --> 00:51:04.823
How'd you get in here?

678
00:51:04.889 --> 00:51:09.623
The door was ajar.

679
00:51:09.689 --> 00:51:10.923
Who are you?

680
00:51:10.989 --> 00:51:14.922
Someone who knows you

681
00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:17.622
better than you know yourself.

682
00:51:17.688 --> 00:51:19.355
Hands up where I can see 'em!

683
00:51:33.854 --> 00:51:36.721
You are kitsune,

684
00:51:36.786 --> 00:51:39.086
but you don't know it.

685
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:45.720
Your brother, Ekaida,
he knew it,

686
00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:48.420
but he never told you.

687
00:51:48.486 --> 00:51:51.353
How do you know
about my brother?

688
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:56.452
The spirit in you, it's old.

689
00:51:56.519 --> 00:52:00.684
It's drawn to Beacon Hills.

690
00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:03.252
Don't come any closer!

691
00:52:03.319 --> 00:52:07.018
The power,

692
00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:09.950
it's like an armor
protecting you.

693
00:52:10.017 --> 00:52:13.650
But it cannot protect you now!

694
00:52:18.483 --> 00:52:19.683
Ah!

695
00:52:22.517 --> 00:52:24.116
Ah. Oh!

696
00:52:24.217 --> 00:52:26.082
Oh!

697
00:52:26.217 --> 00:52:29.048
There it is.

698
00:52:29.115 --> 00:52:32.282
I don't want your life,
little fox.

699
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.615
Oh. Ah.

700
00:52:34.681 --> 00:52:37.881
But I do want your tail.

701
00:52:37.948 --> 00:52:40.515
You have nine tails

702
00:52:40.581 --> 00:52:42.814
that can summon nine Oni.

703
00:52:44.315 --> 00:52:46.248
Now

704
00:52:46.315 --> 00:52:50.380
give them to me!

705
00:52:50.447 --> 00:52:52.247
- Scott.
- Yeah.

706
00:52:52.314 --> 00:52:53.714
We don't know where she's
going or what she's doing.

707
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.214
Or how the hell she's alive.

708
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.046
Well, can we answer that
question after we find her?

709
00:52:57.113 --> 00:52:58.713
That woman may look
like Allison,

710
00:52:58.779 --> 00:53:00.413
but it doesn't mean
that she is Allison.

711
00:53:00.479 --> 00:53:01.879
She didn't recognize me.

712
00:53:01.946 --> 00:53:04.279
Me either.

713
00:53:04.346 --> 00:53:05.313
But she saw me heal.

714
00:53:05.379 --> 00:53:06.845
She knows what I am.

715
00:53:06.912 --> 00:53:09.246
So she doesn't remember us but
she knows about werewolves.

716
00:53:09.313 --> 00:53:10.945
It's frighteningly convenient
for a werewolf hunter

717
00:53:11.012 --> 00:53:14.111
who just got brought back
to life.

718
00:53:14.212 --> 00:53:16.412
She also knew how to kick ass,

719
00:53:16.478 --> 00:53:17.744
specifically my ass.

720
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:19.011
Hold on.

721
00:53:19.077 --> 00:53:20.644
When I told her
my last name was McCall,

722
00:53:20.711 --> 00:53:22.444
she looked at me like she...

723
00:53:22.511 --> 00:53:23.777
was expecting something else.

724
00:53:23.844 --> 00:53:25.577
Hale.

725
00:53:25.644 --> 00:53:27.377
But if the only thing
that she remembers right now

726
00:53:27.444 --> 00:53:29.743
is that she hunts
and kills werewolves...

727
00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.277
Then we need to find Derek.

728
00:53:31.344 --> 00:53:32.476
I'm coming with you.

729
00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:33.976
OK.

730
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:58.374
Allison.

731
00:54:13.373 --> 00:54:14.407
Who are you?

732
00:54:14.473 --> 00:54:16.972
A friend,

733
00:54:17.039 --> 00:54:21.206
despite appearances.

734
00:54:22.805 --> 00:54:27.771
A friend with a fondness for...

735
00:54:27.838 --> 00:54:30.671
riddles.

736
00:54:30.738 --> 00:54:32.705
I don't remember liking riddles.

737
00:54:32.771 --> 00:54:36.937
Oh, you'll like this one.

738
00:54:37.004 --> 00:54:41.437
What's another word
for the metal silver,

739
00:54:41.504 --> 00:54:46.036
and also the name
of a legendary family

740
00:54:46.103 --> 00:54:50.703
who hunts werewolves?

741
00:54:50.769 --> 00:54:52.269
Argent.

742
00:54:52.336 --> 00:54:58.203
Allison Argent.

743
00:54:58.269 --> 00:55:01.203
Time to hunt.

744
00:55:01.269 --> 00:55:05.835
Time to kill Scott McCall,

745
00:55:05.901 --> 00:55:09.834
the werewolf
who destroyed your family.

746
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:11.368
I don't remember that name.

747
00:55:11.434 --> 00:55:14.267
Oh, you will.

748
00:55:14.334 --> 00:55:16.100
We will help you.

749
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:17.900
I don't fucking trust you.

750
00:55:17.966 --> 00:55:19.900
You would trust your mother,
wouldn't you?

751
00:55:24.266 --> 00:55:27.366
You're not my mother.

752
00:55:27.433 --> 00:55:29.099
But aren't I precisely the voice

753
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.665
you need to hear right now?

754
00:55:30.732 --> 00:55:33.499
No, my mother's dead.

755
00:55:33.565 --> 00:55:36.732
No. No.

756
00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:39.031
That's why I'm here.

757
00:55:39.098 --> 00:55:42.064
Our side has suffered
so many losses.

758
00:55:42.199 --> 00:55:48.964
Allison, you have to remember
Scott McCall, Derek Hale.

759
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.498
Those men,
those monsters have murdered

760
00:55:51.564 --> 00:55:53.030
so many innocent people.

761
00:55:53.097 --> 00:55:54.830
They have to be stopped.

762
00:55:57.198 --> 00:55:59.963
What do you want me to do?

763
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:03.630
The betas make the alpha
stronger.

764
00:56:03.696 --> 00:56:05.696
So I take out
the weakest members first?

765
00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:08.629
Scott McCall has too many
allies right now.

766
00:56:08.696 --> 00:56:10.096
So how do I get to him?

767
00:56:10.196 --> 00:56:12.961
The Oni will clear a path.

768
00:56:13.028 --> 00:56:16.296
They will clear the board
of the other pieces,

769
00:56:16.362 --> 00:56:21.228
leaving you to concentrate
on a winning move.

770
00:56:21.295 --> 00:56:23.994
What's the winning move?

771
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.727
In the game of Go,

772
00:56:27.794 --> 00:56:29.994
we call it the divine move.

773
00:56:39.194 --> 00:56:40.294
None of my texts
are going through.

774
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.793
I can't reach...

775
00:56:42.859 --> 00:56:44.992
anyone.

776
00:56:45.058 --> 00:56:47.459
Do you think that's connected?

777
00:56:55.892 --> 00:56:57.392
Oh!

778
00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:03.292
Someone was killed here.

779
00:57:03.357 --> 00:57:04.924
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
a lot of people

780
00:57:04.991 --> 00:57:06.090
have been killed here, Lydia.

781
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:07.657
Recently.

782
00:57:09.756 --> 00:57:12.023
Are we gonna be killed here?

783
00:57:23.423 --> 00:57:27.489
Please tell me that
Allison didn't do that.

784
00:57:27.555 --> 00:57:29.789
Dad, put me down!

785
00:57:29.855 --> 00:57:30.888
Please put me down.

786
00:57:30.954 --> 00:57:32.355
You said you couldn't walk.

787
00:57:32.422 --> 00:57:33.588
I can hop.

788
00:57:41.754 --> 00:57:42.953
Ow.

789
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.188
You almost had that shot.

790
00:57:44.221 --> 00:57:45.653
No, I didn't.

791
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.221
- Yes, you did. I saw it.
You were right at the goal.

792
00:57:48.287 --> 00:57:50.053
You're better than
you think you are.

793
00:57:50.187 --> 00:57:51.587
I was in for less than a minute.

794
00:57:51.653 --> 00:57:53.819
I got the ball for a second
and I got knocked on my ass

795
00:57:53.886 --> 00:57:55.919
and I twisted my ankle.

796
00:57:55.986 --> 00:57:57.886
It wasn't anything.
- Eli.

797
00:57:57.952 --> 00:57:58.986
It was nothing.

798
00:57:59.052 --> 00:58:00.386
It was something.

799
00:58:02.686 --> 00:58:06.186
I was watching Coach
and he saw it too.

800
00:58:06.252 --> 00:58:07.618
You're good.

801
00:58:07.685 --> 00:58:10.018
You're really good.

802
00:58:10.085 --> 00:58:12.718
And... if you can heal,

803
00:58:12.785 --> 00:58:14.385
you can play tomorrow night,

804
00:58:14.451 --> 00:58:17.351
and you can help them win.

805
00:58:17.418 --> 00:58:20.650
The first step to transforming
is healing,

806
00:58:20.717 --> 00:58:22.717
but you've got to be
willing to learn.

807
00:58:24.717 --> 00:58:26.350
Ah.

808
00:58:31.516 --> 00:58:32.749
Get down!

809
00:58:32.816 --> 00:58:34.716
Run! Run!

810
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:54.081
Allison?

811
00:59:52.942 --> 00:59:54.742
Ah!

812
01:00:09.175 --> 01:00:10.974
Liam?

813
01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.707
Oh, shit.

814
01:00:15.039 --> 01:00:17.440
Scott, get to Eli.

815
01:00:17.507 --> 01:00:18.873
Derek, he's not here.

816
01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:20.806
He was.

817
01:00:20.873 --> 01:00:22.140
He knows what to do.

818
01:00:22.207 --> 01:00:24.973
We... we have a plan.

819
01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.873
He has the...

820
01:00:26.939 --> 01:00:28.439
He has the car.

821
01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:30.072
Don't... don't try to talk.

822
01:00:30.139 --> 01:00:34.273
Eli, he'll go to the shop.

823
01:00:34.338 --> 01:00:36.738
He knows what to do.
He knows what to do.

824
01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:39.971
Don't talk.

825
01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:42.037
Hey, hey!

826
01:00:42.104 --> 01:00:43.238
- Scott.
- What?

827
01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:45.371
It's not just Allison.

828
01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:48.437
- It's the Oni. It's Nogitsune.
- They're coming.

829
01:00:55.003 --> 01:00:57.770
Scott, what do we do?

830
01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:07.735
Liam, get to Stilinski,
find Lydia,

831
01:01:07.802 --> 01:01:09.402
and tell them
we need their help.

832
01:01:09.469 --> 01:01:12.001
Tell them we need everyone.

833
01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.335
Malia, let's get him
out of here.

834
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.168
It looks like the radius

835
01:01:25.201 --> 01:01:27.168
is about the same
as the previous fires.

836
01:01:27.234 --> 01:01:28.301
Take the others
and see if you can find

837
01:01:28.368 --> 01:01:31.200
any kind of incendiary device.

838
01:01:31.267 --> 01:01:35.200
Parrish.

839
01:01:35.267 --> 01:01:37.799
What's your take on this?

840
01:01:37.866 --> 01:01:39.832
Are you asking me
as a deputy or?

841
01:01:39.899 --> 01:01:42.332
As someone who's known to
set himself on fire

842
01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.366
because he's a demon called
a hellhound?

843
01:01:44.432 --> 01:01:46.166
Yeah, but I'm a nice demon.

844
01:01:46.199 --> 01:01:48.665
Given.

845
01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:50.965
Who set these fires?

846
01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:53.031
- Not an arsonist.
- Yeah.

847
01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:56.331
A serial arsonist would want
to watch the fire burn,

848
01:01:56.398 --> 01:01:59.165
not have it snuffed out
minutes after ignition.

849
01:01:59.198 --> 01:02:02.331
And plus they typically have
an emotional cooling off period,

850
01:02:02.397 --> 01:02:03.364
and...
- These are being set

851
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:04.764
one after another.

852
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:06.530
And all that says one thing,
that these fires...

853
01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:09.464
Are not about fire.

854
01:02:10.696 --> 01:02:12.297
Go see what you can dig up.

855
01:02:12.364 --> 01:02:14.696
I'm gonna call our consultant.

856
01:02:25.495 --> 01:02:27.562
I know that sound.

857
01:02:36.262 --> 01:02:37.827
Parrish!

858
01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.227
Hewitt!

859
01:02:56.393 --> 01:02:59.325
Oh, God damn it.

860
01:02:59.392 --> 01:03:01.925
I knew I should've retired.

861
01:03:09.791 --> 01:03:11.724
Jeez!

862
01:03:21.023 --> 01:03:22.323
Eli! Eli.

863
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.157
We're gonna find him.

864
01:03:24.223 --> 01:03:25.290
But we have to help you first.

865
01:03:25.357 --> 01:03:27.257
No. No, Eli.

866
01:03:27.323 --> 01:03:30.489
His ankle, he twisted it.
He can't run.

867
01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:31.789
But he can heal.

868
01:03:31.856 --> 01:03:33.556
- No, he won't.
- Eli can't heal,

869
01:03:33.622 --> 01:03:35.789
not like a werewolf, not yet.

870
01:03:35.856 --> 01:03:37.289
What's wrong with him?

871
01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:39.422
You know how some people
pass out when they see a needle?

872
01:03:39.489 --> 01:03:40.855
Eli passes out when
he sees his own fangs.

873
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:42.156
He passes out?

874
01:03:42.222 --> 01:03:43.755
- The fangs come out.
- He's on the floor.

875
01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:46.020
Claws too.

876
01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:49.188
Scott, you have to find him.

877
01:03:49.255 --> 01:03:51.987
You have to find him before
she does.

878
01:04:20.385 --> 01:04:21.618
Sheriff!

879
01:04:25.784 --> 01:04:27.451
Sheriff!

880
01:04:29.284 --> 01:04:32.184
Where are you?

881
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:33.916
Mason?

882
01:04:33.983 --> 01:04:36.050
Mason, help.

883
01:04:37.883 --> 01:04:38.750
Help.

884
01:04:38.816 --> 01:04:40.683
Ah!

885
01:04:57.315 --> 01:04:58.681
Sheriff.

886
01:05:00.249 --> 01:05:01.548
No!

887
01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:09.613
Aw, shit.

888
01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:35.978
Go!

889
01:05:39.445 --> 01:05:41.378
All right. Come on.

890
01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:45.377
Easy.

891
01:05:45.444 --> 01:05:47.010
Here.

892
01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:49.210
Easy. Easy.

893
01:05:49.277 --> 01:05:50.410
You have to find Eli.

894
01:05:50.477 --> 01:05:51.577
Eli.

895
01:05:51.644 --> 01:05:53.144
You have to find Eli.

896
01:05:55.643 --> 01:05:59.209
Derek, you're gonna need to
let Scott and the others

897
01:05:59.276 --> 01:06:00.309
take care of it, OK?

898
01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:01.942
Anyone that loses
this much blood,

899
01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:03.276
human or werewolf,

900
01:06:03.343 --> 01:06:05.409
you're not gonna be any good
to anyone else.

901
01:06:05.475 --> 01:06:06.742
We need a lighter.

902
01:06:06.808 --> 01:06:08.708
The healing process
works faster with fire.

903
01:06:11.907 --> 01:06:15.841
I've been known to light
a spark or two in my time.

904
01:06:29.141 --> 01:06:31.440
Peter, no.

905
01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:52.871
Do I need to remind you people

906
01:06:52.938 --> 01:06:56.037
that he slashed my throat once
and it killed me?

907
01:06:56.138 --> 01:06:58.471
When it comes to you,
most of us try to forget.

908
01:06:58.538 --> 01:07:01.537
That is no way to speak
to your father.

909
01:07:01.603 --> 01:07:03.204
Look, we're running out of time.

910
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:04.603
We've got to catch up to Eli.

911
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.737
You mean before Allison does.

912
01:07:08.503 --> 01:07:09.969
Allison Argent,
back from the dead,

913
01:07:10.036 --> 01:07:11.470
running around,
shooting up werewolves

914
01:07:11.536 --> 01:07:12.802
like a good little hunter?

915
01:07:12.869 --> 01:07:14.869
You must be so proud.

916
01:07:16.436 --> 01:07:19.236
Can we just lower the level
of the testosterone

917
01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.801
in the room, fellas? Huh?

918
01:07:21.868 --> 01:07:22.935
Derek said that they had a plan

919
01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:24.136
for when something like this
happens.

920
01:07:24.202 --> 01:07:25.768
The auto shop.

921
01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:27.768
That's where they'll go.

922
01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:28.901
Emergency rendezvous point.

923
01:07:28.967 --> 01:07:30.135
How far behind was Allison?

924
01:07:30.168 --> 01:07:31.800
- Not far enough.
- I'm coming with you.

925
01:07:31.867 --> 01:07:34.934
No. You need to find Lydia.

926
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.734
Liam and Hikari are already
looking for Stilinski,

927
01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.334
but honestly, if there's anyone
who could figure

928
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.999
this thing out, it's Lydia.

929
01:07:40.134 --> 01:07:41.899
Find Lydia. I'll get Eli.

930
01:07:41.966 --> 01:07:43.134
- Wait.
- I gotta go.

931
01:07:43.167 --> 01:07:44.499
Wait!

932
01:07:44.566 --> 01:07:46.633
Scott, wait, wait.
- What, Mom? What?

933
01:07:48.933 --> 01:07:50.599
If there's some small chance
that it's her,

934
01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.366
that it's really Allison...

935
01:07:53.433 --> 01:07:55.565
It can't be, right?

936
01:07:55.632 --> 01:07:57.166
It's impossible.

937
01:07:57.233 --> 01:07:58.565
Listen to me.

938
01:07:58.632 --> 01:08:00.898
If I've learned anything
living in Beacon Hills,

939
01:08:00.965 --> 01:08:02.897
it's that every time someone
says something's impossible,

940
01:08:02.964 --> 01:08:05.697
somehow the impossible
seems to happen.

941
01:08:05.764 --> 01:08:06.831
If you think it's really her,

942
01:08:06.897 --> 01:08:09.198
you have to find her
and stop her

943
01:08:09.265 --> 01:08:12.664
and help her remember
who she was.

944
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:14.963
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

945
01:08:17.596 --> 01:08:19.930
Go get her.

946
01:08:48.128 --> 01:08:49.561
Come on.

947
01:09:58.721 --> 01:10:00.287
What do you smell?

948
01:10:05.087 --> 01:10:06.720
Fear.

949
01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:08.620
That would be me.

950
01:10:11.686 --> 01:10:13.220
You're gonna want to see this.

951
01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:20.052
He was a kitsune,

952
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.552
probably didn't even know it.

953
01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:23.885
If the Nogitsune murdered him,

954
01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:26.051
then he did it
to steal his tails.

955
01:10:26.119 --> 01:10:28.352
The tails only get him
one thing:

956
01:10:28.419 --> 01:10:29.884
the Oni.

957
01:10:29.951 --> 01:10:31.051
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

958
01:10:31.119 --> 01:10:32.818
I have a tail.

959
01:10:32.884 --> 01:10:34.818
No one's planning on
stealing my tail, right?

960
01:10:34.884 --> 01:10:37.351
Will you please shut up?

961
01:10:37.418 --> 01:10:40.618
There's more going on and
I think it's all connected.

962
01:10:40.683 --> 01:10:44.151
More what?

963
01:10:44.218 --> 01:10:46.783
Well, someone's
been setting fires.

964
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:48.350
If Allison catches up to Eli,

965
01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:49.717
we might need
some real medical attention,

966
01:10:49.783 --> 01:10:51.450
not just a blow torch.

967
01:10:51.517 --> 01:10:54.217
I feel like that
was aimed at me.

968
01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:56.416
Get out of the way or
there'll be a gun aimed at you.

969
01:10:56.482 --> 01:10:57.616
Of course.

970
01:10:57.682 --> 01:11:01.182
Just satisfy my curiosity
about one thing.

971
01:11:01.249 --> 01:11:03.648
Who are you going out there
to help,

972
01:11:03.715 --> 01:11:06.815
her or him, predator or prey?

973
01:11:06.881 --> 01:11:10.215
I'll stop anyone who tries to
kill an innocent 15-year-old.

974
01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:11.947
And yet you look like
a man with doubts.

975
01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:13.248
Let's ask the expert.

976
01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:15.248
Mr. Deaton?

977
01:11:18.747 --> 01:11:20.247
The Nogitsune is
an extraordinarily

978
01:11:20.314 --> 01:11:21.547
powerful creature.

979
01:11:21.614 --> 01:11:23.180
It can create illusions

980
01:11:23.247 --> 01:11:25.547
that are nearly
indistinguishable from reality.

981
01:11:25.613 --> 01:11:27.114
Illusion.

982
01:11:27.147 --> 01:11:29.913
But that illusion today,

983
01:11:29.979 --> 01:11:32.945
that looked pretty damn real
to me.

984
01:11:34.413 --> 01:11:35.513
Me too.

985
01:11:35.579 --> 01:11:36.945
I know what I saw.

986
01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:46.345
I saw an exact replica,

987
01:11:46.412 --> 01:11:50.344
meant to trick us
into lowering our guard.

988
01:11:50.411 --> 01:11:52.477
My daughter is gone.

989
01:11:52.544 --> 01:11:58.177
Whoever or whatever is out there
isn't Allison.

990
01:11:58.244 --> 01:11:59.876
It's an illusion.

991
01:11:59.943 --> 01:12:03.010
Then I say,
let's dispel the illusion.

992
01:13:55.533 --> 01:13:56.833
Allison, stop!

993
01:14:01.965 --> 01:14:05.532
Come on! Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

994
01:14:05.599 --> 01:14:07.799
Ah!
- Oh, shit.

995
01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:09.365
OK. Go.

996
01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.964
Oh! Ah, come on!

997
01:14:14.099 --> 01:14:15.298
Come on! Let's go!
- OK. OK.

998
01:14:15.364 --> 01:14:17.099
I know you don't
remember everything,

999
01:14:17.164 --> 01:14:18.598
but if you stop trying to
kill us for half a second,

1000
01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:20.098
I could help you remember!

1001
01:14:24.797 --> 01:14:26.830
Come on! All right! Hey!

1002
01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:28.074
We're gonna have to run.

1003
01:14:28.098 --> 01:14:29.663
I need you to heal.
- I can't.

1004
01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:31.097
I can't heal. I can't transform.

1005
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:32.263
I can't do any of it.

1006
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:34.130
Well, you're gonna learn
right now.

1007
01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:36.429
How?

1008
01:14:36.496 --> 01:14:38.329
Like this.

1009
01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.394
We've got multiple calls
about a fire.

1010
01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.070
- Copy, Dispatch.
We're en route now.

1011
01:15:03.094 --> 01:15:06.594
Parrish, go to two.

1012
01:15:06.659 --> 01:15:08.593
I'll hit the station.

1013
01:15:08.659 --> 01:15:10.094
But, Sheriff,

1014
01:15:10.127 --> 01:15:12.993
Mason, he just... he vanished.

1015
01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:15.393
We don't know
what happened to him yet.

1016
01:15:15.459 --> 01:15:17.992
Right now,
I need you at the station.

1017
01:15:18.093 --> 01:15:19.126
I'll check Hale Auto.

1018
01:15:19.193 --> 01:15:21.425
You copy me?

1019
01:15:21.492 --> 01:15:23.093
Copy, sir.

1020
01:15:27.158 --> 01:15:30.192
- Come on, Eli! Don't stop!
She's right behind us.

1021
01:15:31.924 --> 01:15:33.924
Come on, keep going.

1022
01:15:33.991 --> 01:15:35.091
Kid, come on, get up, get up!

1023
01:15:35.124 --> 01:15:38.457
Go, go, go! Right there, go!

1024
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:45.124
Listen, you're gonna have to
keep going on without me.

1025
01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:46.356
Wait, what are you
talking about?

1026
01:15:46.423 --> 01:15:47.690
I have to try to
get through to her.

1027
01:15:47.756 --> 01:15:50.590
She's trying to get
an arrow through you.

1028
01:15:55.655 --> 01:15:57.455
What is that?

1029
01:15:57.522 --> 01:15:59.189
Wolfsbane.

1030
01:15:59.255 --> 01:16:00.988
She coated the arrowheads
in wolfsbane.

1031
01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:02.888
My dad told me you almost
had to cut his arm off once

1032
01:16:02.954 --> 01:16:04.988
because of wolfsbane poisoning.

1033
01:16:05.089 --> 01:16:06.454
You need to run, Eli.

1034
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.554
We're not far from the road.
I... I'll keep her busy.

1035
01:16:08.621 --> 01:16:11.920
- I can't. OK?
I can't do it without you.

1036
01:16:11.987 --> 01:16:14.288
Hey, you're gonna be
all right, OK?

1037
01:16:14.354 --> 01:16:15.620
Remember, you just learned
how to heal.

1038
01:16:15.687 --> 01:16:16.753
You did that for me.

1039
01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.587
I gave you a push.

1040
01:16:18.653 --> 01:16:21.420
And if Allison has any chance
of remembering who she is,

1041
01:16:21.487 --> 01:16:23.952
she's gonna need the same push.

1042
01:16:24.087 --> 01:16:25.253
Find your dad.

1043
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.552
I think I'm gonna need his help.

1044
01:16:26.619 --> 01:16:29.087
Yeah, OK.

1045
01:16:33.386 --> 01:16:35.086
Yeah, the fires all happened

1046
01:16:35.152 --> 01:16:37.951
right after the jar
was taken from Japan.

1047
01:16:38.086 --> 01:16:40.152
Liam, that's him.

1048
01:16:40.218 --> 01:16:41.185
That's the guy
who stole the jar,

1049
01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:43.151
the one who freed the Nogitsune.

1050
01:16:43.218 --> 01:16:44.817
He's the one setting the fires.

1051
01:16:44.884 --> 01:16:46.850
And not the Nogitsune?

1052
01:16:46.917 --> 01:16:49.251
Why don't we catch him
and kill the Nogitsune?

1053
01:16:49.318 --> 01:16:50.584
That sounds like
a pretty good plan to me.

1054
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:52.484
Well, the Nogitsune's
not a person.

1055
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:56.450
It's an ancient power, so old
it's practically elemental.

1056
01:16:56.517 --> 01:16:58.284
It might not be possible
to kill him.

1057
01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:00.749
Well, I'm willing
to give it a shot.

1058
01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:03.483
We're wasting time.

1059
01:17:03.549 --> 01:17:05.083
You guys can figure out
who's starting the fire.

1060
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:06.815
We need to find Scott.

1061
01:17:25.714 --> 01:17:29.081
She drove this one,
smashed right into Derek's.

1062
01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.181
You smell something else?

1063
01:17:34.913 --> 01:17:37.080
Anger.

1064
01:17:37.113 --> 01:17:39.413
The air, it's rife
with a homicidal rage.

1065
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.380
She certainly has the anger
of an Argent.

1066
01:17:41.446 --> 01:17:44.180
Then it's more proof
it's not Allison.

1067
01:17:44.246 --> 01:17:46.213
My daughter wouldn't kill
a 15-year-old boy.

1068
01:17:46.279 --> 01:17:47.812
You had the Nogitsune
in your head.

1069
01:17:47.879 --> 01:17:48.979
Maybe it's in hers.

1070
01:17:49.079 --> 01:17:50.212
If there's room enough,

1071
01:17:50.279 --> 01:17:52.055
with all of that
unadulterated fury.

1072
01:17:52.079 --> 01:17:54.644
Not everybody has your anger.

1073
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.478
Not everyone has your optimism.

1074
01:17:56.544 --> 01:17:58.544
Don't underestimate anger,
Melissa.

1075
01:17:58.611 --> 01:18:00.344
We all have the same instinct
for fight or flight.

1076
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:04.777
Flight begins with fear
but fight is born of anger.

1077
01:18:04.843 --> 01:18:06.344
She put an arrow into his truck.

1078
01:18:06.411 --> 01:18:09.443
They're on the run, that way.

1079
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:10.943
Can you track 'em
through the woods?

1080
01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:12.510
Both: Yes.

1081
01:18:20.776 --> 01:18:22.509
Allison, stop!

1082
01:18:38.075 --> 01:18:40.175
I want to talk.

1083
01:18:41.108 --> 01:18:42.740
Sure, let's talk.

1084
01:18:46.174 --> 01:18:47.706
Dad? Dad?

1085
01:18:47.773 --> 01:18:48.973
Eli?

1086
01:18:49.074 --> 01:18:50.473
Eli!

1087
01:18:53.673 --> 01:18:54.873
You're safe, Eli.

1088
01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:56.373
You're safe.

1089
01:18:56.439 --> 01:18:57.972
Yeah, but Scott isn't.

1090
01:18:58.073 --> 01:19:00.139
Hey, we got a problem.

1091
01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:03.206
Three of them.

1092
01:19:18.571 --> 01:19:20.571
It was done by a sword.

1093
01:20:14.032 --> 01:20:15.366
Hikari!

1094
01:20:57.628 --> 01:20:58.828
Dad!

1095
01:21:16.493 --> 01:21:18.660
Oh, no!

1096
01:21:21.193 --> 01:21:22.560
Deaton!

1097
01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.125
Dad...

1098
01:21:47.623 --> 01:21:49.790
Remember who you are.

1099
01:21:58.157 --> 01:22:01.322
- Malia?
- Come on. Come on!

1100
01:22:13.788 --> 01:22:15.521
Allison, if you just
give me one second,

1101
01:22:15.588 --> 01:22:17.755
I can tell you the truth.
- You killed half my family.

1102
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.620
I never killed anyone,
and neither did you.

1103
01:22:25.654 --> 01:22:28.919
I know those daggers
have wolfsbane on them.

1104
01:22:29.054 --> 01:22:31.054
And I know you think you're
gonna go through with it.

1105
01:22:34.519 --> 01:22:36.319
Because that's what
the Nogitsune wants.

1106
01:22:36.386 --> 01:22:40.029
He wants me to die
in your arms this time.

1107
01:22:40.053 --> 01:22:42.053
Are you ready for that?

1108
01:22:42.119 --> 01:22:44.086
Because it's not easy.

1109
01:22:44.618 --> 01:22:47.318
Come on.

1110
01:22:54.717 --> 01:22:57.085
Eli, what are you doing?

1111
01:22:57.152 --> 01:22:59.051
- I can do this.
- Oh, shit!

1112
01:23:01.384 --> 01:23:03.051
No!

1113
01:23:19.183 --> 01:23:20.882
Eli.

1114
01:23:25.449 --> 01:23:26.914
Whoa, OK, stop!

1115
01:23:27.049 --> 01:23:29.514
What's it gonna take to
get you to stop and listen?

1116
01:23:55.079 --> 01:23:57.246
OK, you killed me.

1117
01:23:57.312 --> 01:23:58.945
Now can we talk?

1118
01:23:59.046 --> 01:24:01.911
Why is the guy who went to
Japan to free the Nogitsune

1119
01:24:02.046 --> 01:24:03.845
now in Beacon Hills trying
to burn down the woods?

1120
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:05.245
He's not trying to
burn down the woods.

1121
01:24:05.311 --> 01:24:08.844
It's... only part of it.

1122
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.710
Do we have to play
junior detectives?

1123
01:24:10.777 --> 01:24:13.078
Can't we just leave it up
to the actual detectives?

1124
01:24:13.145 --> 01:24:15.477
Do you see any actual
detectives standing around?

1125
01:24:18.876 --> 01:24:21.609
But what do detectives do,
anyway?

1126
01:24:21.676 --> 01:24:24.244
Do they, like, go to
the scene of the crime and...

1127
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.576
detect something?

1128
01:24:28.609 --> 01:24:30.908
That's exactly what they do.

1129
01:24:31.043 --> 01:24:33.309
We need to look at
one of the burn sites,

1130
01:24:33.376 --> 01:24:35.309
the first one.

1131
01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:36.908
Guys, guys.

1132
01:24:37.043 --> 01:24:38.375
Hi.

1133
01:24:38.442 --> 01:24:40.108
We got a big-ass problem.

1134
01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:43.575
Derek, Stilinski, Eli, Deaton,
they're all gone.

1135
01:24:43.641 --> 01:24:44.641
What do you mean gone?

1136
01:24:44.707 --> 01:24:46.175
They were taken.

1137
01:24:46.242 --> 01:24:47.841
By who?

1138
01:24:48.907 --> 01:24:50.541
The Oni.

1139
01:25:00.473 --> 01:25:03.373
There's blood...

1140
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.939
all around here, and a lot.

1141
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.040
If she managed to cut him
with her ring dagger

1142
01:25:08.106 --> 01:25:09.705
then he's in trouble.

1143
01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.272
They're laced with wolfsbane.

1144
01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:12.705
How long does he have?

1145
01:25:12.772 --> 01:25:15.205
Six, eight hours at most.

1146
01:25:23.838 --> 01:25:25.704
These rapid burns...

1147
01:25:29.837 --> 01:25:32.737
There is something
systematic about it.

1148
01:25:32.803 --> 01:25:34.403
Is she gonna keep
talking like this?

1149
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:37.137
I stopped listening
six hours ago.

1150
01:25:37.203 --> 01:25:38.669
All right. I'm sorry.

1151
01:25:38.736 --> 01:25:39.702
I'm not gonna spend
the rest of the day

1152
01:25:39.769 --> 01:25:40.702
walking through the woods,

1153
01:25:40.769 --> 01:25:42.436
trying to catch a pyromaniac.

1154
01:25:42.502 --> 01:25:43.902
Do you have a better plan?

1155
01:25:44.037 --> 01:25:45.936
We already know
what kills the Oni.

1156
01:25:46.036 --> 01:25:47.569
Silver.

1157
01:25:47.636 --> 01:25:48.935
You with me?

1158
01:25:49.036 --> 01:25:50.668
- Go.
Get all the silver you can.

1159
01:25:50.735 --> 01:25:52.835
And if you find the Oni,
don't fight them, kill them.

1160
01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:13.134
We're heading back to
the main road, aren't we?

1161
01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:19.666
And my blood,
it's going to lure them.

1162
01:26:19.733 --> 01:26:21.865
I'm the bait for
the trap, right?

1163
01:26:24.133 --> 01:26:27.798
'Cause by the time the others
catch up to us, I'll be dead,

1164
01:26:27.865 --> 01:26:29.232
and you can pick the others
off one by one.

1165
01:26:29.298 --> 01:26:31.532
Is that the plan?

1166
01:26:31.598 --> 01:26:33.298
- Yeah, actually.
That is the plan.

1167
01:26:35.797 --> 01:26:37.864
You don't hunt werewolves,
Allison.

1168
01:26:37.931 --> 01:26:40.331
And no matter what the Nogitsune
put into your head,

1169
01:26:40.397 --> 01:26:42.431
you don't kill them either.

1170
01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:43.863
And I think part of you
knows it.

1171
01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:46.064
I saw it the moment
you stabbed me.

1172
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:48.863
Saw what?

1173
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:50.031
Regret.

1174
01:26:53.096 --> 01:26:55.596
Go.

1175
01:26:58.895 --> 01:27:02.595
Jackson, what do you smell?

1176
01:27:02.662 --> 01:27:04.562
Ugh. The horrifying
stench of death.

1177
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:06.728
What else do you smell?

1178
01:27:11.162 --> 01:27:13.161
It's not gas.

1179
01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:16.128
It's not lighter fluid
or anything like that.

1180
01:27:16.194 --> 01:27:17.727
It's different.

1181
01:27:17.793 --> 01:27:20.361
Chemical accelerant.

1182
01:27:20.428 --> 01:27:22.028
Mm-hmm. It's a quick burn

1183
01:27:22.094 --> 01:27:24.660
so they can't set
the rest of the forest on fire.

1184
01:27:24.727 --> 01:27:27.060
Well, does that tell us
anything useful?

1185
01:27:27.127 --> 01:27:31.193
Well, in terms of the fire,
they know chemicals.

1186
01:27:34.559 --> 01:27:36.592
They know exactly
how to use them.

1187
01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:38.292
- I don't get it.
Why would someone

1188
01:27:38.359 --> 01:27:41.725
spend all this time and energy
burning up rowan trees?

1189
01:27:41.791 --> 01:27:43.259
- Rowan trees?
- Yeah.

1190
01:27:43.326 --> 01:27:45.002
That's what the smell is, right?

1191
01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.325
Jackson, do you know
what rowan trees become

1192
01:27:46.391 --> 01:27:47.591
after they're burned?

1193
01:27:47.658 --> 01:27:49.791
Ash?

1194
01:27:53.425 --> 01:27:55.325
Mountain ash.

1195
01:28:02.024 --> 01:28:04.889
You're not gonna kill me.

1196
01:28:05.024 --> 01:28:09.223
That's right. The wolfsbane is
going to kill you.

1197
01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:10.689
You had a code.

1198
01:28:10.756 --> 01:28:12.056
Mm-hmm.

1199
01:28:12.123 --> 01:28:13.423
"We hunt those who hunt us."

1200
01:28:13.489 --> 01:28:16.722
No.

1201
01:28:16.788 --> 01:28:19.655
You came up with a new one.

1202
01:28:19.722 --> 01:28:23.854
"We protect..."
- "We protect those who...

1203
01:28:23.921 --> 01:28:26.587
cannot protect themselves."

1204
01:28:26.654 --> 01:28:28.754
You remember.

1205
01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.253
We should grab whatever we can.

1206
01:28:51.619 --> 01:28:53.685
I'm taking this.

1207
01:28:57.185 --> 01:28:58.485
- Don't worry.
It's not the look.

1208
01:28:58.552 --> 01:29:00.319
It's more of a...

1209
01:29:00.385 --> 01:29:03.218
"you look really hot holding
a tactical tomahawk" look.

1210
01:29:10.683 --> 01:29:14.184
If we don't die tonight,
we can talk about it.

1211
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.417
Huh.

1212
01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:18.117
Then I'm definitely not
dying tonight.

1213
01:29:43.415 --> 01:29:46.547
Scott.

1214
01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.148
Yes, he's handsome.

1215
01:29:48.214 --> 01:29:50.847
History is replete
with handsome killers.

1216
01:29:50.913 --> 01:29:52.514
He's still a killer.

1217
01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.813
What am I even doing here?

1218
01:29:53.879 --> 01:29:56.479
This... this can't be
the right thing to do.

1219
01:29:56.546 --> 01:29:59.379
Don't get lost in useless
moral quandaries, Allison.

1220
01:29:59.446 --> 01:30:01.013
Stick to the plan.

1221
01:30:01.079 --> 01:30:03.079
Your father is on his way here
right now.

1222
01:30:03.146 --> 01:30:05.379
- I saw him at the hospital.
That was him.

1223
01:30:05.446 --> 01:30:09.979
No, he's on his way and
he's bringing Peter Hale.

1224
01:30:10.046 --> 01:30:12.012
You remember what
that monster did to Kate?

1225
01:30:12.078 --> 01:30:14.911
He ripped her throat out
with his claws.

1226
01:30:14.978 --> 01:30:17.278
He'll do the same to you
if he gets the chance.

1227
01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:19.777
Don't you remember
how they burned us?

1228
01:30:19.844 --> 01:30:22.244
We lost years.

1229
01:30:22.311 --> 01:30:27.943
Can't you feel that life
stolen from you?

1230
01:30:28.011 --> 01:30:29.411
I don't know what I feel!

1231
01:30:29.476 --> 01:30:31.310
A few more hours
and the sun goes down.

1232
01:30:31.376 --> 01:30:33.510
We'll take care
of everything then.

1233
01:30:33.576 --> 01:30:35.909
They come out at night.

1234
01:30:35.976 --> 01:30:39.043
- Who?
- The Oni.

1235
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:43.775
And with them comes chaos.

1236
01:30:52.175 --> 01:30:54.341
Eli.

1237
01:30:54.408 --> 01:30:56.374
Eli, can you hear me?

1238
01:31:14.373 --> 01:31:15.872
We're not dead.

1239
01:31:16.007 --> 01:31:18.406
Not yet.

1240
01:31:20.472 --> 01:31:21.472
Where are we?

1241
01:31:21.539 --> 01:31:23.805
It's just an illusion.

1242
01:31:38.005 --> 01:31:40.170
What about them?

1243
01:32:03.335 --> 01:32:06.035
If we don't come up with a way
to get this wolfsbane out soon,

1244
01:32:06.102 --> 01:32:09.701
I'm going to die.

1245
01:32:09.767 --> 01:32:11.634
We need to find Liam.

1246
01:32:11.701 --> 01:32:13.002
Your beta?

1247
01:32:13.068 --> 01:32:15.634
My friend.

1248
01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:17.401
Liam and Hikari.

1249
01:32:17.467 --> 01:32:19.167
She's a kitsune.

1250
01:32:19.234 --> 01:32:22.034
That's why that arrow
didn't do anything to her.

1251
01:32:22.101 --> 01:32:23.900
Because of the fox.

1252
01:32:24.001 --> 01:32:26.100
It protects her, like armor.

1253
01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:28.600
It won't protect her
from the Oni.

1254
01:32:28.666 --> 01:32:30.333
Nothing protected you either.

1255
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.265
- What do you mean?
- You died in my arms.

1256
01:32:38.065 --> 01:32:41.165
And if you let me,
I could prove it to you.

1257
01:32:43.431 --> 01:32:45.498
You're lying.

1258
01:32:45.564 --> 01:32:47.998
Just give me a chance.

1259
01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:55.763
If you still
don't believe me, fine.

1260
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:57.998
Let me die.

1261
01:32:59.130 --> 01:33:01.030
And what if I do?

1262
01:33:01.097 --> 01:33:03.397
Well, then you're gonna
have to save me.

1263
01:33:07.662 --> 01:33:10.296
Derek, I'm not so sure
even your strength

1264
01:33:10.362 --> 01:33:13.096
could break those bonds,
not here.

1265
01:33:13.162 --> 01:33:14.396
Eli, are you OK?

1266
01:33:14.462 --> 01:33:15.996
How's your leg?

1267
01:33:16.029 --> 01:33:17.528
Yeah, it's fine.

1268
01:33:17.595 --> 01:33:18.972
It's healed.

1269
01:33:18.996 --> 01:33:20.061
You learn how to heal?

1270
01:33:20.128 --> 01:33:21.128
Yeah, kind of.

1271
01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:22.661
Well, Scott did most of it.

1272
01:33:22.728 --> 01:33:24.794
That's amazing!

1273
01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.295
Hey, Derek.

1274
01:33:26.361 --> 01:33:27.427
Maybe you want to be
a little more subtle

1275
01:33:27.494 --> 01:33:30.194
with your antics.

1276
01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.594
The Nogitsune isn't gonna
kill us, not yet.

1277
01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:36.559
He put us here to watch him win.

1278
01:33:36.626 --> 01:33:38.493
We're here for our pain.

1279
01:33:43.193 --> 01:33:44.858
Do you guys hear that?

1280
01:33:49.658 --> 01:33:51.725
It sounds like...

1281
01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:53.425
Lacrosse.

1282
01:34:10.324 --> 01:34:11.967
At least we know
she hasn't caught him yet.

1283
01:34:11.991 --> 01:34:14.157
No, she's caught him.

1284
01:34:14.223 --> 01:34:16.556
Allison knows to retrieve
her arrows whenever she can.

1285
01:34:16.623 --> 01:34:18.990
This was left so we're
following the right trail.

1286
01:34:19.056 --> 01:34:20.589
Guys.

1287
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:25.255
I don't think
we're following a trail.

1288
01:34:25.322 --> 01:34:27.689
We're being led into a trap,
and I think that's it.

1289
01:34:27.755 --> 01:34:28.989
It's the college stadium.

1290
01:34:29.055 --> 01:34:31.122
That's where the lacrosse
tournament's being held.

1291
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:32.588
And while they play
a lacrosse game,

1292
01:34:32.654 --> 01:34:36.521
we'll be playing right
into the Nogitsune's game.

1293
01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:38.821
That's where he'll make
his final moves.

1294
01:34:38.888 --> 01:34:40.964
Let's just hope he hasn't
figured out a divine move.

1295
01:34:40.988 --> 01:34:42.154
What's that?

1296
01:34:42.221 --> 01:34:43.620
It's a move in the game of Go.

1297
01:34:43.687 --> 01:34:48.088
It's a move so brilliant,
so inspired,

1298
01:34:48.153 --> 01:34:49.620
that it changes the shape
of the entire game.

1299
01:34:49.687 --> 01:34:53.619
A move that only a god
could make.

1300
01:34:53.686 --> 01:34:55.187
Divine.

1301
01:35:00.552 --> 01:35:02.785
I think the accelerant
used to start these fires

1302
01:35:02.851 --> 01:35:06.052
might be the same one used to
start a fire over 20 years ago.

1303
01:35:06.119 --> 01:35:08.751
Are you talking about the fire
that killed Derek's family?

1304
01:35:08.818 --> 01:35:11.518
And there's one more thing.

1305
01:35:11.585 --> 01:35:14.717
The person who came up with this
formula is supposed to be dead.

1306
01:35:14.784 --> 01:35:16.285
"Supposed to be dead"
is starting to be

1307
01:35:16.351 --> 01:35:17.985
a recurring theme around here.

1308
01:35:42.582 --> 01:35:45.248
Just... hold on.

1309
01:35:46.748 --> 01:35:48.615
Please.

1310
01:35:58.147 --> 01:35:59.780
It's my license.

1311
01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.679
It was at the ice rink.

1312
01:36:10.745 --> 01:36:11.980
The other pictures
didn't come out

1313
01:36:12.013 --> 01:36:14.845
so I tore that one off for you.

1314
01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:16.812
After you died,

1315
01:36:16.879 --> 01:36:20.112
your father gave that to me.

1316
01:36:23.112 --> 01:36:25.878
Lydia was there.

1317
01:36:25.979 --> 01:36:27.478
And Stiles.

1318
01:36:29.811 --> 01:36:32.344
Remember the winter formal?

1319
01:36:35.044 --> 01:36:36.978
I went with my friends,

1320
01:36:37.044 --> 01:36:40.110
Jackson and Lydia.

1321
01:36:40.177 --> 01:36:42.842
I don't remember anybody else.

1322
01:36:42.977 --> 01:36:44.776
I was there.

1323
01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:50.609
And I found you inside,
and we danced.

1324
01:36:54.176 --> 01:36:56.476
I don't remember any of that.

1325
01:36:58.641 --> 01:37:00.641
We kissed.

1326
01:37:03.241 --> 01:37:06.275
And that was the first time
I told you that I loved you.

1327
01:37:09.474 --> 01:37:11.740
Why did you do that?

1328
01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.274
Because I love you.

1329
01:37:15.574 --> 01:37:16.773
When you broke up with me,

1330
01:37:16.839 --> 01:37:21.839
I said I knew we were
gonna be together.

1331
01:37:21.974 --> 01:37:25.139
And you told me...

1332
01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:27.639
"There's no such thing as fate."

1333
01:37:31.472 --> 01:37:34.505
Do you remember what
I told you back?

1334
01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:42.604
"There's no such thing
as a werewolf."

1335
01:37:48.104 --> 01:37:49.604
Tell me the rest.

1336
01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:52.870
I can't, because I'm going
to die if you don't help me.

1337
01:37:52.971 --> 01:37:55.171
What do I have to do?

1338
01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:58.136
Wolfsbane only responds to fire.

1339
01:37:58.203 --> 01:38:01.769
You've got to burn it out.

1340
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:10.269
A man looks at a photograph
of another man.

1341
01:38:10.335 --> 01:38:15.235
He says, "Brothers and sisters
have I none.

1342
01:38:15.302 --> 01:38:21.668
But this man's father
is my father's son."

1343
01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:28.234
Who is the man
in the photograph?

1344
01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.700
My son.

1345
01:38:29.767 --> 01:38:31.333
Ah.

1346
01:38:36.233 --> 01:38:37.967
Don't be afraid.

1347
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.699
Oh, of this guy? No, no way.

1348
01:38:40.766 --> 01:38:44.399
Oh, my God, he's touching me.

1349
01:38:44.466 --> 01:38:48.299
The son of Derek Hale.

1350
01:38:48.366 --> 01:38:53.765
But not a wolf yet, is he?

1351
01:38:53.831 --> 01:38:56.298
When night falls,

1352
01:38:56.365 --> 01:39:00.730
he may earn his fangs,
his claws,

1353
01:39:00.797 --> 01:39:03.164
watching the rest of you die!

1354
01:39:16.863 --> 01:39:18.396
Whoa, uh...

1355
01:39:18.463 --> 01:39:22.129
you couldn't find a lighter?

1356
01:39:22.196 --> 01:39:25.029
Do you want to live or not?

1357
01:39:26.128 --> 01:39:28.162
Burn it out.

1358
01:40:07.225 --> 01:40:08.824
Eli, did you see that?

1359
01:40:08.891 --> 01:40:10.391
Did you see your eyes?

1360
01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:11.491
How the hell am I supposed
to see my eyes?

1361
01:40:11.558 --> 01:40:12.691
They're the things I use to see.

1362
01:40:12.758 --> 01:40:14.924
- They were glowing.
- What?

1363
01:40:14.991 --> 01:40:16.124
They were?
- Yes.

1364
01:40:20.091 --> 01:40:21.423
Oh.

1365
01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:23.123
Wait, don't!

1366
01:40:24.257 --> 01:40:27.923
Tell me, Eli,

1367
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:29.556
do you like riddles?

1368
01:40:29.622 --> 01:40:30.889
I'm more of a limerick
kind of guy.

1369
01:40:30.957 --> 01:40:33.456
You know, I like the rhyming.

1370
01:40:34.822 --> 01:40:37.821
Finstock, thanks for
reminding everyone here

1371
01:40:37.888 --> 01:40:40.821
that no team chokes
quite like Beacon Hills.

1372
01:40:40.888 --> 01:40:41.989
We're still up, Hogan.

1373
01:40:43.688 --> 01:40:44.621
Shit!

1374
01:40:50.321 --> 01:40:51.487
I need to find my father.

1375
01:40:51.554 --> 01:40:53.687
If he's here,
he's in danger too.

1376
01:40:55.087 --> 01:40:58.454
Allison, wait.

1377
01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.819
Look, this isn't
just about us anymore.

1378
01:41:03.653 --> 01:41:06.053
I think I remember you,

1379
01:41:06.119 --> 01:41:07.586
or maybe someone like you,

1380
01:41:07.653 --> 01:41:09.386
maybe someone
I was in love with.

1381
01:41:09.453 --> 01:41:12.453
And maybe...
Maybe if I had more time,

1382
01:41:12.518 --> 01:41:13.953
I would remember everything.

1383
01:41:14.019 --> 01:41:16.785
But I can't help you right now.
I have to find my father.

1384
01:41:16.852 --> 01:41:20.052
I think he might be
the only one I have left.

1385
01:41:20.118 --> 01:41:21.585
Yeah.

1386
01:41:31.184 --> 01:41:36.716
Let's put one of the players
back in the game.

1387
01:41:36.783 --> 01:41:38.951
No!

1388
01:41:57.514 --> 01:42:00.714
- Allison.
Hey! Allison, Allison.

1389
01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:02.214
They don't know that it's you.

1390
01:42:02.281 --> 01:42:04.181
Not even your own father.

1391
01:42:04.248 --> 01:42:06.813
So just...

1392
01:42:06.948 --> 01:42:09.480
be careful.

1393
01:42:09.547 --> 01:42:11.313
I just tried to kill you,

1394
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.713
and you're telling me
to be careful.

1395
01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.413
Why would you do that?

1396
01:42:20.412 --> 01:42:23.379
Because I'm still in love
with you.

1397
01:42:37.478 --> 01:42:38.710
Eli!

1398
01:42:38.777 --> 01:42:40.945
Where the hell
did you come from?

1399
01:42:41.011 --> 01:42:42.245
Get off the... hey!

1400
01:42:42.311 --> 01:42:43.844
Off the field!

1401
01:42:43.945 --> 01:42:46.710
Get off the field! Look at you!

1402
01:42:46.777 --> 01:42:47.944
Eli?

1403
01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:54.944
It's happening now.

1404
01:42:54.977 --> 01:42:57.409
The mountain ash is more
than a barrier.

1405
01:42:57.476 --> 01:42:59.243
It's a gateway between
his world and ours.

1406
01:42:59.309 --> 01:43:02.409
Oh, I really hate when you
say shit like that.

1407
01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:04.642
Isn't it just ash?

1408
01:43:08.675 --> 01:43:10.608
Parrish has to break
the barrier.

1409
01:43:10.675 --> 01:43:12.075
He's the only one
that can do it.

1410
01:43:14.275 --> 01:43:16.374
Jackson.

1411
01:43:16.942 --> 01:43:19.641
OK, so it's a place,
but it's not real.

1412
01:43:19.707 --> 01:43:21.107
They're all there with my dad,

1413
01:43:21.174 --> 01:43:23.074
and they're alive.
- This part of the game?

1414
01:43:23.141 --> 01:43:24.640
It's like he's knocking
pieces off the board.

1415
01:43:24.706 --> 01:43:26.074
So how come he put me
back on it?

1416
01:43:26.141 --> 01:43:27.241
I don't know, but I need to
get you out of here.

1417
01:43:27.306 --> 01:43:28.706
Come on.

1418
01:43:28.773 --> 01:43:31.640
Oh! What the hell was that?

1419
01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:33.573
Mountain ash.

1420
01:43:43.939 --> 01:43:45.605
It's him.

1421
01:43:45.671 --> 01:43:46.972
It's really him.

1422
01:43:47.039 --> 01:43:48.915
It's him who?

1423
01:43:48.939 --> 01:43:50.915
Adrian Harris.

1424
01:43:50.939 --> 01:43:52.771
He kind of looks like
our chemistry teacher.

1425
01:43:52.838 --> 01:43:55.004
I was your chemistry teacher,
Jackson,

1426
01:43:55.071 --> 01:43:56.238
you fucking imbecile.

1427
01:43:57.971 --> 01:44:01.503
- Do it. Scream, Lydia.
Scream like a banshee.

1428
01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:02.703
Oh. Oh, that's right.

1429
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:05.437
You haven't screamed in years,
have you?

1430
01:44:05.503 --> 01:44:06.437
What do you want from us?

1431
01:44:06.503 --> 01:44:08.537
Well, I don't want an apology,

1432
01:44:08.602 --> 01:44:09.970
seeing as how
you ruined my life,

1433
01:44:10.037 --> 01:44:11.769
and you served me up
as a human sacrifice

1434
01:44:11.836 --> 01:44:13.037
to some demented druid.

1435
01:44:13.103 --> 01:44:15.302
I was in London for all of that.

1436
01:44:19.936 --> 01:44:21.535
The sun's going down.

1437
01:44:21.601 --> 01:44:22.735
If the Oni come out at night...

1438
01:44:22.801 --> 01:44:24.735
There's 10,000 people
in this stadium.

1439
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:26.101
What are we supposed to do?

1440
01:44:26.168 --> 01:44:27.535
Come on.

1441
01:44:27.601 --> 01:44:28.800
Hey, Coach?

1442
01:44:28.935 --> 01:44:29.968
- Come on.
- Coach!

1443
01:44:30.035 --> 01:44:31.135
Coach, hey!

1444
01:44:31.201 --> 01:44:32.268
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1445
01:44:32.335 --> 01:44:33.467
Unacceptable.

1446
01:44:33.534 --> 01:44:34.767
You graduated, McCall.

1447
01:44:34.834 --> 01:44:36.334
You're not ruining this for me.

1448
01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.234
Coach, every single person
in this stadium is in danger.

1449
01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.134
Is there any way to get them out
without panicking them?

1450
01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.533
Yeah, you win the game.

1451
01:44:42.599 --> 01:44:44.167
What happens if they tie it up?

1452
01:44:44.234 --> 01:44:45.100
Sudden death.

1453
01:44:45.167 --> 01:44:46.399
Coach,

1454
01:44:46.466 --> 01:44:47.833
there's gonna be
10,000 sudden deaths

1455
01:44:47.934 --> 01:44:49.966
if we don't stop this game.

1456
01:44:55.233 --> 01:44:56.365
Crap!

1457
01:44:56.432 --> 01:44:57.632
I haven't felt this level
of disappointment

1458
01:44:57.698 --> 01:44:59.232
since I lost my virginity.

1459
01:44:59.298 --> 01:45:00.832
You want to help us win, McCall?

1460
01:45:04.132 --> 01:45:06.032
Here.

1461
01:45:12.964 --> 01:45:16.907
Four minutes,
whoever scores first wins.

1462
01:45:16.931 --> 01:45:19.363
- Number 11?
That used to be my number.

1463
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:20.496
Do you want it back?

1464
01:45:20.563 --> 01:45:22.263
No, no. That's OK.

1465
01:45:22.330 --> 01:45:23.663
Just, if you're gonna wear
my number, you better score.

1466
01:45:23.730 --> 01:45:24.906
I'll try.

1467
01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:26.463
Let's go! Let's do it!

1468
01:45:26.530 --> 01:45:28.363
Asses on the field!

1469
01:45:28.429 --> 01:45:31.195
We score first!

1470
01:45:34.029 --> 01:45:36.495
Come take a look, Lydia.

1471
01:45:37.761 --> 01:45:38.995
This was no small
accomplishment.

1472
01:45:39.062 --> 01:45:40.962
This illusion has
several layers.

1473
01:45:41.029 --> 01:45:43.594
Here, Lydia,
let me show you one.

1474
01:45:43.661 --> 01:45:44.928
You want me to watch
a lacrosse game?

1475
01:45:44.961 --> 01:45:46.461
No, no.

1476
01:45:46.528 --> 01:45:48.961
I want you to watch
your friends die.

1477
01:45:49.028 --> 01:45:50.493
Come on.

1478
01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.627
Take a look through
the microscope.

1479
01:46:01.826 --> 01:46:03.292
You didn't change.

1480
01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:06.192
What?

1481
01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.326
When they took Eli,

1482
01:46:07.392 --> 01:46:09.226
you didn't change.

1483
01:46:09.292 --> 01:46:13.391
He means you didn't transform
in front of your son.

1484
01:46:13.458 --> 01:46:14.825
I haven't.

1485
01:46:14.926 --> 01:46:18.658
He hasn't seen me like that.

1486
01:46:18.725 --> 01:46:20.690
Not since the first time.

1487
01:46:20.757 --> 01:46:23.058
OK, what was the first time?

1488
01:46:23.125 --> 01:46:26.624
I don't know
if he'd even remembers.

1489
01:46:26.690 --> 01:46:28.757
He might have been too young.

1490
01:46:28.824 --> 01:46:30.090
Coyotes had come into the house.

1491
01:46:30.157 --> 01:46:32.723
They clawed through
the screen door.

1492
01:46:32.789 --> 01:46:34.157
Eli was playing on the floor,

1493
01:46:34.224 --> 01:46:37.823
and they were heading
straight for him.

1494
01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:41.656
I transformed instantly.

1495
01:46:41.723 --> 01:46:44.788
Roared so loud it shook
the entire house.

1496
01:46:44.923 --> 01:46:49.388
Coyotes took off
and there was Eli,

1497
01:46:49.455 --> 01:46:51.222
looking up at me.

1498
01:46:53.955 --> 01:46:56.288
He was shaking. He was...

1499
01:46:56.355 --> 01:47:00.121
He was terrified.

1500
01:47:00.187 --> 01:47:05.254
And he wouldn't let me
come near him for days.

1501
01:47:05.321 --> 01:47:08.786
That look of fear in his eyes
when he saw me,

1502
01:47:08.921 --> 01:47:10.987
I couldn't get it
out of my head.

1503
01:47:11.054 --> 01:47:14.153
That's why he can't change.

1504
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.953
I think every time
he starts to, or...

1505
01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.896
maybe every time he tries,

1506
01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.352
he must see my face...

1507
01:47:25.419 --> 01:47:27.352
snarling back at him.

1508
01:47:36.684 --> 01:47:38.451
Get it to McCall! To McCall!

1509
01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:41.051
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1510
01:47:47.283 --> 01:47:48.983
Whoa. Sh...

1511
01:47:53.749 --> 01:47:56.382
I knew the Nogitsune
was too chaotic

1512
01:47:56.449 --> 01:47:58.516
to play this game on his own.

1513
01:47:58.582 --> 01:48:01.382
He needed me to help him win.

1514
01:48:01.449 --> 01:48:03.249
All I had to do was
give him my pain.

1515
01:48:03.316 --> 01:48:05.548
Thanks to you and Scott McCall,

1516
01:48:05.615 --> 01:48:06.715
I have plenty.

1517
01:48:06.781 --> 01:48:09.248
We all have pain.

1518
01:48:09.315 --> 01:48:12.115
But Lydia's pain is
particularly appealing

1519
01:48:12.181 --> 01:48:13.614
to a thousand-year-old demon.

1520
01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.514
My pain isn't anything to him.

1521
01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:19.180
On the contrary, heartbreak
is a veritable delicacy

1522
01:48:19.247 --> 01:48:20.147
to the Nogitsune.

1523
01:48:20.214 --> 01:48:22.914
So give him a taste, Lydia.

1524
01:48:22.947 --> 01:48:24.980
Tell us why you left Stiles.

1525
01:48:25.047 --> 01:48:26.446
Give us your pain,

1526
01:48:26.513 --> 01:48:29.579
or the next time,
I shoot Jackson in the head.

1527
01:48:29.646 --> 01:48:31.013
No. Lydia.

1528
01:48:31.079 --> 01:48:32.579
Lydia, don't do it.

1529
01:48:32.646 --> 01:48:34.413
Don't do it!

1530
01:48:34.479 --> 01:48:37.412
I left.

1531
01:48:37.478 --> 01:48:38.712
I left because of a dream.

1532
01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:40.678
What happened in the dream?

1533
01:48:40.745 --> 01:48:42.245
My eyes open...

1534
01:48:45.545 --> 01:48:47.912
And I see broken glass.

1535
01:48:51.012 --> 01:48:53.144
It's from a windshield.

1536
01:48:55.644 --> 01:48:59.077
And I'm crawling
on the pavement.

1537
01:49:01.077 --> 01:49:03.943
I'm trying to reach Stiles.

1538
01:49:06.543 --> 01:49:09.410
There was a crash.

1539
01:49:10.809 --> 01:49:14.142
We'd been thrown from the car.

1540
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:20.409
Except he's not moving.

1541
01:49:21.641 --> 01:49:24.909
He wasn't blinking.

1542
01:49:24.942 --> 01:49:25.909
He wasn't breathing.

1543
01:49:25.974 --> 01:49:28.908
Lydia, it was just a dream.

1544
01:49:28.974 --> 01:49:31.740
Until it happened again.

1545
01:49:31.807 --> 01:49:35.640
And again.

1546
01:49:35.707 --> 01:49:39.040
Becomes this recurring dream

1547
01:49:39.107 --> 01:49:41.107
until I can't tell anymore
that if it's a dream...

1548
01:49:41.173 --> 01:49:42.506
Or a premonition.

1549
01:49:44.007 --> 01:49:45.806
If I was never in
the car with him,

1550
01:49:45.907 --> 01:49:49.939
there wouldn't have to be
a crash.

1551
01:49:50.006 --> 01:49:52.072
And he wouldn't have to die.

1552
01:49:52.139 --> 01:49:54.505
And you wouldn't have to scream.

1553
01:49:54.571 --> 01:49:58.039
Banshees don't scream.

1554
01:49:59.905 --> 01:50:03.171
They wail.

1555
01:50:09.304 --> 01:50:10.404
New plan.

1556
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:11.670
You take the shot.
I'll cover you.

1557
01:50:11.737 --> 01:50:13.204
- Are you kidding?
- No, it's your shot!

1558
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:14.237
Come on.

1559
01:50:14.304 --> 01:50:15.904
Where did this kid come from?

1560
01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:18.237
Is he even in high school?

1561
01:50:18.303 --> 01:50:19.636
That's one of my best students.

1562
01:50:19.703 --> 01:50:20.904
He looks like he's 30.

1563
01:50:20.970 --> 01:50:22.403
Who the hell is that?

1564
01:50:23.835 --> 01:50:25.036
That's Greenberg.

1565
01:50:26.903 --> 01:50:28.969
What do you hear?

1566
01:50:29.036 --> 01:50:31.069
It's like the game's happening
right next to us.

1567
01:50:31.135 --> 01:50:32.935
I can hear it too.

1568
01:50:33.002 --> 01:50:34.468
I think my son's on the field.

1569
01:50:36.035 --> 01:50:37.868
Yes! Take it!

1570
01:50:37.935 --> 01:50:40.367
Eli, take it to the rack!

1571
01:50:48.501 --> 01:50:51.167
Whoo!

1572
01:50:51.234 --> 01:50:52.500
Yes!

1573
01:50:52.733 --> 01:50:53.867
Yes!

1574
01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:57.333
Holy shit!

1575
01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.033
Scott, did you see that?
Did you me score?

1576
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:01.233
My dad was actually right.
I'm actually pretty good.

1577
01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.876
Oh, my God, my dad.

1578
01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.265
This isn't over.

1579
01:51:07.332 --> 01:51:09.399
- We're gonna find the others.
Come on.

1580
01:51:09.465 --> 01:51:11.498
Peter! Wait!

1581
01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:12.932
No! No!

1582
01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.132
No more illusions.

1583
01:51:14.198 --> 01:51:16.731
Where's Scott? Where's my son?

1584
01:51:16.798 --> 01:51:18.064
He's on the field.

1585
01:51:18.131 --> 01:51:19.763
He's trying to save everyone.

1586
01:51:19.898 --> 01:51:21.198
He's playing the game.

1587
01:51:21.264 --> 01:51:23.098
That most definitely
sounds like your son.

1588
01:51:23.164 --> 01:51:24.530
But as for your daughter...

1589
01:51:24.597 --> 01:51:26.497
I forgot to tell you
something, Peter.

1590
01:51:26.563 --> 01:51:28.763
The arrow wasn't the only thing
Allison left behind.

1591
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:39.596
Wolfsbane.

1592
01:51:47.395 --> 01:51:50.495
You think I wouldn't recognize
my own daughter?

1593
01:51:50.561 --> 01:51:52.395
It is you.

1594
01:51:52.461 --> 01:51:53.995
I don't know.

1595
01:51:54.061 --> 01:51:56.061
I don't know who or what I am.

1596
01:51:56.128 --> 01:51:57.660
But my friends are in trouble
and it's all my fault.

1597
01:51:57.727 --> 01:51:59.095
No.

1598
01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.659
Dad, what's that?

1599
01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.426
Allison?

1600
01:52:19.959 --> 01:52:22.926
The real tournament begins.

1601
01:52:26.791 --> 01:52:28.724
Where are we?

1602
01:52:28.791 --> 01:52:30.691
We're in his world.

1603
01:52:34.657 --> 01:52:35.957
This is it.

1604
01:52:36.024 --> 01:52:38.723
They're here.
They're all trapped here.

1605
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:40.391
So are we.

1606
01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:44.390
Something's happening.

1607
01:52:44.456 --> 01:52:46.623
I think it already happened.

1608
01:53:04.788 --> 01:53:07.321
I've killed Oni before.

1609
01:53:07.388 --> 01:53:09.088
Then let's kill a few more.

1610
01:53:28.352 --> 01:53:29.863
You can burn through this,
right?

1611
01:53:29.887 --> 01:53:31.619
You've done it before.

1612
01:53:31.686 --> 01:53:33.186
That was years ago.

1613
01:53:33.252 --> 01:53:34.219
The amount of power
this is gonna take,

1614
01:53:34.286 --> 01:53:36.119
I don't know if I can do it.

1615
01:53:36.186 --> 01:53:37.919
OK. What do you need?

1616
01:53:37.986 --> 01:53:39.119
You need a pep talk?

1617
01:53:39.185 --> 01:53:41.485
One of those "you can do this"
speeches?

1618
01:53:41.551 --> 01:53:44.861
I don't do speeches.
I don't do pep talks.

1619
01:53:44.885 --> 01:53:46.418
I'm not here to boost your ego.

1620
01:53:46.484 --> 01:53:47.885
And I'm not gonna be
your cheerleader.

1621
01:53:47.951 --> 01:53:50.184
So whatever you need to do
to get your shit together,

1622
01:53:50.250 --> 01:53:51.350
you gotta do this for yourself

1623
01:53:51.417 --> 01:53:54.184
and you gotta do this right now.

1624
01:53:54.250 --> 01:53:57.250
You are a hellhound
that burns hellfire.

1625
01:53:57.317 --> 01:53:59.217
Now burn this fucker up!

1626
01:54:22.882 --> 01:54:24.114
We can't get loose.

1627
01:54:24.181 --> 01:54:26.247
Dad.

1628
01:54:26.314 --> 01:54:28.147
Parrish, we need to
buy him more time.

1629
01:54:28.214 --> 01:54:29.414
Go ahead, Lydia.

1630
01:54:29.481 --> 01:54:31.513
Watch your friends suffer.

1631
01:54:36.713 --> 01:54:38.680
Look out!

1632
01:54:52.245 --> 01:54:54.879
Fight, Allison. Come on.

1633
01:54:54.912 --> 01:54:56.611
She'll hear you.

1634
01:54:56.678 --> 01:54:58.879
Mountain ash doesn't work
on banshees.

1635
01:55:21.142 --> 01:55:24.476
Allison is alive.

1636
01:55:24.542 --> 01:55:26.541
Your best friend is alive,

1637
01:55:26.608 --> 01:55:29.109
and she's out there
fighting for her life.

1638
01:55:29.176 --> 01:55:30.942
Don't lose her again.

1639
01:55:31.009 --> 01:55:34.308
She'll hear you.

1640
01:55:34.375 --> 01:55:37.241
Lydia, she'll hear you.

1641
01:55:39.774 --> 01:55:42.008
Allison!

1642
01:57:37.564 --> 01:57:41.130
I remember.

1643
01:57:41.197 --> 01:57:43.363
I remember everything.

1644
01:57:43.429 --> 01:57:47.728
We're not done yet.

1645
01:57:47.863 --> 01:57:52.163
The game is mine.

1646
01:57:58.328 --> 01:57:59.838
Take me.

1647
01:57:59.862 --> 01:58:01.462
Let the others go.

1648
01:58:01.527 --> 01:58:05.862
All the lives here belong to me.

1649
01:58:05.928 --> 01:58:07.027
All you need is me.

1650
01:58:07.094 --> 01:58:09.861
Scott, don't do this.

1651
01:58:09.927 --> 01:58:12.861
Allison kills me,
I die in her arms,

1652
01:58:12.927 --> 01:58:14.760
the same way that
she died in mine.

1653
01:58:14.861 --> 01:58:16.593
That's the move that wins
the game, isn't it?

1654
01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:19.060
I've already won.

1655
01:58:19.126 --> 01:58:22.960
You lose!
Until I'm off the board!

1656
01:58:23.026 --> 01:58:24.860
And I'm still standing.

1657
01:58:24.926 --> 01:58:26.226
And I'm still the alpha.

1658
01:58:26.292 --> 01:58:28.625
An arrow to the heart

1659
01:58:28.692 --> 01:58:32.659
to save everyone else?

1660
01:58:32.724 --> 01:58:36.092
All the other players

1661
01:58:36.159 --> 01:58:38.724
go free.

1662
01:58:49.024 --> 01:58:50.091
No.

1663
01:58:50.157 --> 01:58:52.890
No, I can't.

1664
01:58:52.957 --> 01:58:54.457
I... I can't...

1665
01:58:54.523 --> 01:58:56.323
I cannot... no.

1666
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:58.522
No.

1667
01:58:58.589 --> 01:59:01.389
Kill him, Allison,

1668
01:59:01.456 --> 01:59:04.922
and I win the game.

1669
01:59:04.989 --> 01:59:06.721
Allison, please.

1670
01:59:06.856 --> 01:59:08.956
Don't make me watch
my friends and my family die.

1671
01:59:27.354 --> 01:59:33.120
Game is mine!

1672
01:59:33.187 --> 01:59:36.553
Kill him!

1673
02:00:30.849 --> 02:00:33.148
Something tells me
this isn't over.

1674
02:00:33.214 --> 02:00:36.448
I certainly hope not.

1675
02:00:36.513 --> 02:00:38.248
Scream all you want, Lydia.

1676
02:00:38.314 --> 02:00:40.048
- No!
- The game is over.

1677
02:00:43.413 --> 02:00:47.746
The wolves howl to
signal their position...

1678
02:00:47.813 --> 02:00:51.047
To the rest of the pack.

1679
02:00:51.113 --> 02:00:56.046
Tell me, Scott McCall,

1680
02:00:56.112 --> 02:01:00.112
what is the sound

1681
02:01:00.179 --> 02:01:05.111
of the wolf who is ready to die?

1682
02:01:05.178 --> 02:01:08.211
I'd tell you,

1683
02:01:08.278 --> 02:01:09.845
but I'm not ready to die.

1684
02:01:29.609 --> 02:01:32.243
Fox fire.

1685
02:02:25.703 --> 02:02:27.838
What is that?

1686
02:02:27.871 --> 02:02:30.204
Silver, you motherfucker.

1687
02:03:04.534 --> 02:03:06.467
Come on, come on.

1688
02:03:08.434 --> 02:03:09.934
OK. Stop. Stop.

1689
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.267
The only way we can
break the bonds

1690
02:03:11.334 --> 02:03:13.599
is with our strength combined,
you and me.

1691
02:03:13.666 --> 02:03:15.566
- What strength?
I don't have any strength.

1692
02:03:15.633 --> 02:03:17.099
Your will as a wolf.

1693
02:03:17.166 --> 02:03:19.199
We do it together.

1694
02:03:20.566 --> 02:03:22.966
You're my son.

1695
02:03:23.033 --> 02:03:24.199
You're a Hale.

1696
02:03:28.432 --> 02:03:30.298
A werewolf.

1697
02:03:38.932 --> 02:03:41.264
Go!

1698
02:03:55.562 --> 02:03:57.729
Mason! Sheriff!

1699
02:04:17.528 --> 02:04:18.828
No!

1700
02:04:24.527 --> 02:04:26.827
Do you remember, Scott,

1701
02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:29.803
the gift that you gave me?

1702
02:04:29.827 --> 02:04:34.559
The bite of the alpha,

1703
02:04:34.626 --> 02:04:39.959
the power of the werewolf.

1704
02:05:36.921 --> 02:05:39.620
Derek, it's not real.

1705
02:05:39.686 --> 02:05:41.520
It's just another illusion.

1706
02:05:41.586 --> 02:05:42.520
Dad?

1707
02:05:42.586 --> 02:05:44.486
Eli?

1708
02:05:44.553 --> 02:05:45.853
Eli, can you hear me?

1709
02:05:48.452 --> 02:05:49.452
Yeah.

1710
02:05:49.519 --> 02:05:51.485
Yeah, I can hear you.

1711
02:05:58.819 --> 02:06:00.052
Eli!

1712
02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:23.983
Harris had his chance.

1713
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:26.516
Now it's my turn,

1714
02:06:26.582 --> 02:06:29.582
my revenge.

1715
02:06:29.649 --> 02:06:34.182
I'm going to kill them all,

1716
02:06:34.248 --> 02:06:37.981
starting with this child
right here.

1717
02:06:38.048 --> 02:06:40.815
You wanna kill someone,
start with me!

1718
02:06:48.647 --> 02:06:49.680
We can't fight him alone.

1719
02:06:49.815 --> 02:06:50.980
He's too strong.

1720
02:06:51.047 --> 02:06:52.080
We have to break the illusion.

1721
02:06:52.147 --> 02:06:53.546
We have to catch him.

1722
02:06:53.613 --> 02:06:55.947
You can't catch me.

1723
02:06:56.014 --> 02:06:59.513
You can't kill me.

1724
02:06:59.579 --> 02:07:03.612
You can't even find me.

1725
02:07:03.678 --> 02:07:05.413
You're right.

1726
02:07:05.478 --> 02:07:07.789
We can't find you...

1727
02:07:07.813 --> 02:07:10.212
but we can find each other.

1728
02:07:10.278 --> 02:07:12.788
A wolf howls to signal its pack.

1729
02:07:12.812 --> 02:07:14.378
What about a werewolf?

1730
02:07:15.812 --> 02:07:17.145
A werewolf roars.

1731
02:07:52.341 --> 02:07:54.408
- Hey, hold him!
We gotta hold him!

1732
02:07:54.474 --> 02:07:56.341
- You can't!
You'll both burn up with him!

1733
02:08:15.539 --> 02:08:17.372
- Scott!
- What?

1734
02:08:17.439 --> 02:08:19.172
You're the alpha.

1735
02:08:19.239 --> 02:08:20.639
He's part of your pack now.

1736
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:43.437
Parrish!

1737
02:08:43.504 --> 02:08:44.569
Light this fucker up.

1738
02:09:00.969 --> 02:09:02.102
Dad?

1739
02:10:16.728 --> 02:10:18.395
Here, let me help you.

1740
02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.427
- Hikari!
- Liam!

1741
02:10:56.724 --> 02:10:59.158
- Lydia.
- Allison!

1742
02:11:39.554 --> 02:11:43.587
The first night
I met Derek Hale,

1743
02:11:43.653 --> 02:11:44.687
he saved my life.

1744
02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:49.788
Then he said we were brothers,

1745
02:11:49.853 --> 02:11:54.187
and I thought that he was crazy.

1746
02:11:54.253 --> 02:11:57.386
But no. No, he was right.

1747
02:11:59.552 --> 02:12:03.219
Eli, from that moment on,
we were brothers.

1748
02:12:04.786 --> 02:12:06.685
And, uh...

1749
02:12:06.786 --> 02:12:10.251
Derek Hale was the first person
to teach me that

1750
02:12:10.318 --> 02:12:14.617
you don't just get the family
that you were born with.

1751
02:12:16.517 --> 02:12:18.450
You get the family
that you find.

1752
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:22.984
You know, I'm not sure
how your dad would feel

1753
02:12:23.050 --> 02:12:24.517
about me giving you the Jeep.

1754
02:12:24.584 --> 02:12:29.283
But, um, something tells me
it's the right thing to do.

1755
02:12:29.349 --> 02:12:31.249
He hated that Jeep.

1756
02:12:31.316 --> 02:12:33.649
After my son left it behind,

1757
02:12:33.784 --> 02:12:37.483
Derek towed it in, thinking it
was probably beyond repair.

1758
02:12:37.548 --> 02:12:39.482
But then he opened up the hood
and he pulled off

1759
02:12:39.548 --> 02:12:42.783
all the duct tape
Stiles had stuck on it.

1760
02:12:42.816 --> 02:12:44.648
And he managed to fix it.

1761
02:12:46.515 --> 02:12:48.547
That Jeep,

1762
02:12:48.614 --> 02:12:50.982
no matter
what's been done to it,

1763
02:12:51.048 --> 02:12:53.614
it just keeps running.

1764
02:12:53.681 --> 02:12:56.681
He could never figure out
why it wouldn't break down

1765
02:12:56.781 --> 02:13:00.147
and stay down.

1766
02:13:00.214 --> 02:13:01.446
And I don't think
he ever realized that

1767
02:13:01.513 --> 02:13:04.280
that's exactly
the way we saw him.

1768
02:13:04.346 --> 02:13:07.546
I have never seen anyone

1769
02:13:07.613 --> 02:13:10.780
take the kind of punishment
that Derek Hale took...

1770
02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:15.579
And kept taking...

1771
02:13:16.846 --> 02:13:18.645
In order to protect
the people he loved.

1772
02:13:45.642 --> 02:13:48.309
He kept standing back up...

1773
02:14:02.908 --> 02:14:06.775
Until the day he couldn't.

1774
02:14:06.808 --> 02:14:08.407
Hey.

1775
02:14:08.474 --> 02:14:12.607
Your dad had complicated
feelings about that Jeep.

1776
02:14:12.674 --> 02:14:16.074
But it doesn't mean it needs
to be complicated for you.

1777
02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:19.774
All you got to do...

1778
02:14:19.807 --> 02:14:22.206
is keep it running.

1779
02:14:22.273 --> 02:14:24.873
Just keep it going.

1780
02:14:57.503 --> 02:14:59.603
Don't get too attached.

1781
02:15:01.203 --> 02:15:03.746
We got adoptions on Saturday.

1782
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:05.003
Eventually him.

1783
02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:06.369
I know you're gonna be tempted,

1784
02:15:06.435 --> 02:15:08.969
but not a lot of treats.
He's still growing dog.

1785
02:15:09.035 --> 02:15:10.902
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1786
02:15:10.969 --> 02:15:12.135
He's pretty heavy already.

1787
02:15:12.202 --> 02:15:14.102
When he's ready.

1788
02:15:14.169 --> 02:15:15.568
Hi.

1789
02:15:20.101 --> 02:15:21.634
I have this feeling.

1790
02:15:21.768 --> 02:15:24.234
It's like,
all this time has passed

1791
02:15:24.301 --> 02:15:26.768
and I want to figure out
how to get it back.

1792
02:15:27.467 --> 02:15:29.001
Like, I'm happy for everything
that's ahead of me,

1793
02:15:29.067 --> 02:15:32.167
but I... I just...

1794
02:15:32.233 --> 02:15:36.100
I feel this kind of regret,
you know?

1795
02:15:36.167 --> 02:15:38.743
I think...

1796
02:15:38.767 --> 02:15:40.366
I think I feel...

1797
02:15:42.366 --> 02:15:44.399
Wistful.

1798
02:15:46.966 --> 02:15:48.498
Yeah, that's exactly it.

1799
02:15:51.265 --> 02:15:53.398
Do you feel that way?

1800
02:15:56.865 --> 02:15:58.798
No.

1801
02:16:00.765 --> 02:16:04.130
I'm not worried about the past,

1802
02:16:04.197 --> 02:16:08.330
because now I have a future.

1803
02:16:08.397 --> 02:16:10.930
With him.

1804
02:16:10.997 --> 02:16:12.629
And you.

1805
02:16:22.495 --> 02:16:25.896
OK, quiet.

1806
02:16:45.426 --> 02:16:48.226
Why did we stop?

1807
02:16:48.293 --> 02:16:50.426
Hey, I thought... I thought
I was gonna go see my lawyer.

1808
02:16:53.793 --> 02:16:55.625
Hey.

1809
02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:57.026
Hey!

1810
02:16:57.092 --> 02:16:58.492
Hey, hey, hey!

1811
02:17:05.658 --> 02:17:06.925
Hey.

1812
02:17:06.992 --> 02:17:08.491
Hey!

1813
02:17:08.558 --> 02:17:09.658
Who the hell are you?

1814
02:17:09.759 --> 02:17:11.524
Whoa, whoa, hey! No, hey!

1815
02:17:11.591 --> 02:17:13.358
What's... what's going on?

1816
02:17:17.158 --> 02:17:18.490
Get your hands off me!

1817
02:17:18.557 --> 02:17:22.057
Hey, come on!
Get your hands off...

1818
02:17:22.123 --> 02:17:23.657
Good evening, Mr. Harris.

1819
02:17:23.757 --> 02:17:25.490
There's been a change of plans.

1820
02:17:25.556 --> 02:17:27.456
It's been decided that
you'll be placed at

1821
02:17:27.522 --> 02:17:29.890
a far more suitable
detention facility.

1822
02:17:29.957 --> 02:17:31.222
What kind of facility?

1823
02:17:31.289 --> 02:17:33.422
The Eichen.

1824
02:17:33.489 --> 02:17:35.122
I think you'll be
very comfortable there.

1825
02:17:35.189 --> 02:17:36.555
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1826
02:17:36.621 --> 02:17:39.256
No, God! No, no, no! No!

1827
02:17:39.321 --> 02:17:41.188
No! It's some kind of mistake!

1828
02:17:41.255 --> 02:17:43.355
No! I'm a high school teacher!

1829
02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:45.221
Come on, the kids,
the teenagers,

1830
02:17:45.288 --> 02:17:46.921
they're werewolves!

1831
02:17:46.988 --> 02:17:49.088
Trust me.

1832
02:17:49.155 --> 02:17:52.454
We've heard plenty of stories
about teenage werewolves.

1833
02:17:54.554 --> 02:17:56.487
There's always a new one.

1834
02:18:16.786 --> 02:18:20.085
Remember who you are.
