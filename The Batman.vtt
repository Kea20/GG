00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.508
Hey!

2
00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.079
...a dark
and stormy Halloween.

3
00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.086
Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at- 00.

4
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.712
Our top story tonight,

5
00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.047
just-released polls

6
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.549
have incumbent
Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

7
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.092
and 28-year-old
grassroots challenger

8
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:15.969
Bella Real in a dead heat.

9
00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.762
Things certainly
got hot last night

10
00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.099
in their final debate before
next Tuesday's election.

11
00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.892
Now, my young opponent here

12
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.186
wants to gut
the Gotham Renewal Program,

13
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.105
established by
the great Thomas Wayne.

14
00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.898
Cutting funds
from vital projects

15
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.316
like our seawall,

16
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.484
and the safety net
for those who need it.

17
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.403
The Renewal Program is broken.

18
00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.572
This city's been renewing
for 20 years.

19
00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.533
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.

20
00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.993
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.

21
00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.578
Now wait... Now hang on.

22
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.413
We have a masked vigilante
running the street.

23
00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.831
Under my administration,

24
00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:46.416
the Gotham PD
has dealt major blows

25
00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.418
to organized crime
and drug trafficking.

26
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.919
The Salvatore Maroni case

27
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.838
was the biggest drug bust
in city history.

28
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.132
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.

29
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.592
-It's gotten worse.
-I'm not saying...

30
00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:56.843
I'm not saying
there isn't work to do.

31
00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.469
-But listen...

32
00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.929
...I have a beautiful wife
and young son, okay?

33
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.055
-And I will not rest...

34
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.352
Hey.

35
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:10.565
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

36
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.655
Why is she still tied?

37
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.868
But...

38
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:25.246
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new Post poll.

39
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.463
Okay, you know what?

40
00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.839
I can't...
I can't watch this anymore.

41
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.674
Just call me
in the morning, okay?

42
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.137
...who still believes

43
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.639
in everything
this city can do.

44
00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:43.723
We need a leader,
Mr. Mitchell,

45
00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.308
not a cheerleader.

46
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.644
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.

47
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:09.892
Thursday, October 31st.

48
00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.158
The city streets
are crowded for the holiday.

49
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.912
Even with the rain.

50
00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:37.712
Hidden in the chaos
is the element

51
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:39.964
waiting to strike like snakes.

52
00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.967
But I'm there too.

53
00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.720
Watching.

54
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:49.015
Two years of nights

55
00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.684
have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.

56
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.859
I must choose
my targets carefully.

57
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.290
Come on!

58
00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:16.250
-Give me the money.
-Okay.

59
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.044
{\an5}-Let's go! Let's go!
All right, all right!

60
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:19.712
It's a big city.

61
00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:26.052
I can't be everywhere.

62
00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.523
But they don't know
where I am.

63
00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.446
-Look at this guy, man.

64
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:53.204
-Boom!
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!

65
00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.501
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

66
00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.044
Yo, let's see your hits.

67
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.255
That's you.

68
00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:26.612
We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.

69
00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.284
But when that light
hits the sky,

70
00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:33.452
it's not just a call.

71
00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.581
It's a warning.

72
00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:39.375
To them.

73
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.887
Fear...

74
00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.391
...is a tool.

75
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.862
Are you
out of your mind?

76
00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:09.655
Watch where you're goin',
drophead!

77
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.961
They think
I'm hiding in the shadows.

78
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.007
-Come on!

79
00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.309
But I am the shadows.

80
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.120
Come on, come on.

81
00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.081
Whoo.

82
00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:01.374
-Hey, go on, man! Go!
-Get him!

83
00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:03.668
-Come on, man!
-What are you doin'?

84
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.086
-Help!

85
00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:06.420
Somebody help me!

86
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.215
Help, help!

87
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.515
Where you goin', huh?

88
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.772
-Come on.
-Come on, man. Break it.

89
00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.567
You can't move, huh?

90
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.361
Now knock his ass out.

91
00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:32.655
Showtime. Showtime, man.

92
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:33.823
Come on, man.

93
00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.199
Come on. Do it, man.

94
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.361
You see this guy?

95
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.953
The hell are you
supposed to be?

96
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:39.263
I'm vengeance.

97
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.266
Holy shit. It's him.

98
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.335
Hey, man. No, no, no!

99
00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.169
Please don't hurt me.

100
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.915
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.960
Police action.

102
00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:34.795
He's with me, Officer.

103
00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:39.341
Are you kidding me, sir?

104
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.844
You're gonna let him in here?

105
00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:44.805
Martinez, let him through.

106
00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:00.321
Goddamn freak.

107
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.087
What do we know?

108
00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:29.558
Detective?

109
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.894
Sorry, Lieutenant.

110
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:37.233
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

111
00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:40.611
He got hit a lot of times.
And hard.

112
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.783
All this blood
is from his head?

113
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:46.867
No.

114
00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.414
Excuse me.

115
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.585
Most of it's from his hand.

116
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.092
Thumb was severed.

117
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.012
Killer may have taken it
as a trophy.

118
00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:09.181
He was alive
when it was cut off.

119
00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:13.018
Ecchymosis

120
00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:14.687
around the wound.

121
00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.287
Security detail downstairs

122
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.914
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

123
00:14:35.332 --> 00:14:37.626
The mayor was up here alone.

124
00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:42.756
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

125
00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:50.806
You said
there was a card.

126
00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:52.558
Yeah.

127
00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:05.738
"From your
secret friend. Whoo?

128
00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.616
Haven't a clue?

129
00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:11.994
Let's play a game,
just me and you.

130
00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.788
What does a liar do
when he's dead?"

131
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.208
There's a cipher too.

132
00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:26.842
Any of this
mean anything to you?

133
00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:30.596
What's going on here?

134
00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:34.975
I asked him to come, Pete.

135
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.852
This is a crime scene.

136
00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.188
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

137
00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.148
I got the press downstairs.

138
00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:43.067
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack, Jim,

139
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.109
'cause we got history.

140
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.070
But this is way over the line.

141
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.075
Wait.

142
00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:52.618
-He's involved in this?
-No, he's not involved.

143
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:53.994
How do you know?

144
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.830
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

145
00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:58.540
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

146
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.417
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

147
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:02.086
He lies still.

148
00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:04.588
Excuse me?

149
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.549
The riddle.

150
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.927
What does a liar do
when he's dead?

151
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.220
He lies still.

152
00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:21.814
Oh, Jesus.

153
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.861
This must be your favorite
night of the year, huh, pal?

154
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.240
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

155
00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.951
Excuse me,
Commissioner.

156
00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:35.869
They're ready
for your statement.

157
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.625
I want him outta here.

158
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.335
Now!

159
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:51.135
Come on.

160
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.107
Yeah.

161
00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:07.776
The kid found him.

162
00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:13.782
Was there anyone else

163
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.784
in the house when you arrived?

164
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.386
We really gotta go, man.

165
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:44.062
Tonight,
a son lost a father.

166
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.064
A wife lost a husband.

167
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.485
And I lost a friend.

168
00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:52.112
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter
for the city,

169
00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:55.657
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

170
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.660
This was
a truly senseless crime,

171
00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.037
and we are actively pursuing

172
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.122
every investigative lead
we have

173
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:04.875
in order to identify
the perpetrator

174
00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.335
and hunt him down.

175
00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:08.003
I've spoken to the governor...

176
00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:10.631
I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

177
00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.257
but I don't know.

178
00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:20.974
Murder, robberies, assault.

179
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.936
Two years later,
they're all up.

180
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.395
And now this.

181
00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.149
The city's eating itself.

182
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.111
Maybe it's beyond saving.

183
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.491
But I have to try.

184
00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.660
Push myself.

185
00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:28.417
These nights
all roll together in a rush,

186
00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.295
behind the mask.

187
00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:38.093
Sometimes in the morning,

188
00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.014
I have to force myself
to remember

189
00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.976
everything that happened.

190
00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.241
Unbelievable breaking news

191
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.868
this hour, everyone.

192
00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:05.829
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

193
00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:08.749
was found murdered last night
inside his home

194
00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.626
in the exclusive
Crest Hill district.

195
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.669
Exact details of the crime

196
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:14.171
still have not been released,

197
00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:16.924
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

198
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:20.260
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.

199
00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.387
And this certainly
is not the first time

200
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:23.764
Gotham has been rocked

201
00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:25.223
by the murder
of a political figure.

202
00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.100
In fact,
in an eerie coincidence,

203
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.227
it was 20 years ago this week

204
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.896
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

205
00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:32.940
Dr. Thomas Wayne
and his wife Martha

206
00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:36.026
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

207
00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:37.402
It was a shocking crime

208
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:39.821
that remains unsolved
to this day.

209
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.740
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s
political career

210
00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:44.576
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

211
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.911
when he and city police

212
00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:47.913
launched a major
sting operation

213
00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:49.539
resulting in the arrest

214
00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.959
of notorious mafia crime
figure Salvatore Maroni,

215
00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:53.543
with what, to this day,

216
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.213
remains the biggest drug bust
in GCPD history.

217
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:57.589
I assume you heard about this.

218
00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:00.926
-Yeah.

219
00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:09.726
Oh, I see.

220
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.979
All this
blood is from his head?

221
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:13.730
Dear God.

222
00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:24.533
There's a cipher too.

223
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.460
Any of this
mean anything to you?

224
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:39.798
The killer left this
for the Batman?

225
00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:42.843
I asked him to come, Pete.

226
00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:44.052
Apparently.

227
00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:46.138
You're becoming
quite a celebrity.

228
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.349
Why is he writing to you?

229
00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:50.976
It's Mitchell,
for chrissakes!

230
00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:52.310
I don't know yet.

231
00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:53.729
I got the press
downstairs.

232
00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.024
Have a shower.

233
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.027
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

234
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.194
are coming for breakfast.

235
00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:02.988
Here? Why?

236
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:04.740
Because I couldn't get you
to go there.

237
00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.242
-I haven't got time for this.
-It's getting serious, Bruce.

238
00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:08.577
If this continues,

239
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.412
it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

240
00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:12.164
I don't care about that.

241
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.124
Any of that.

242
00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:15.542
You don't care
about your family's legacy?

243
00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:21.089
What I'm doing
is my family's legacy.

244
00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.759
If I can't change things here,

245
00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.720
if I can't have an effect,

246
00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:28.597
then I don't care
what happens to me.

247
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.806
That's what I'm afraid of.

248
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.433
Alfred, stop.

249
00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:34.311
You're not my father.

250
00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:38.523
I'm well aware.

251
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:15.060
We really gotta go, man.

252
00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:42.462
Some fresh berries there.

253
00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.762
What are you doing?

254
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:55.016
Just reminiscing about my days
in the Circus.

255
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.104
This is
actually quite elusive.

256
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.608
Where'd you get those O's?

257
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.946
"He lies still"
is only a partial key.

258
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:10.365
It only gives us
H, E, L, I, S, and T.

259
00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:13.618
So, I'm looking for
any double symbols to start,

260
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:14.786
trying letters,

261
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.204
see where it leads.

262
00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:19.082
That's interesting.

263
00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.751
Mr. Pennyworth?

264
00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:23.003
Yes, Dory?

265
00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:24.546
The accountants are here.

266
00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.548
See them in, please, Dory.

267
00:24:29.217 --> 00:24:31.720
What if
it's not a partial key?

268
00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:33.263
What do you mean?

269
00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:35.849
What if this is the whole key?

270
00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:38.518
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

271
00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:40.145
Use only the letters
from "He lies still"

272
00:24:40.228 --> 00:24:41.897
-and leave the rest...
-Blank. Yeah, I understand.

273
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.232
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

274
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.067
I don't see
how that's gonna...

275
00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:49.738
Oh.

276
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:04.920
Damn.

277
00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:08.256
Yeah, he's got a car.

278
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.800
Guess it's good
to be the mayor.

279
00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:12.802
Where to even start?

280
00:25:12.886 --> 00:25:15.764
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

281
00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.432
You don't trust me?

282
00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:19.184
You mean like you trust me?

283
00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:20.477
It's been two years now,

284
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.229
and I don't even know
who you are, man.

285
00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:25.232
There.

286
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.215
What are we looking for?

287
00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:51.883
A USB port.

288
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:53.051
USB?

289
00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:01.351
What?

290
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.984
"Thumb" drive.

291
00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.403
Jesus.

292
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.533
It's encrypted.

293
00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:21.246
Try this.

294
00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:30.588
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

295
00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:42.309
Oh, well, well, well.

296
00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:44.769
So much for family values.

297
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:46.146
Who is she?

298
00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:48.356
No idea.

299
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.526
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

300
00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:53.653
-I know who he is.

301
00:26:53.737 --> 00:26:54.779
What was that?

302
00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:59.868
Shit, shit, shit! The drive.

303
00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:02.329
It sent out the photos
from my account.

304
00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:05.206
Gotham Post, Gazette,
GC-1, all of them.

305
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.000
Jesus.

306
00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:09.711
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

307
00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:11.296
"He lies still."

308
00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:12.464
About her?

309
00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:15.300
Maybe.

310
00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.177
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

311
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.680
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

312
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:23.058
Never get in there
without a warrant.

313
00:27:25.393 --> 00:27:26.478
Yeah.

314
00:27:39.532 --> 00:27:40.784
Know who I am?

315
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:44.662
Yeah. I got an idea.

316
00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:46.706
I want to see the Penguin.

317
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.209
I don't know what
you're talking about, pal.

318
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.632
What's the problem?

319
00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:57.008
Says he wants
to see the Penguin.

320
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:59.135
Penguin?
There's no Penguin here.

321
00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:00.845
That's what
I tried to tell him.

322
00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:03.139
Get out of here, freak.
You hear me?

323
00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:05.350
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

324
00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:07.811
Mine or yours?

325
00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:17.028
Get him!

326
00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.279
I saw that whole thing.

327
00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:19.531
He's over there!

328
00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:21.074
What is your problem?

329
00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:25.453
Yo!

330
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.869
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

331
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:17.797
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

332
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:20.008
Take it easy, sweetheart.

333
00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:22.510
You looking for me?

334
00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:25.180
I see you met the twins.

335
00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.850
Boy, you're everything
they say, ain't ya?

336
00:29:29.642 --> 00:29:31.227
I guess we both are.

337
00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:35.190
How you doing?

338
00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:37.609
I'm Oz.

339
00:29:42.238 --> 00:29:43.448
Who is she?

340
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.912
I really don't know, chief.

341
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:52.040
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

342
00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.291
but I wasn't rolling
with them.

343
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:07.931
It's okay, baby.

344
00:30:08.014 --> 00:30:11.976
Mr. Vengeance here,
he don't bite. Come on.

345
00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:39.546
Thank you, honey.

346
00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:47.136
Here you go, champ.

347
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.055
I wanna know who she is,

348
00:30:49.138 --> 00:30:50.848
and what she has to do
with this murder.

349
00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:53.101
-Whose murder?
-The mayor's.

350
00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:54.477
Is that the mayor?

351
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:56.479
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

352
00:30:57.605 --> 00:30:58.940
Don't make me hurt you.

353
00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:03.152
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

354
00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:06.281
Yeah, I do. Do you?

355
00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.534
Look...

356
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:14.247
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

357
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.583
I mean, what people do here

358
00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:18.710
ain't got nothing to do
with me.

359
00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:28.595
Tell you one thing.

360
00:31:30.597 --> 00:31:34.642
Whoever she is,
she's one hot chick.

361
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.227
Why don't you ask
Mitchell's wife?

362
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:37.353
Maybe she knows.

363
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.400
What? Too soon?

364
00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:55.413
You let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

365
00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:04.922
Taxi!

366
00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.426
Taxi!

367
00:32:27.153 --> 00:32:28.071
Hey, it's me.

368
00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:31.240
Baby, what's wrong?

369
00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:33.785
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down,
slow down. I can't...

370
00:32:36.204 --> 00:32:38.039
On the news?

371
00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:41.459
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

372
00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:43.127
Wait for me,
I'm on my way home.

373
00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:45.880
Listen, baby,

374
00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:48.549
we're gonna get the hell
out of here, okay? I promise.

375
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:52.095
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

376
00:32:52.178 --> 00:32:53.388
-Uh...

377
00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:57.141
God damn it.

378
00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.079
...photos
of murdered mayor,

379
00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:20.915
Don Mitchell, Jr.
with a younger mystery woman.

380
00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.417
In a shocking development,

381
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.918
the police believe
the photos themselves...

382
00:33:57.201 --> 00:34:00.329
Now they urge her
to contact the GCPD...

383
00:36:14.797 --> 00:36:16.257
You're pretty good at that.

384
00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:49.749
Hey! Give me that.

385
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.796
"Kosolov, Annika."

386
00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:59.300
He hurt her?
That's why you killed him?

387
00:36:59.383 --> 00:37:02.178
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

388
00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:43.052
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

389
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:45.554
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

390
00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:47.098
She's trying to get
the hell out of here,

391
00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:49.100
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

392
00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:50.476
What does she know?

393
00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:51.602
Whatever it is,
it's got her so spooked

394
00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:52.770
she won't even tell me.

395
00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:54.397
She did seem upset.

396
00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.692
Back at your place.

397
00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:01.237
Let's go talk to her.

398
00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:28.472
Anni!

399
00:38:29.765 --> 00:38:30.850
Baby!

400
00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:33.519
Anni!

401
00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:39.275
Anni!

402
00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:42.570
It's gonna
be cool this evening.

403
00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:45.197
It's gonna be down
into the 40s.

404
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:47.033
More
breaking news this hour,

405
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:50.786
as the city is rocked by
a second high-profile murder

406
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.288
in as many nights.

407
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:53.581
And this time, the killer
has come forward

408
00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:54.790
to claim credit online...

409
00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:56.250
Jesus, what are they
gonna do to her?

410
00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.626
She's just a kid.

411
00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.422
-Shit, they took my phone.
-His victim,

412
00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:02.590
longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,

413
00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:04.091
Commissioner Pete Savage,

414
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.177
was found dead
earlier tonight

415
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.179
inside the Police
Athletic League facilities

416
00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:09.680
in the Tricorner area.

417
00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:11.974
The killer posted
the following message

418
00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:13.684
on social media,

419
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.895
and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.

420
00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:23.778
Hello, people of Gotham.

421
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.946
This is the Riddler speaking.

422
00:39:27.364 --> 00:39:28.991
On Halloween night,

423
00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.451
I killed your mayor

424
00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:34.038
because he was not
who he pretended to be.

425
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:36.791
But I am not done.

426
00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:41.337
Here is another...

427
00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:48.469
...who will soon
be losing face.

428
00:39:50.012 --> 00:39:54.141
I will kill again,
and again, and again

429
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.893
until our day of judgment

430
00:39:55.976 --> 00:40:01.816
when the truth about our city
will finally

431
00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:04.026
be unmasked.

432
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.238
Goodbye!

433
00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:12.827 line:5%

Commissioner Savage served

434
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.329 line:5%
a distinguished 30-year career
on the GCPD...

435
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.748
Holy shit,
I seen that guy, too.

436
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:20.417
At the club.

437
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:23.170
The Iceberg Lounge?

438
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.381
44 Below.

439
00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.300
What is that?

440
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.097
The club within the club.

441
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:36.100
The real club.

442
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.437
It's a mob hangout.

443
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:41.981
Is that where you work?

444
00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:45.359
Selina?

445
00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:52.658
No, I just work
the bar upstairs.

446
00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:57.663
But I see 'em come in.

447
00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:59.206
Who?

448
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.374
A lot of guys
that shouldn't be there,

449
00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:01.834
I can tell you that.

450
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.255
Your basic
upstanding citizen types.

451
00:41:08.424 --> 00:41:10.050
You're gonna help me on this.

452
00:41:10.718 --> 00:41:12.219
For your friend.

453
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.148
You got a lot of cats.

454
00:41:25.524 --> 00:41:27.568
I have a thing about strays.

455
00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.032
You're not safe here.

456
00:41:34.074 --> 00:41:35.117
I can take care of myself.

457
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:36.577
Two public figures

458
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.078
now dead in just
the last two nights,

459
00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.747
and only days
before the election.

460
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.081
Police and city officials

461
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.958
are left searching
for a killer

462
00:41:43.042 --> 00:41:46.212
and hoping to find him
before he kills again.

463
00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:08.108
He waited for him at the gym.

464
00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.319
Pete always liked
to work out late at night,

465
00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:13.489
when no one else was around.

466
00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:15.074
There's a needle mark
on his neck.

467
00:42:15.157 --> 00:42:17.201
Injected him with arsenic.

468
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:20.538
Rat poison.

469
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:22.873
Yeah.

470
00:42:22.957 --> 00:42:25.960
That seems to be
his theme here.

471
00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.336
Look at this thing.

472
00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:37.179
It's a maze.

473
00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.433
What kind of demented
son of a bitch

474
00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:43.185
does this to a person?

475
00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.022
More symbols.

476
00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:50.859
It's another cipher.

477
00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:54.321
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

478
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:57.032
Bastard murders you
and your reputation.

479
00:42:57.116 --> 00:43:00.411
That guy pushes drops.
On the east end.

480
00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.372
I don't get it.

481
00:43:03.455 --> 00:43:05.791
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

482
00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:08.627
Looks like he got greedy.

483
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:10.045
You kidding me?

484
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:12.464
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

485
00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:13.924
We busted
their entire operation,

486
00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:15.926
then he caves
to some lowlife dealer?

487
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.220
Maybe he's not
who you thought.

488
00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:21.807
You make it sound
like he had it coming.

489
00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:25.519
He was a cop.

490
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.147
Crossed a line.

491
00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.804
"I'm mad about you.

492
00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:04.767
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

493
00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:14.818
"Follow the maze
until you find the rat.

494
00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:18.697
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

495
00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:20.991
The hell is that?

496
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:24.453
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

497
00:44:25.537 --> 00:44:27.081
I don't know.

498
00:44:27.873 --> 00:44:29.083
Lieutenant.

499
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:30.459
They're coming back.

500
00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.127
We got
to get out of here.

501
00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:37.508
Come on.

502
00:44:42.638 --> 00:44:43.680
Ow.

503
00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:46.433
I don't know
about these things.

504
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:49.978
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

505
00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:56.652
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

506
00:44:58.445 --> 00:44:59.988
I'm just looking for Annika.

507
00:45:04.159 --> 00:45:06.745
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

508
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:08.205
You really don't care
what happens to me

509
00:45:08.288 --> 00:45:09.540
in there tonight, do you?

510
00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:20.384
Look at me.

511
00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:32.187
Looks good. Here.

512
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.316
I got you. Can you hear me?

513
00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:19.276
Yeah.

514
00:46:27.826 --> 00:46:29.411
Hey, where you goin'?

515
00:46:29.495 --> 00:46:31.205
Hospitality.

516
00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:32.623
That's one of the guys

517
00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:34.249
I got into it with
the other night.

518
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:37.419
Looks like I broke his nose.

519
00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:46.220
"Kenzie, William."

520
00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:47.846
He's an off-duty cop.

521
00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.558
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

522
00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.769
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

523
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.539
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

524
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:14.623
Great.

525
00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:22.923
These guys
have a little problem

526
00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.216
with eye contact, don't they?

527
00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:25.717
Feels good, doesn't it?

528
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:28.136
Yeah, baby.
Feels real good.

529
00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.769
Jesus,
I hate dropheads.

530
00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:36.812
Really?

531
00:47:36.895 --> 00:47:38.272
'Cause when I first saw you,

532
00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:39.773
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

533
00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:40.649
You don't know
what you're talking about.

534
00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:42.025
Can we not...

535
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.986
Can we not do this right now?

536
00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.531
Wait. Who was that?

537
00:47:47.614 --> 00:47:48.574
Oh, I saw him.

538
00:47:48.657 --> 00:47:50.117
Look back.

539
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.743
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

540
00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:53.120
I need to see his face.

541
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.248
Jesus.

542
00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.382
That's the DA.

543
00:48:05.465 --> 00:48:06.550
Gil Colson.

544
00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:08.302
And he's coming over.
You happy?

545
00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:09.595
Talk to him.

546
00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:13.765
Hey. How you doing?

547
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:15.892
-Hi.
-I'm Gil.

548
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:19.688
-Hey, aren't you the DA?
-Yeah.

549
00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:22.107
Wow.
I've seen you on TV.

550
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:23.775
Is that right?

551
00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:26.987
I haven't seen you
around here before.

552
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.114
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl

553
00:48:29.197 --> 00:48:31.658
'cause people
are all a little on edge.

554
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.243
Oh, honey,
I live on the edge.

555
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:34.703
-Is that right?

556
00:48:34.786 --> 00:48:36.246
I like that.

557
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.581
Do you want to come over?

558
00:48:37.664 --> 00:48:38.665
Sure.

559
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.003
-This is Travis.
-Hey.

560
00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:44.546
You wanna take a seat
over there?

561
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.673
-Richie, Glen.
-Hey.

562
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.509
That's half the DA's office.

563
00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:50.844
You know Carla here, huh?

564
00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:52.638
-Hi.
-That's Cheri. Don't mind her,

565
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:54.014
she's just taking a break.

566
00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.183
Drowning our sorrows.

567
00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.601
You want a drop?

568
00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.686
Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

569
00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:03.148
Hope you don't mind.

570
00:49:03.231 --> 00:49:04.483
I got a lot on my shoulders

571
00:49:04.566 --> 00:49:05.859
with that psycho
running around.

572
00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:06.943
He's wasted.

573
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:08.528
No shit.

574
00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:11.031
I like this girl.

575
00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:12.741
Oh, hey, I like you, too!

576
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:17.871
I mean, this Riddler,

577
00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:19.539
he's going after the most
powerful people in the city.

578
00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:20.874
He knows so much.

579
00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.250
He doesn't
know shit, man.

580
00:49:22.334 --> 00:49:23.627
What are you
talking about?

581
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.045
Yeah, he does!
What about that rat...

582
00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:26.672
Hey, hey,
Gil, come on.

583
00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:28.340
-Hey. The rat.
-Think maybe you had

584
00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:29.549
-a little too much. Slow down.
-Ask him about the rat.

585
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:33.387
Hey,
what's this about a rat?

586
00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:45.482
I mean,

587
00:49:45.565 --> 00:49:49.611
there was a rat.
We had an informant.

588
00:49:49.695 --> 00:49:52.114
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

589
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:53.949
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

590
00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:55.575
He's talking about
the Maroni case.

591
00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:59.496
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

592
00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:00.914
And when it does,

593
00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:02.040
this whole city's
gonna come apart.

594
00:50:02.124 --> 00:50:03.917
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

595
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.419
This is
the kind of pillow talk

596
00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:06.753
that got that Russian girl
disappeared.

597
00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:09.381
What do you know about that?

598
00:50:09.464 --> 00:50:11.967
-Does anybody want a drink?
-I want a drink.

599
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.343
Keep him talking.

600
00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:18.598
-Wait, where are you going?
-She knows Annika.

601
00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:19.975
No, stay on the DA.

602
00:50:20.058 --> 00:50:22.144
I told you
I'm looking for my friend.

603
00:50:24.062 --> 00:50:25.105
Where's Annika?

604
00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.523
Out of my face.
I don't know you.

605
00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:27.816
Yeah, but you know her.
Who took her?

606
00:50:27.899 --> 00:50:29.317
What have you heard?
Is she okay?

607
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.527
Jesus Christ,
keep your voice down.

608
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:31.903
What, you got a death wish?

609
00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.822
Hey,
what's the problem, ladies?

610
00:50:33.905 --> 00:50:36.783
There's no problem.
It's just girl talk.

611
00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.452
Let's keep it festive
down here, all right?

612
00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:39.745
Sure thing, Oz.

613
00:50:44.499 --> 00:50:45.542
Hey.

614
00:50:46.126 --> 00:50:48.128
Hey.

615
00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:51.548
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

616
00:50:52.799 --> 00:50:54.050
How you been?

617
00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:58.096
Yeah, I've been okay.

618
00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:00.807
I was just, um...

619
00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.644
I was just headed back
upstairs.

620
00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.438
Mm. Well,

621
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.191
don't be a stranger.

622
00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:25.415
-You know Carmine Falcone.
-I told you it's a mob spot.

623
00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:27.000
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

624
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.002
I don't have a relationship
with him, okay?

625
00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.504
Well, that's not
what it looked like.

626
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.255
-Forget it.
-Wait, what are you doing?

627
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:33.507
Listen,
I can't do this anymore.

628
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:34.674
No! No!

629
00:51:39.304 --> 00:51:40.305
Taxi!

630
00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:45.310
Hey!

631
00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:48.063
I lost you in there.

632
00:51:48.146 --> 00:51:49.272
Yeah, I gotta go.

633
00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:52.108
Oh, you need a ride?

634
00:51:52.192 --> 00:51:53.485
That's me right there.

635
00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:00.700
Taxi!

636
00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:01.910
I'm good.

637
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:05.288
I hope, uh...

638
00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:11.461
-I'll see you around.

639
00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:41.343
Just hold still.

640
00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:41.736
What do you know
about a confidential informant

641
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.196
in the Maroni case?

642
00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:48.785
Yeah, sure, there was.

643
00:54:48.868 --> 00:54:51.538
That's the rat
we're looking for.

644
00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.957
Somehow
Riddler knows who he is.

645
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.210
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

646
00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:58.753
Where are you getting this?

647
00:54:58.837 --> 00:55:01.715
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

648
00:55:02.507 --> 00:55:04.634
Gil's very nervous.

649
00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:07.429
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

650
00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:09.305
I worked that case.

651
00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:12.726
-Riddler's not after you.
-How do you know?

652
00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.310
You're not corrupt.

653
00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:16.896
Colson's dirty?

654
00:55:22.736 --> 00:55:24.654
Maybe I, uh...

655
00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:28.158
I go after him. Lean on him
to give up the rat.

656
00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:29.534
It's too dangerous.

657
00:55:29.617 --> 00:55:32.120
They made a secret deal
with this guy.

658
00:55:32.203 --> 00:55:34.080
Who knows how many people
it touches.

659
00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:38.501
Politicians. Police.
The courts.

660
00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:40.587
It could tear
the whole city apart.

661
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.922
Jesus,
this is a powder keg.

662
00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:46.885
And Riddler's the match.

663
00:55:46.968 --> 00:55:48.428
You know Carmine Falcone.

664
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.305
I told you
it's a mob spot.

665
00:55:50.388 --> 00:55:51.973
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

666
00:55:52.057 --> 00:55:52.932
I don't have
a relationship...

667
00:55:54.768 --> 00:55:56.436
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

668
00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:57.604
I don't have
a relationship with him.

669
00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:58.897
-Okay?

670
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.398
You know
Carmine Falcone.

671
00:56:00.482 --> 00:56:02.275
I told you
it's a mob spot.

672
00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:04.194
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

673
00:56:04.277 --> 00:56:05.612
{\an5}I don't have
a relationship
with him. Okay?

674
00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:06.654
-Pretty.

675
00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:09.866
She a new friend of yours?

676
00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:15.663
I'm not so sure.

677
00:56:15.747 --> 00:56:18.291
Looks like you upset her.

678
00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.668
Shall I take this
as a good sign?

679
00:56:20.752 --> 00:56:22.629
-What?
-Your attire.

680
00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:24.714
Is Bruce Wayne
making an actual appearance?

681
00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:26.758
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

682
00:56:26.841 --> 00:56:30.595
Serial killers like to follow
reactions to their crimes.

683
00:56:30.678 --> 00:56:32.305
Riddler might not
be able to resist.

684
00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.808
Oh, that reminds me.

685
00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:37.602
I've taken the liberty
of doing a little work

686
00:56:37.685 --> 00:56:39.437
on this latest cipher.

687
00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:41.272
The one from the rat maze.

688
00:56:41.356 --> 00:56:44.651
I'm afraid his Spanish
is not perfect,

689
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.694
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

690
00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:50.573
"You are El Rata Alada."

691
00:56:50.657 --> 00:56:52.242
Rata Alada?

692
00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:53.368
"Rat with wings"?

693
00:56:53.451 --> 00:56:54.577
It's slang for "pigeon."

694
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:56.162
Does that mean anything
to you?

695
00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:57.372
Yeah.

696
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.166
A stool pigeon.

697
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.877
-Where are your cufflinks?
-I couldn't find them.

698
00:57:04.212 --> 00:57:06.131
Well, you can't
go out like that.

699
00:57:06.214 --> 00:57:08.174
Alfred, I don't want
your cufflinks.

700
00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:14.180
You have to keep up
appearances.

701
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:16.599
-You're still a Wayne.

702
00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:19.060
And what about you?
Are you a Wayne?

703
00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:21.855
Your father gave them to me.

704
00:57:27.402 --> 00:57:31.447
No more lies! No more lies!

705
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:34.742
No more lies! No more lies!

706
00:57:34.826 --> 00:57:38.204
No more lies! No more lies!

707
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:41.749
No more lies! No more lies!

708
00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:44.919
No more lies! No more lies!

709
00:57:45.003 --> 00:57:48.715
No more lies! No more lies!

710
00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:50.133
Mr. Wayne. All right.

711
00:57:50.216 --> 00:57:52.510
All right, you're going
straight down there.

712
00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:05.940
Is that Bruce Wayne?

713
00:58:06.024 --> 00:58:08.610
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

714
00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:18.912
Hold it.

715
00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:21.497
You good, fellas?

716
00:58:22.081 --> 00:58:23.082
Good.

717
00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:26.294
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

718
00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:45.104
Sir?

719
00:59:04.582 --> 00:59:05.792
Hey!

720
00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.794
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

721
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.797
Hey, watch it, fellas.

722
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.341
You got the prince
of the city there.

723
00:59:16.427 --> 00:59:18.137
Some event, huh?

724
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:20.014
Brought out the one guy
in the city

725
00:59:20.098 --> 00:59:21.307
more reclusive than me.

726
00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.768
Thought you'd never leave
the Shoreline.

727
00:59:23.851 --> 00:59:25.436
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

728
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.689
Why? 'Cause your father
ain't around?

729
00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:30.441
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

730
00:59:30.525 --> 00:59:32.151
Wow, is that right?

731
00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:34.904
His father saved my life.

732
00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:38.324
I got shot in the chest.
Right here.

733
00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:40.743
I couldn't go to no hospital,

734
00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:43.079
so we showed up
on his doorstep.

735
00:59:43.162 --> 00:59:46.374
Operated right
on the dining room table.

736
00:59:46.457 --> 00:59:49.669
Kid here,
he saw the whole thing,

737
00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.879
up on the stairs looking down.

738
00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:55.300
I remember your face.

739
00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:59.387
You don't think that meant
something, he did that?

740
00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:01.764
It meant he took
the Hippocratic oath.

741
01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.684
"Hippocratic oath."

742
01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:08.855
That's good.

743
01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.148
Excuse me.

744
01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:14.610
Yes.

745
01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:30.209
Ladies and gentlemen,

746
01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.794
thank you all for coming
to today's memorial

747
01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.713
for our beloved mayor,
Don Mitchell, Jr.

748
01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.673
Our program
will begin shortly.

749
01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.383
As a reminder,
the family asked

750
01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.885
that those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory

751
01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.553
consider a donation
to the cause

752
01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.430
-most dear to his heart...

753
01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:44.599
...the Gotham Renewal Fund,

754
01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:46.142
our city's safety net.

755
01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:49.771
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

756
01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:52.398
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it,

757
01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.775
I can tell you that.

758
01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:57.111
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

759
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.989
He got what he deserved.

760
01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:02.867
Know what I mean?

761
01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.245
Hey, don't I know you?

762
01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.122
Bruce Wayne.

763
01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:10.291
Why haven't
you called me back?

764
01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.584
I'm sorry?

765
01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.961
I'm Bella Real.
I'm running for mayor.

766
01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:15.588
I wouldn't be bothering
you here,

767
01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:18.007
but your people keep
telling me you're unavailable.

768
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.509
Will you walk with me?

769
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.973
Mr. Wayne.

770
01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:27.683
Mr. Wayne.

771
01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:31.437
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

772
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.189
Your family
has a history of philanthropy,

773
01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.858
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

774
01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:39.028
If I'm elected,
I want to change that.

775
01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.446
Thank you.

776
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.323
My God.

777
01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:46.536
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

778
01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:48.246
I want to continue this.

779
01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.418
Excuse me.

780
01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.338
I'm so sorry for your loss.

781
01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:00.716
Thank you.

782
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.301
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

783
01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.471
Gil Colson is missing.

784
01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.722
What?

785
01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.183
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

786
01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:10.309
Christ, not again.

787
01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.562
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

788
01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:17.275
You got people
looking for him, Jim?

789
01:02:17.358 --> 01:02:19.652
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

790
01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:20.987
What'd his wife say?

791
01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.155
She hadn't
heard from him.

792
01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.461
Get out of the car!

793
01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:20.922
Get out of the car
and show your hands!

794
01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:23.674
Get out!

795
01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:35.061
Get 'em up!

796
01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.979
Get out! Show 'em!

797
01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.902
Christ, it's Colson.

798
01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.529
There's a bomb
around his neck!

799
01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.504
Let's clear
this place out now!

800
01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:03.214
We've got to get
this place cleared out!

801
01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.126
Hey, guys, guys.
Here we go.

802
01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.839
We don't know
if he's in on it.

803
01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.176
What's he looking at?

804
01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.197
Holy shit.

805
01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:11.907
Are you kidding me?

806
01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.494
What the hell is he doing?
Gordon!

807
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.205
Your guy's gonna get himself
killed in there.

808
01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:35.097
Please.

809
01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:38.351
He made me do it.
I'm so sorry.

810
01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.644
He told me if I didn't do

811
01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:40.686
exactly what he said,
he'd kill me.

812
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.063
I'm so sorry.

813
01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:43.856
Looks like a combination lock.

814
01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:45.983
Can't we just cut it off?

815
01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.902
Not if you want
to keep your head.

816
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.815
You came.

817
01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:29.193
Who are you?

818
01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:30.277
Me?

819
01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.281
I'm nobody.

820
01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.077
I'm just an instrument,

821
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.870
here to unmask the truth

822
01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.540
about this cesspool
we call a city.

823
01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:44.125
"Unmask"?

824
01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:46.043
Yes.

825
01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:49.004
Let's do it together, okay?

826
01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:52.091
I've been trying to reach you.

827
01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:54.635
You're part of this, too.

828
01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.554
How am I a part of this?

829
01:06:56.637 --> 01:06:58.264
You'll see.

830
01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.099
Hey, Chief. You
better take a look at this.

831
01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:02.435
Say hello to my followers.

832
01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:03.894 line:5%
We're live.

833
01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.689 line:5%
They're here to watch
our little trial.

834
01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.150 line:5%
At the moment,

835
01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:12.695 line:5%
the man across
from you, Mr. Colson,

836
01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:13.946 line:5%
is dead.

837
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:15.656
Jesus, can we
get somebody out here?

838
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.991
-This psycho's gonna kill me!
-But wait a minute...

839
01:07:17.074 --> 01:07:18.451
Shut up!

840
01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.119
You deserve to be dead
after what you did!

841
01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:23.205
You hear me?

842
01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.915
Okay.

843
01:07:32.923 --> 01:07:35.176
I'm giving you a chance.

844
01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:39.096
No one ever gave me a chance.

845
01:07:41.098 --> 01:07:42.975
Now,

846
01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:45.770
ever since I was a child,

847
01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:49.982
I've always loved
little puzzles.

848
01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:52.485
For me, they are a retreat

849
01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:55.946
from the horrors of our world.

850
01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:58.199
Maybe they can bring

851
01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:01.118
some comfort to you too,
Mr. Colson.

852
01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:03.537
-You want me to do puzzles?

853
01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:06.373
Three riddles in two minutes.

854
01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:08.083
You give me the answers,

855
01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.503
and I'll give you
the code for the lock.

856
01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.005
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

857
01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:15.174
Okay, okay. So I just...

858
01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:16.801
-You want me to...

859
01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:18.719
-Riddle number one...

860
01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:20.554
-"It can be cruel,

861
01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.431
poetic, or blind,

862
01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:27.269
"but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

863
01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.855
Wait, wait, wait!
Can you repeat that?

864
01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:30.981
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

865
01:08:31.065 --> 01:08:32.483
-"Justice."
-Huh?

866
01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:33.651
The answer's "justice."

867
01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.027
-Justice?
-Yes!

868
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:36.487
-Oh, God.
-Justice!

869
01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:39.198
And you were supposed to be

870
01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.950
an arm of justice
in this city,

871
01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.536
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

872
01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.913
were you not, Mr. Colson?

873
01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:47.331
Of course, of course.

874
01:08:47.414 --> 01:08:49.542
- Of course.
-Riddle number two.

875
01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:53.754
"If you are justice,
please do not lie.

876
01:08:53.838 --> 01:08:58.050
"What is the price
for your blind eye?"

877
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.052
-"The price"?
-"Bribes."

878
01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:01.303
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

879
01:09:01.387 --> 01:09:02.513
He's asking you
how much it cost

880
01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:03.639
for you to turn your back.

881
01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.141
Fifty-eight seconds!

882
01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.685
-How much?
-Nothing!

883
01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:09.812
-How much?
-Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

884
01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.105
I get a monthly payment

885
01:09:11.188 --> 01:09:12.481
just not to prosecute
certain cases.

886
01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:13.899
-What cases?
-He didn't ask me that!

887
01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.609
-Come on! Ten grand.

888
01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:17.152
That's my answer.
It's ten grand!

889
01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:18.612
Okay. Okay. Okay.

890
01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:21.282
Don't lose your head,
Mr. Colson.

891
01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:25.369
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

892
01:09:25.452 --> 01:09:27.746
Last riddle.

893
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:32.084
"Since
your justice is so select,

894
01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:36.589
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

895
01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.799
-"Which vermin"?
-The rat.

896
01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.050
The informant you all protect

897
01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.468
from
the Salvatore Maroni case.

898
01:09:41.552 --> 01:09:43.304
-How do you know about that?
-What's his name?

899
01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:45.097
-Twenty seconds.
-No.

900
01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.974
-He's gonna kill you.
-I'm a dead man either way.

901
01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:48.350
You're talking
to a dead man, okay?

902
01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.102
If I go out this way,
it's just me.

903
01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:53.272
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

904
01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:54.690
-He'll kill them, too.
-Who will?

905
01:09:54.773 --> 01:09:56.275
-People are watching.
-What people?

906
01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.319
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

907
01:09:58.402 --> 01:09:59.570
It's the whole system!

908
01:09:59.653 --> 01:10:01.530 line:5%
-Five! Four!

909
01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.032 line:5%
-Oh, God, have mercy on me...
-Three!

910
01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:05.034
-Goodbye!

911
01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.024
Who do you
think he is under there?

912
01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:38.651
Take it easy.
I want to see.

913
01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.111
What is that thing?
Leather?

914
01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:46.325
What's he got
on his eyes?

915
01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:47.952
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

916
01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:49.370
-We are we doing here?
-Let's just take it off...

917
01:10:49.453 --> 01:10:50.955
-Hey!

918
01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.123
Hey! Hey! Hey!

919
01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.166
Hey! Hey!

920
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.834
Relax, God damn it!

921
01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.544
You're protecting
this guy, Jim?

922
01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.799
He interfered in an active
hostage situation.

923
01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:04.343
Colson's blood
is on his hands.

924
01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:05.803
Maybe it's on yours.

925
01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:08.180
What'd you say?

926
01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.391
He would rather die than talk.

927
01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:12.059
What was he afraid of?

928
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.103
You?

929
01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.695
You son of a bitch.

930
01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.823
You have any idea what kind
of trouble you're in?

931
01:11:25.906 --> 01:11:27.533
You could be
an accessory to murder.

932
01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.742
Why are we
playing games...

933
01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:31.870
Get him! Come on!

934
01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.747
Back off! Back off!

935
01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:36.208
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

936
01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.501
You got me
on assaulting three.

937
01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:39.086
Hey!

938
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:41.380
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

939
01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.384
You too now?

940
01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:48.053
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

941
01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.638
You're gonna put yourself
on the line

942
01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.140
for this scumbag, Jim?

943
01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:53.225
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

944
01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.479
Okay, give him the room.

945
01:12:13.078 --> 01:12:14.413
Two minutes.

946
01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.760
You listen to me.

947
01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.346
We gotta get you out of here.

948
01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:34.808
That would put
a lot of heat on you.

949
01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.727
Well, you punched me
in the face.

950
01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.230
Take this key.

951
01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.775
Through that door.

952
01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:45.652
Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

953
01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:48.447
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

954
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.824
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

955
01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:56.705
Who's the mustache
with the broken nose?

956
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.628
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

957
01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.463
He's one of the guys
I got into it with

958
01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:05.839
at the Iceberg Lounge.

959
01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:07.633
What are you saying?

960
01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:09.384
Kenzie moonlights
for the Penguin?

961
01:13:12.012 --> 01:13:14.056
Or he moonlights as a cop.

962
01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:19.978
-Jesus Christ!
-Go!

963
01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.563
Somebody stop him!

964
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.395
-There he is!
-Freeze!

965
01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:49.651
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

966
01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.278
I did.

967
01:14:51.361 --> 01:14:53.071
Bock put out an APB on you.

968
01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.740
You really think
he's in on this?

969
01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.950
I don't trust any of 'em.
Do you?

970
01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:58.577
I only trust you.

971
01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.454
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

972
01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:02.748
Colson said,
"Cops protect the rat."

973
01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.583
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

974
01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.959
You think Penguin's the rat?

975
01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:07.461
His club caters to the mob.

976
01:15:07.544 --> 01:15:09.004
Maroni
practically lived there.

977
01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:11.048
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

978
01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:12.382
DA was a regular, too.

979
01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.218
Maybe Penguin
got himself into a jam

980
01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:17.012
and working a deal
was his only way out.

981
01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:19.514
-The Rata Alada.
-The what?

982
01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:21.016
Riddler's latest.

983
01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:22.601
The cipher in the maze.

984
01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.354
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

985
01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.565
A penguin's got wings, too.

986
01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.319
Time for me to have
another conversation with him.

987
01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:34.196
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

988
01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:35.447
It's all connected.

989
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:37.449
Like it or not,
it's his game now.

990
01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:40.744
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

991
01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:44.331
Kenzie and the twins,

992
01:15:44.414 --> 01:15:45.582
coming your way.

993
01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.626
There's Penguin.

994
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.503
I wonder
what's in the bags.

995
01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.381
You want to move in?

996
01:15:54.174 --> 01:15:55.592
Let's follow.

997
01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.737
They stopped
at Waterfront Street.

998
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.698
The recycling plant.

999
01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:20.200
I'm here.

1000
01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:22.119
-How you doing?
-Yeah, good. How are you?

1001
01:16:22.202 --> 01:16:23.328
Good, good.

1002
01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:25.831
Let's get in
out of this deluge.

1003
01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:46.518
It's a drug lab. Drops.

1004
01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:47.811
This is a buy.

1005
01:16:47.894 --> 01:16:49.396
Looks like
they got Maroni's operation

1006
01:16:49.479 --> 01:16:50.897
up and running again.

1007
01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.065
Or they never
shut it down at all.

1008
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:53.692
What are you saying?

1009
01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:56.945
The biggest drug bust
in GCPD history was a fraud?

1010
01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.221
This just got complicated.

1011
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.514
What do you mean?

1012
01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.147
Hey! What happened?

1013
01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:33.482
You all right?

1014
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:45.744
Dangerous crowd
you're stealing from.

1015
01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:48.246
Jesus.

1016
01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.582
Is this how
you get your kicks, hon?

1017
01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.000
Sneaking up on girls
in the dark?

1018
01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.586
Is that why
you work in the club?

1019
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.921
It was all just a score?

1020
01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.589
You know, I would love
to sit and go over

1021
01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:59.591
every gory detail
with you, bat boy,

1022
01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:02.761
but, uh, those assholes
are coming back.

1023
01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:16.066
-Jesus!

1024
01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:44.886
Hey, Vengeance!

1025
01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:49.766
You think you can come
after my money, huh?

1026
01:19:30.515 --> 01:19:32.142
Kenzie! Get the money!

1027
01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.857
Hey! What the...

1028
01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:30.534
Whoa!

1029
01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:35.580
Come on! Come on!

1030
01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.752
This guy's crazy!

1031
01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.547
Come on! Hey!

1032
01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:33.972
Move!

1033
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.580
Get out of the way!

1034
01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:52.801
Come on!

1035
01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:02.644
Get out of the way!

1036
01:23:38.888 --> 01:23:41.891
I got you!

1037
01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:44.394
I got you!

1038
01:23:44.477 --> 01:23:46.813
Take that,
you friggin' psycho!

1039
01:23:46.896 --> 01:23:48.398
I got you!

1040
01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:07.936
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

1041
01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:10.647
-Who's the Riddler?
-Riddler? How should I know?

1042
01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.106
Let's make it
easy for you, Oz.

1043
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.566
Cops caught you
doing something.

1044
01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:15.235
They were gonna
shut you down, put you away.

1045
01:25:15.318 --> 01:25:17.195
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

1046
01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:19.405
You ratted out
Salvatore Maroni.

1047
01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:20.782
His drops operation.

1048
01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:22.200
But the cops,
the city officials,

1049
01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:23.243
the mayor, the DA,

1050
01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:24.536
they got greedy, right?

1051
01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.830
Wasn't enough,
a big career-making bust.

1052
01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:28.665
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

1053
01:25:28.748 --> 01:25:31.125
but they needed a minor league
mope like you to run it.

1054
01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.461
You don't just work
for Carmine Falcone.

1055
01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:34.629
You work for them, too.

1056
01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:35.880
What are you, crazy?

1057
01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:36.923
That why
you killed the girl?

1058
01:25:37.006 --> 01:25:38.216
I didn't kill no girl!

1059
01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.884
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

1060
01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.177
But she got too close, right?

1061
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:42.554
Found out from Mitchell

1062
01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:43.930
that you were the rat,
so you killed her.

1063
01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:45.390
But somehow
Riddler found out, too.

1064
01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:47.433
He knows so much about you.

1065
01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:50.061
-You must know about him.
-Who is he?

1066
01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:52.730
Boy, you guys are a hell
of a duet here.

1067
01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.399
Why don't you start
harmonizing?

1068
01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:57.068
There's only one problem with
your little scenario, okay?

1069
01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:58.570
I ain't no rat!

1070
01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:00.405
You got any idea what
Carmine Falcone would do to me

1071
01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:01.656
if he heard this kind of talk?

1072
01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.700
Oh, you don't wanna talk
about rats, huh?

1073
01:26:03.783 --> 01:26:04.993
Maybe we can talk about

1074
01:26:05.076 --> 01:26:06.327
what they did
to my partner's face.

1075
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:07.912
Holy God, what are you
showing me here?

1076
01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.747
-This was around his head!
-Come on!

1077
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.833
Open your eyes!

1078
01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.422
Are you El Rata Alada?

1079
01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:18.756
El Rata Alada?

1080
01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.091
Yeah,
a "rat with wings."

1081
01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.593
A stool pigeon.
That's not you?

1082
01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.136
The symbols in the maze,
right here.

1083
01:26:23.219 --> 01:26:25.847
It says you are El Rata Alada.

1084
01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.223
"You are El Rata"?
It says that?

1085
01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:28.641
Why, you got something
to tell us?

1086
01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:29.976
Yeah!

1087
01:26:30.059 --> 01:26:31.603
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

1088
01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.938
-What?
-It's "La."

1089
01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.607
"La" rata.

1090
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.775
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

1091
01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.069
Jesus! Look at you two.

1092
01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:42.655
World's greatest detectives!

1093
01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:44.032
Am I the only here
knows the difference

1094
01:26:44.115 --> 01:26:45.450
between "el" and "la"?

1095
01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:47.827
Jesus!
No habla espanol, fellas?

1096
01:26:47.911 --> 01:26:50.038
Do me a favor, shithead,
shut up!

1097
01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:52.582
You think he made a mistake?

1098
01:26:52.665 --> 01:26:53.750
He doesn't made mistakes.

1099
01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.084
A rat with wings?

1100
01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:56.628
You know what
that sounds like to me?

1101
01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:59.797
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1102
01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.966
"You are El Rata."

1103
01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:09.182
"You"...

1104
01:27:09.265 --> 01:27:10.308
"are"...

1105
01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:11.434
"El."

1106
01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:22.403
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1107
01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:23.696
-Wait.

1108
01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:29.243
Is that him?

1109
01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:31.621
-Holy shit.

1110
01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:52.684
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1111
01:28:21.879 --> 01:28:25.550
"I grew up from a seed,
tough as a weed...

1112
01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.428
But in a mansion,
in a slum...

1113
01:28:28.511 --> 01:28:31.305
I'll never know
where I come from.

1114
01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:32.807
Do you know what I am?"

1115
01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:33.891
Any idea?

1116
01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:35.435
Yeah.

1117
01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:38.104
It's an orphan.

1118
01:28:46.946 --> 01:28:48.740
A mansion in a slum.

1119
01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:51.659
He's talking about
the old orphanage.

1120
01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:52.869
The one that burned down?

1121
01:28:52.952 --> 01:28:55.288
It was part of
the Wayne estate.

1122
01:28:55.371 --> 01:28:57.582
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1123
01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:58.750
Let's go.

1124
01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:03.504
You guys realize
I'm still here, right?

1125
01:29:04.547 --> 01:29:05.923
You gonna untie me?

1126
01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.425
How the hell am I supposed
to get out of here?

1127
01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:12.346
Hey!

1128
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.267
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1129
01:29:30.114 --> 01:29:32.492
-No guns.

1130
01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:35.995
Yeah, man.
That's your thing.

1131
01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.267
What's that?

1132
01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.863
Hey! Hey!

1133
01:30:17.286 --> 01:30:19.122
Dropheads.

1134
01:30:25.878 --> 01:30:27.588
What the hell is that?

1135
01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.727
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1136
01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:43.062
Wasn't that beautiful?

1137
01:30:45.648 --> 01:30:48.067
Thank you all.
Thank you, uh...

1138
01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:49.861
Thank you for coming today.

1139
01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.197
I believe in Gotham.

1140
01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:57.201
I believe in its promise.

1141
01:30:57.285 --> 01:31:01.372
But too many have been
left behind for too long,

1142
01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:03.082
and that's why I'm here today.

1143
01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:05.960
To announce, not only
my candidacy for mayor,

1144
01:31:06.043 --> 01:31:10.047
but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.

1145
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.799
Win or lose,

1146
01:31:11.883 --> 01:31:15.011
the Wayne Foundation pledges
a one billion dollar donation

1147
01:31:15.094 --> 01:31:18.431
to start a charitable
endowment for public works.

1148
01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:20.224
I want to bypass
political gridlock,

1149
01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.560
and get money
to people and projects

1150
01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:24.729
who need it now,

1151
01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.355
like these children behind me.

1152
01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:28.024
"Sins of the father."

1153
01:31:28.107 --> 01:31:31.861
Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds

1154
01:31:31.944 --> 01:31:34.906
and renewing
Gotham's promise.

1155
01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:41.078
Shall be visited upon the son.

1156
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:46.167
Jesus. His next victim
is Bruce Wayne.

1157
01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:52.089
Hey!

1158
01:32:51.691 --> 01:32:52.984
-Hello?
-Dory!

1159
01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.277
I need to speak to Alfred!

1160
01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.237
-Oh, Mr. Wayne...
-Listen to me!

1161
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.656
Something terrible
is gonna happen!

1162
01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:01.993
I'm afraid
it already has, sir.

1163
01:33:12.336 --> 01:33:14.255
About an hour ago.

1164
01:33:15.381 --> 01:33:17.091
I'm so sorry.

1165
01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:20.469
I've been trying to reach you.

1166
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:25.224
The package
was intended for you.

1167
01:33:25.308 --> 01:33:27.685
It was a C-4 explosive
sent in a mailer.

1168
01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.228
We found this too.

1169
01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:53.377
We've sedated him.

1170
01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.838
We just have to hope
he stabilizes.

1171
01:33:55.921 --> 01:33:59.133
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1172
01:33:59.216 --> 01:34:01.093
Is there anyone else
to notify?

1173
01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:03.763
Next of kin?

1174
01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.061
No.

1175
01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.688
It's just me.

1176
01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:57.084
Selina?

1177
01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:04.675
Can you see me?

1178
01:36:07.803 --> 01:36:10.431
-Yeah, I can see you.
-I need to talk to you.

1179
01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:12.433
Where can we go?

1180
01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:32.786
Cat burglar
pulling another score?

1181
01:36:33.704 --> 01:36:34.705
What?

1182
01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:36.081
Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1183
01:36:36.165 --> 01:36:37.291
Yeah, well,
things were getting

1184
01:36:37.374 --> 01:36:39.543
a little hot for me, so...

1185
01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:41.295
How could they do that to her?

1186
01:36:41.378 --> 01:36:43.422
That piece of shit cop,
Kenzie.

1187
01:36:43.506 --> 01:36:45.299
Her body was in his car.

1188
01:36:45.382 --> 01:36:47.510
I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna make him pay.

1189
01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:49.303
-You gonna help me?
-Help you?

1190
01:36:49.386 --> 01:36:51.305
Yeah. I thought
you were "Vengeance."

1191
01:36:51.388 --> 01:36:53.057
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1192
01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.642
She didn't know any better.

1193
01:36:54.725 --> 01:36:56.101
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1194
01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:57.853
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1195
01:36:57.937 --> 01:36:59.396
It means your choices
have consequences.

1196
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.815
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1197
01:37:01.899 --> 01:37:03.108
You know,
whoever the hell you are,

1198
01:37:03.192 --> 01:37:04.735
you obviously grew up rich.

1199
01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:06.737
-Was it worth it?
-What?

1200
01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:10.241
Compromising yourself
for money?

1201
01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:14.078
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1202
01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:17.873
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1203
01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:19.416
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1204
01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.627
-Falcone owes me that money.
-He owes you?

1205
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:23.337
-Yeah, and a lot more.
-Oh, really? Why's that?

1206
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.588
You know what?
I can't even talk to you.

1207
01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.048
No! I want to know

1208
01:37:26.131 --> 01:37:27.508
why a guy like Falcone
would owe you anything.

1209
01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:29.969
Because he's my father!

1210
01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:41.897
My mother worked
at the 44 Below.

1211
01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:44.692
Just like Anni.

1212
01:37:46.652 --> 01:37:49.405
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1213
01:37:51.448 --> 01:37:52.825
To the club?

1214
01:37:53.742 --> 01:37:54.743
Yeah.

1215
01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:00.624
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1216
01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:03.127
Used to see him there.

1217
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:05.296
He scared the shit out of me.

1218
01:38:07.172 --> 01:38:08.382
And I could never understand

1219
01:38:08.465 --> 01:38:10.926
why he looked at me
the way he did.

1220
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:14.972
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1221
01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:20.769
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1222
01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.188
Strangled.

1223
01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:24.523
Never found out who.

1224
01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:26.817
Probably some creep
from the club.

1225
01:38:28.485 --> 01:38:30.613
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1226
01:38:30.696 --> 01:38:33.032
and he didn't say a thing.

1227
01:38:34.783 --> 01:38:36.660
Couldn't even look at me.

1228
01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.166
He owes me that money.

1229
01:38:43.959 --> 01:38:45.377
I'm sorry.

1230
01:38:46.462 --> 01:38:47.671
For what I said.

1231
01:38:48.964 --> 01:38:50.466
Ah, it's all right.

1232
01:38:53.802 --> 01:38:56.055
You assume the worst
in people.

1233
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.349
Which, well...

1234
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:02.728
maybe we're not
so different after all.

1235
01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:09.777
Who are you under there?

1236
01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:17.743
What are you hiding?

1237
01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:21.955
Are you just...

1238
01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.250
hideously scarred?

1239
01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:28.379
Yeah.

1240
01:39:35.552 --> 01:39:37.012
Listen to me.

1241
01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:42.351
If we don't stand up
for Annika, no one will.

1242
01:39:42.434 --> 01:39:44.561
All anyone cares about
in this place

1243
01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:47.731
are these white,
privileged assholes.

1244
01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:50.901
The mayor,
the commissioner, the DA.

1245
01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.236
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1246
01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:53.654
I mean, as far
as I'm concerned,

1247
01:39:53.737 --> 01:39:55.656
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1248
01:39:55.739 --> 01:39:57.074
I think you'd be on his side.

1249
01:39:57.157 --> 01:39:58.742
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1250
01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:00.661
What, do you live in a cave?

1251
01:40:00.744 --> 01:40:03.831
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1252
01:40:03.914 --> 01:40:08.043
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1253
01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:09.294
will you help me?

1254
01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:11.839
Please.

1255
01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:16.510
Come on, Vengeance.

1256
01:40:18.762 --> 01:40:21.098
Just don't make any moves
without me, understand?

1257
01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:22.850
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1258
01:40:32.776 --> 01:40:34.361
I told you, baby.

1259
01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:38.699
I can take care of myself.

1260
01:40:49.293 --> 01:40:52.796
I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.

1261
01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:01.972
From a very young age,

1262
01:41:02.055 --> 01:41:04.183
my family, Martha's family,
the Arkhams,

1263
01:41:04.266 --> 01:41:05.976 line:5%
instilled in both of us

1264
01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:08.896 line:5%
that giving back
is not just an obligation,

1265
01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:10.981 line:5%
it's a passion.

1266
01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:14.443 line:5%
That is our family's legacy.

1267
01:41:14.526 --> 01:41:16.987 line:5%

The Waynes and the Arkhams.

1268
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:19.490 line:5%
Gotham's founding families.

1269
01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:23.869 line:5%
But what is their real legacy?

1270
01:41:23.952 --> 01:41:26.914 line:5%
Twenty years ago,
one reporter set out

1271
01:41:26.997 --> 01:41:28.665 line:5%
to uncover the dark truth.

1272
01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:33.045 line:5%
He found
shocking family secrets.

1273
01:41:33.128 --> 01:41:35.088 line:5%
How, when Martha
was just a child,

1274
01:41:35.172 --> 01:41:37.341 line:5%
her mother
brutally murdered her father,

1275
01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:38.884 line:5%
then committed suicide...

1276
01:41:38.967 --> 01:41:40.511 line:5%
-
-...and how the Arkhams

1277
01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:44.723 line:5%
used their power and money
to cover it up.

1278
01:41:44.807 --> 01:41:46.683 line:5%
How Martha herself

1279
01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:49.520 line:5%
was in and out of institutions
for years,

1280
01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:52.523
and they didn't want
anyone to know.

1281
01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:55.067 line:5%
Thomas Wayne tried to force
this crusading reporter

1282
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:59.571 line:5%
into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.

1283
01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:01.865 line:5%
But when
the reporter refused,

1284
01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.701 line:5%
Wayne turned
to longtime secret associate

1285
01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.203 line:5%
Carmine Falcone,

1286
01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:08.747 line:5%

and had him murdered!

1287
01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:12.501
-The Waynes and the Arkhams,

1288
01:42:12.584 --> 01:42:18.215 line:5%
Gotham's legacy
of lies and murder.

1289
01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:20.717
I hope
you're listening, Bruce Wayne.

1290
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.387
This is your legacy too.

1291
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:26.849
And Gotham needs you to answer

1292
01:42:26.932 --> 01:42:29.935
for the sins of your father.

1293
01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:33.272
Goodbye.

1294
01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:39.945
Do you know who I am?

1295
01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:42.573
You're Bruce Wayne.

1296
01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:44.658
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1297
01:42:55.419 --> 01:42:56.420
See?

1298
01:43:08.056 --> 01:43:10.893
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1299
01:43:10.976 --> 01:43:13.353
Must have made a fortune.

1300
01:43:13.437 --> 01:43:16.607
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1301
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:19.276
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1302
01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:20.402
No, boss.

1303
01:43:20.485 --> 01:43:23.238
$1,183.

1304
01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:25.324
You know
why communism failed, right?

1305
01:43:25.407 --> 01:43:26.491
No, boss.

1306
01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:29.620
Austerity.

1307
01:43:31.788 --> 01:43:33.290
All right. All right.

1308
01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:36.001
Look at that. Perfect.

1309
01:43:36.084 --> 01:43:38.045
It's never gonna be
that good again.

1310
01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:42.674
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1311
01:43:42.758 --> 01:43:43.967
What are you doing here?

1312
01:43:45.761 --> 01:43:47.721
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1313
01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:49.681
Come on.

1314
01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:52.809
See ya, champ.

1315
01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.062
Come on, sweetheart.

1316
01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:58.023
Have a seat.

1317
01:43:59.942 --> 01:44:02.778
I thought
I might hear from you.

1318
01:44:02.861 --> 01:44:06.156
This, uh, Riddler
son of a bitch is really

1319
01:44:07.616 --> 01:44:09.409
stirring things up, huh?

1320
01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:11.286
-Is it true?
-What?

1321
01:44:12.496 --> 01:44:14.206
That reporter business?

1322
01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.875
What do you want
to know here, kid?

1323
01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:19.628
Did you kill him?
For my father?

1324
01:44:19.711 --> 01:44:23.298
Look, your father
was in trouble.

1325
01:44:23.382 --> 01:44:25.217
This reporter had some dirt.

1326
01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.844
Some very

1327
01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:30.681
personal stuff
about your mother,

1328
01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.015
her family history.

1329
01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.600
You know, everybody's got
their dirty laundry,

1330
01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:34.977
that's just how it is.

1331
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.144
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1332
01:44:36.228 --> 01:44:38.397
not right before the election.

1333
01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.691
And your father
tried to pay the guy off,

1334
01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:42.651
but he wasn't going for it.

1335
01:44:42.734 --> 01:44:44.319
So...

1336
01:44:44.403 --> 01:44:45.737
he came to me.

1337
01:44:45.821 --> 01:44:48.365
Well, I never seen him
like that.

1338
01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:51.535
He said, "Carmine,

1339
01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:56.540
"I want you to put
the fear of God in this guy."

1340
01:44:58.834 --> 01:45:01.878
And when fear isn't enough...

1341
01:45:02.587 --> 01:45:04.047
Oof. Hmm.

1342
01:45:05.507 --> 01:45:09.011
Your father wanted me
to handle it, so I did.

1343
01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.847
I handled it.

1344
01:45:13.515 --> 01:45:14.808
I know.

1345
01:45:14.891 --> 01:45:17.310
You thought your father
was a Boy Scout.

1346
01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:20.272
But you'd be surprised

1347
01:45:20.355 --> 01:45:22.691
what even a good man like him

1348
01:45:22.774 --> 01:45:25.527
is capable of
in the right situation.

1349
01:45:27.738 --> 01:45:29.406
Do me a favor.

1350
01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:31.616
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1351
01:45:32.325 --> 01:45:33.910
This reporter

1352
01:45:34.703 --> 01:45:36.246
was a lowlife.

1353
01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.873
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1354
01:45:39.416 --> 01:45:41.585
-Maroni?
-Oh, yeah.

1355
01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:45.756
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1356
01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:48.091
And... And after what happened
with that reporter,

1357
01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.843
Maroni was worried

1358
01:45:49.926 --> 01:45:52.429
that your father
would be in my pocket

1359
01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:54.639
forever.

1360
01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:56.767
He would have done anything

1361
01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:59.102
to keep him
from becoming mayor.

1362
01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.562
You understand?

1363
01:46:01.730 --> 01:46:03.023
Are you saying

1364
01:46:03.106 --> 01:46:06.276
Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1365
01:46:06.359 --> 01:46:08.445
Do I know it for a fact?

1366
01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:12.949
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1367
01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:16.495
This is what you wanted, huh?

1368
01:46:16.578 --> 01:46:19.331
This little conversation here?

1369
01:46:21.416 --> 01:46:23.710
It's been
a long time coming, huh?

1370
01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:28.465
I mean,
you ain't a kid no more.

1371
01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:39.452
You lied to me...

1372
01:47:42.247 --> 01:47:43.915
my whole life.

1373
01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:51.131
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1374
01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.262
He told me what he did
for my father.

1375
01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:02.893
About Salvatore Maroni.

1376
01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:07.397
He told you
Salvatore Maroni...

1377
01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:09.316
Had my father killed.

1378
01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:13.987
Why didn't you tell me
all this?

1379
01:48:16.531 --> 01:48:21.661
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1380
01:48:21.745 --> 01:48:24.080
believing that he was
a good man.

1381
01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:26.374
He was a good man.

1382
01:48:26.458 --> 01:48:28.084
You listen to me.

1383
01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:31.713
Your father was a good man.

1384
01:48:35.425 --> 01:48:37.427
-He made a mistake.
-A "mistake."

1385
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:39.512
He had a man killed.

1386
01:48:39.596 --> 01:48:41.681
Why?

1387
01:48:41.765 --> 01:48:45.101
To protect his family image?

1388
01:48:46.102 --> 01:48:47.270
His political aspirations?

1389
01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.813
It wasn't to protect
the family image,

1390
01:48:48.897 --> 01:48:51.066
and he didn't have
anyone killed.

1391
01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:55.779
He was protecting your mother.

1392
01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:59.616
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1393
01:48:59.699 --> 01:49:01.910
He cared about her

1394
01:49:01.993 --> 01:49:03.370
and you,

1395
01:49:03.453 --> 01:49:06.039
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1396
01:49:06.122 --> 01:49:10.460
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1397
01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:12.170
Your father should have known

1398
01:49:12.254 --> 01:49:13.880
that Falcone would do anything

1399
01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:17.133
to finally have something
on him that he could use.

1400
01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:19.052
That's who Falcone is.

1401
01:49:21.221 --> 01:49:23.556
And that was
your father's mistake.

1402
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.642
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1403
01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:29.145
your father was distraught.

1404
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:32.482
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1405
01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:34.901
that he would confess
everything.

1406
01:49:36.361 --> 01:49:38.321
And that night,

1407
01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:41.157
your father and your mother

1408
01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:42.409
were killed.

1409
01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:49.582
It was Falcone?

1410
01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:57.757
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1411
01:50:02.304 --> 01:50:05.932
Or maybe it was some
random thug on the street

1412
01:50:06.016 --> 01:50:07.475
who needed money, got scared,

1413
01:50:07.559 --> 01:50:08.852
and pulled the trigger
too fast.

1414
01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:12.022
If you don't think
I've spent every day

1415
01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:14.190
searching for that answer...

1416
01:50:15.734 --> 01:50:20.280
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1417
01:50:20.363 --> 01:50:22.324
I know you always
blamed yourself.

1418
01:50:22.407 --> 01:50:24.909
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1419
01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:29.331
I could see the fear
in your eyes,

1420
01:50:30.623 --> 01:50:33.043
but I didn't know how to help.

1421
01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:36.796
I could teach you
how to fight,

1422
01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.716
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1423
01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:41.676
You needed a father.

1424
01:50:43.553 --> 01:50:46.056
And all you had was me.

1425
01:50:48.391 --> 01:50:49.642
I'm sorry.

1426
01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:53.313
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1427
01:51:00.111 --> 01:51:01.196
God.

1428
01:51:04.032 --> 01:51:08.578
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1429
01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:13.416
I thought
I'd mastered all that.

1430
01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:21.132
I mean,

1431
01:51:22.258 --> 01:51:24.469
I'm not afraid to die.

1432
01:51:26.096 --> 01:51:28.598
I realize now
there's something

1433
01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:31.601
I haven't got past.

1434
01:51:32.477 --> 01:51:34.270
This fear...

1435
01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:39.692
of ever going through
any of that again.

1436
01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:46.116
Of losing somebody
I care about.

1437
01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:37.792
Hey.

1438
01:52:37.876 --> 01:52:40.503
I saw the signal.
That's not you?

1439
01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:42.464
I thought it was you.

1440
01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:56.853
-I found him!
-I see that.

1441
01:52:56.936 --> 01:52:58.438
He had my shit and my phone.

1442
01:52:58.521 --> 01:53:00.064
She left a message
the night they took her.

1443
01:53:00.148 --> 01:53:02.525
-She called me...
-Gordon! Help me out, man!

1444
01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:04.152
She got my gun!

1445
01:53:05.487 --> 01:53:08.281
-Shut up!
-Put the gun down.

1446
01:53:08.364 --> 01:53:11.117
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1447
01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.749
-Here. Listen.

1448
01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:21.544
Hey! Get back here!

1449
01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:22.879
-Where you going?

1450
01:53:22.962 --> 01:53:24.464
Come back here!

1451
01:53:24.547 --> 01:53:25.798
Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1452
01:53:25.882 --> 01:53:27.217
You're scaring her.

1453
01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.885
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1454
01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:30.220
Please, please, please.

1455
01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:31.721
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1456
01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.474
Hey, don't be scared.
Come here.

1457
01:53:36.309 --> 01:53:38.895
Now let me ask you again.

1458
01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:41.564
-What did Mitchell tell you?
-No, nothing. He...

1459
01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:44.609
Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1460
01:53:44.692 --> 01:53:47.862
Especially to pretty girls
like you.

1461
01:53:47.946 --> 01:53:50.573
That's why I made him
take your passport,

1462
01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:53.493
until we could have
this little conversation.

1463
01:53:53.576 --> 01:53:56.287
All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1464
01:53:56.371 --> 01:53:58.164
You'll never hear from me
again, nobody will.

1465
01:53:58.248 --> 01:53:59.832
Please, please...

1466
01:53:59.916 --> 01:54:02.585
We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1467
01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:06.089
But first, I gotta know...

1468
01:54:06.172 --> 01:54:08.216
-What did he tell you?
-He...

1469
01:54:08.299 --> 01:54:12.345
He just said they all made
a deal with you.

1470
01:54:12.428 --> 01:54:15.765
Oh. Hmm.
He told you about that, huh?

1471
01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:17.100
The deal.

1472
01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:18.685
He said

1473
01:54:18.768 --> 01:54:22.021
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1474
01:54:22.105 --> 01:54:24.774
and that's how
he became mayor.

1475
01:54:24.857 --> 01:54:27.402
He said you were
a very important man.

1476
01:54:27.485 --> 01:54:28.653
Right.

1477
01:54:29.362 --> 01:54:30.697
Mm-hmm.

1478
01:54:31.614 --> 01:54:33.908
Hmm. Okay.

1479
01:54:41.332 --> 01:54:42.792
-Just take it easy.

1480
01:54:42.875 --> 01:54:44.419
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1481
01:54:44.502 --> 01:54:47.630
Take it easy.

1482
01:54:56.806 --> 01:54:58.141
Rata Alada.

1483
01:55:03.062 --> 01:55:04.856
A falcon has wings, too.

1484
01:55:04.939 --> 01:55:06.858
Falcone is the rat?

1485
01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:21.497
Falcone works for you guys?

1486
01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:24.167
The mayor? The DA?

1487
01:55:27.128 --> 01:55:28.796
No.

1488
01:55:31.299 --> 01:55:32.634
We work for him.

1489
01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:34.886
Everybody does.

1490
01:55:34.969 --> 01:55:36.012
How?

1491
01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:38.264
Through Renewal.

1492
01:55:38.348 --> 01:55:39.641
Renewal is everything.

1493
01:55:39.724 --> 01:55:41.684
-The Renewal Fund?
-Yeah.

1494
01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:42.935
After Thomas Wayne died,

1495
01:55:43.019 --> 01:55:45.355
they all went after it
like vultures.

1496
01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:49.192
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1497
01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:51.444
It was perfect
for making bribes,

1498
01:55:51.527 --> 01:55:52.737
laundering money.

1499
01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:54.656
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1500
01:55:54.739 --> 01:55:56.532
Everybody got a piece.

1501
01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.534
But Falcone wanted more.

1502
01:56:00.328 --> 01:56:03.706
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1503
01:56:04.874 --> 01:56:07.377
He'd rat out
his drops operation,

1504
01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:10.338
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1505
01:56:10.421 --> 01:56:12.799
then install them all
as his puppets.

1506
01:56:12.882 --> 01:56:15.593
You think this goddamn
election matters?

1507
01:56:17.136 --> 01:56:19.722
Falcone's the mayor.

1508
01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:22.433
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1509
01:56:22.517 --> 01:56:24.435
Come on, Vengeance.

1510
01:56:24.519 --> 01:56:26.979
Let's go kill
that son of a bitch.

1511
01:56:27.063 --> 01:56:28.439
This creep too.
Let's finish this.

1512
01:56:28.523 --> 01:56:29.649
-Oh, God!
-No!

1513
01:56:31.192 --> 01:56:32.819
We'll get him.

1514
01:56:32.902 --> 01:56:34.904
-But not that way.
-There is no other way!

1515
01:56:34.987 --> 01:56:38.116
-He owns the city!
-Cross that line,

1516
01:56:38.199 --> 01:56:40.201
you'll become just like him.

1517
01:56:40.284 --> 01:56:41.744
Listen to me.

1518
01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:43.830
Don't throw your life away.

1519
01:56:50.253 --> 01:56:51.713
Don't worry, honey.

1520
01:56:54.716 --> 01:56:56.050
I got nine of 'em.

1521
01:56:56.134 --> 01:56:58.344
-No, don't! Hey, hey!

1522
01:57:10.273 --> 01:57:11.858
She won't
get out of there alive.

1523
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:14.110
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1524
01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:16.487
-I have to stop her.
-Don't you mean "we"?

1525
01:57:17.739 --> 01:57:19.574
I gotta do this my way.

1526
01:57:19.657 --> 01:57:20.700
And then what?

1527
01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:23.619
We do what Riddler said.

1528
01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.413
Bring the rat into the light.

1529
01:58:01.157 --> 01:58:03.242
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1530
01:58:03.326 --> 01:58:05.328
He ain't seein' nobody
tonight.

1531
01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:06.871
Tell him it's about Annika.

1532
01:58:10.082 --> 01:58:12.084
Hey!

1533
01:58:12.168 --> 01:58:13.628
Look who it is, huh?

1534
01:58:13.711 --> 01:58:16.047
-Sorry to bother you.
-Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1535
01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:18.299
I was just hoping I could
talk to you for a minute?

1536
01:58:18.382 --> 01:58:19.884
Absolutely.

1537
01:58:21.636 --> 01:58:22.595
Alone?

1538
01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:40.363
Hey!

1539
01:58:50.623 --> 01:58:51.874
I'm just so worried.

1540
01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:53.709
I... I don't know
where she is.

1541
01:58:55.253 --> 01:58:58.714
And I know that
you're a very important man.

1542
01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:01.676
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1543
01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:07.431
because she's been gone
so long, I'm beginning to...

1544
01:59:07.515 --> 01:59:10.017
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1545
01:59:10.101 --> 01:59:12.270
-I'm so sorry.
-I understand. Here.

1546
01:59:12.353 --> 01:59:15.356
No, that's okay,
I have a tissue.

1547
01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:21.237
-Mr. Falcone?
-Vinnie!

1548
01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.072
-Didn't I tell you?
-I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1549
01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:25.366
I really think you're gonna
want to see this.

1550
01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:28.995
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1551
01:59:29.078 --> 01:59:30.413
I'll be right back.

1552
01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:47.096
Holy shit.

1553
01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:48.806
That recording,
provided to GC-1

1554
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:51.142
by Lieutenant James Gordon
of the Gotham PD.

1555
01:59:51.225 --> 01:59:52.435
And we should warn you,

1556
01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:54.103
the contents
are extremely graphic,

1557
01:59:54.186 --> 01:59:56.939
and some of you
may find it disturbing.

1558
01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:59.025
He just said

1559
01:59:59.108 --> 02:00:01.027
they all made a deal with you.

1560
02:00:01.110 --> 02:00:02.320
Oh. Hmm.

1561
02:00:02.403 --> 02:00:04.155
He told you about that, huh?

1562
02:00:04.238 --> 02:00:05.740
The deal.

1563
02:00:05.823 --> 02:00:07.283
He said

1564
02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:10.620
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1565
02:00:10.703 --> 02:00:13.414
and that's how
he became mayor.

1566
02:00:13.497 --> 02:00:16.208
He said you were
a very important man.

1567
02:00:16.292 --> 02:00:17.335
Right.

1568
02:00:18.252 --> 02:00:20.671
Hmm. Okay.

1569
02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.431
Revelations
of Mr. Falcone's secret role

1570
02:00:30.514 --> 02:00:31.682
as a mafia informant...

1571
02:00:32.266 --> 02:00:33.517
Hey, Dad.

1572
02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:36.020
What?

1573
02:00:36.103 --> 02:00:38.230
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1574
02:00:40.107 --> 02:00:41.609
You remember her?

1575
02:00:43.194 --> 02:00:44.236
Yeah.

1576
02:00:45.738 --> 02:00:46.781
Just...

1577
02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:49.867
Just put down the gun, honey.

1578
02:00:49.951 --> 02:00:51.118
This is for my mother.

1579
02:01:48.259 --> 02:01:49.468
I see him!

1580
02:02:33.345 --> 02:02:35.222
You don't think this hurts me?

1581
02:02:38.934 --> 02:02:42.104
-My own flesh and blood, huh?

1582
02:02:58.412 --> 02:03:00.289
You made me do this.

1583
02:03:01.624 --> 02:03:03.501
Just like your mother.

1584
02:03:09.465 --> 02:03:10.841
He has to pay!

1585
02:03:14.637 --> 02:03:15.805
You don't have to pay
with him.

1586
02:03:19.475 --> 02:03:21.018
You paid enough.

1587
02:03:55.553 --> 02:03:56.762
Jesus.

1588
02:03:56.846 --> 02:03:59.265
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1589
02:03:59.348 --> 02:04:00.558
You think
you're gonna scare me

1590
02:04:00.641 --> 02:04:02.434
with that mask and that cape?

1591
02:04:02.518 --> 02:04:04.728
I'm gonna start crying,
and all of a sudden,

1592
02:04:04.812 --> 02:04:06.480
some big secret's comin' out?

1593
02:04:06.564 --> 02:04:08.232
Let me tell you something.

1594
02:04:08.315 --> 02:04:10.025
Whatever I know,

1595
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:11.944
whatever I've done,

1596
02:04:12.027 --> 02:04:14.613
it's all going with me

1597
02:04:14.697 --> 02:04:16.448
to my grave.

1598
02:04:26.792 --> 02:04:28.919
What, are you with Zorro
over here?

1599
02:04:30.337 --> 02:04:32.840
Don't you know you boys
in blue work for me?

1600
02:04:40.598 --> 02:04:43.017
I guess
we don't all work for you.

1601
02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:54.195
You have the right
to remain silent.

1602
02:04:54.278 --> 02:04:56.572
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1603
02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:57.907
in a court of law.

1604
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:59.408
You have the right
to an attorney.

1605
02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:00.743
If you cannot afford one,

1606
02:05:00.826 --> 02:05:02.411
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1607
02:05:02.494 --> 02:05:04.330
Do you understand
these rights?

1608
02:05:05.706 --> 02:05:07.374
Do you understand?

1609
02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.419
Yeah.

1610
02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:12.421
I'll see you when I walk out.

1611
02:05:12.504 --> 02:05:13.923
With these rights in mind,

1612
02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.007
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1613
02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:16.383
Goddamn rat.

1614
02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:19.511
What'd you say?

1615
02:05:19.595 --> 02:05:21.513
Enjoy your night
at Blackgate, Carmine.

1616
02:05:22.556 --> 02:05:23.766
Probably be your last.

1617
02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:27.144
Oh-ho! So you're
a big man now, Oz, huh?

1618
02:05:27.228 --> 02:05:28.312
Maybe I am.

1619
02:05:28.395 --> 02:05:29.939
Really, Oz?

1620
02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:34.443
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1621
02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:35.736
I'll spray paint your ass!

1622
02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:40.991
What are you doing?
It wasn't me!

1623
02:05:41.075 --> 02:05:43.244
I didn't shoot!
I didn't shoot!

1624
02:05:44.495 --> 02:05:45.829
Get your hands off of me!

1625
02:06:05.474 --> 02:06:07.559
"Bring him into the light.

1626
02:06:11.021 --> 02:06:13.065
And you'll find
where I'm at."

1627
02:06:13.148 --> 02:06:14.149
There!

1628
02:06:14.233 --> 02:06:16.151
The shots came from up there!

1629
02:06:17.695 --> 02:06:18.654
It's Riddler.

1630
02:06:20.656 --> 02:06:21.865
Gage, on me.

1631
02:06:21.949 --> 02:06:23.117
Martinez, around back.

1632
02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.827
Nobody gets in there,
nobody gets out!

1633
02:07:39.234 --> 02:07:40.486
He's gone.

1634
02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:52.081
He's been here
this whole time.

1635
02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:54.375
-Lieutenant. Martinez.
-Yeah?

1636
02:07:54.458 --> 02:07:55.876
Lieutenant,
we got a witness here,

1637
02:07:55.959 --> 02:07:57.378
says she saw someone
coming down

1638
02:07:57.461 --> 02:07:58.879
the fire escape
right after the shot.

1639
02:07:58.962 --> 02:08:00.881
She said he went
into the corner diner.

1640
02:08:00.964 --> 02:08:04.093
The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.

1641
02:08:19.650 --> 02:08:21.735
Police! Hands up!

1642
02:08:24.571 --> 02:08:26.657
He said put
your goddamn hands up,

1643
02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:28.700
you son of a bitch.

1644
02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:49.304
I just ordered
a slice of pumpkin pie.

1645
02:08:52.182 --> 02:08:53.559
Stay still!

1646
02:08:53.642 --> 02:08:54.643
Now!

1647
02:09:23.130 --> 02:09:24.965
Which one is you?

1648
02:09:25.048 --> 02:09:27.342
You tell me.

1649
02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:28.927
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1650
02:09:31.847 --> 02:09:33.682
Get that son of a bitch
out of here!

1651
02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.573
...where even murdered mayor

1652
02:09:49.656 --> 02:09:51.325
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife
and son

1653
02:09:51.408 --> 02:09:54.203
have gathered in an
emotional show of city unity.

1654
02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:55.621
Our Dan O'Neil is live

1655
02:09:55.704 --> 02:09:56.788
inside Real's headquarters
right now...

1656
02:09:56.872 --> 02:09:57.915
Hey.

1657
02:10:22.272 --> 02:10:23.899
What are all these diaries?

1658
02:10:23.982 --> 02:10:26.360
They're ledgers.
He's got thousands.

1659
02:10:26.443 --> 02:10:29.988
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1660
02:10:30.072 --> 02:10:31.573
Got something back
on one of the IDs.

1661
02:10:31.657 --> 02:10:33.951
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1662
02:10:34.034 --> 02:10:35.911
-He's a forensic accountant.
-Accountant?

1663
02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:38.455
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1664
02:10:38.539 --> 02:10:40.415
What about chain of evidence?

1665
02:10:41.166 --> 02:10:42.459
You should see this.

1666
02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:49.925
He's wearing gloves.

1667
02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:53.428
"Friday, July 16th.

1668
02:10:53.512 --> 02:10:57.558
My life has been a cruel
riddle I could not solve,

1669
02:10:57.641 --> 02:11:00.644
suffocating my mind,
no escape.

1670
02:11:00.727 --> 02:11:02.312
But then, today, I saw it.

1671
02:11:02.396 --> 02:11:06.525
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1672
02:11:07.859 --> 02:11:09.444
'Renewal.'

1673
02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:11.613
The empty promise
they sold to me

1674
02:11:11.697 --> 02:11:14.032
as a child in that orphanage.

1675
02:11:14.116 --> 02:11:17.119
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1676
02:11:17.202 --> 02:11:20.581
My whole life has been
preparing me for this.

1677
02:11:20.664 --> 02:11:23.125
The moment
when I would learn the truth.

1678
02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:24.918
When I could finally
strike back

1679
02:11:25.002 --> 02:11:27.296
-and expose their lies."

1680
02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:31.091
"If you want people to
understand, really understand,

1681
02:11:31.174 --> 02:11:33.552
you can't just
give them the answers.

1682
02:11:33.635 --> 02:11:34.970
You have to confront them,

1683
02:11:35.053 --> 02:11:37.598
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1684
02:11:37.681 --> 02:11:39.933
just like they tortured me.

1685
02:11:40.017 --> 02:11:42.811
I know now
what I must become."

1686
02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.024
Jesus.

1687
02:11:52.988 --> 02:11:55.490
I don't think that rat
likes you, man.

1688
02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:56.950
This one's not a rat.

1689
02:12:13.717 --> 02:12:14.926
What is that?

1690
02:12:46.375 --> 02:12:47.709
Some kind of pry tool?

1691
02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.044
Is it a chisel?

1692
02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:50.587
It's a murder weapon.

1693
02:12:50.671 --> 02:12:52.547
He killed Mitchell with it.

1694
02:12:52.631 --> 02:12:54.383
The edge will match
the floorboard impression

1695
02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:55.634
in the mayor's study.

1696
02:13:04.267 --> 02:13:06.228
"My confession"?

1697
02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:07.562
What's he confessing to?

1698
02:13:07.646 --> 02:13:09.356
He already told us
he killed Mitchell.

1699
02:13:09.439 --> 02:13:10.691
This isn't over.

1700
02:13:10.774 --> 02:13:11.942
Oh, man.

1701
02:13:12.025 --> 02:13:13.527
He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1702
02:13:13.610 --> 02:13:16.071
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1703
02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:26.081
His final post was last night.

1704
02:13:26.164 --> 02:13:27.541
Some video.

1705
02:13:27.624 --> 02:13:29.376
Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1706
02:13:29.459 --> 02:13:30.836
Can you get in?

1707
02:13:30.919 --> 02:13:32.546
Copying his drive now.

1708
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:36.007
Take some time,
but we'll get in.

1709
02:13:47.144 --> 02:13:49.855
-Show me the post.
-It's right here.

1710
02:13:51.565 --> 02:13:53.942
"The Truth Unmasked."

1711
02:13:54.025 --> 02:13:55.694
I think I'm his last target.

1712
02:13:58.280 --> 02:13:59.531
You?

1713
02:13:59.614 --> 02:14:01.783
Maybe this is all
coming to an end.

1714
02:14:02.325 --> 02:14:04.035
What is?

1715
02:14:04.119 --> 02:14:05.454
The Batman.

1716
02:14:10.959 --> 02:14:12.127
Yeah?

1717
02:14:23.388 --> 02:14:24.639
Right.

1718
02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:31.480
Riddler's asking for you.
At Arkham.

1719
02:14:38.862 --> 02:14:40.405
You're a good cop.

1720
02:15:04.763 --> 02:15:07.849
I told you
I'd see you in hell.

1721
02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:10.018
What do you
want from me?

1722
02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:12.020
"Want"?

1723
02:15:12.103 --> 02:15:13.522
If only you knew how long

1724
02:15:13.605 --> 02:15:15.816
I've been waiting
for this day.

1725
02:15:16.942 --> 02:15:19.110
For this moment.

1726
02:15:19.194 --> 02:15:23.198
I've been invisible
my whole life.

1727
02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:26.076
I guess I won't be anymore,
will I?

1728
02:15:27.536 --> 02:15:29.913
They'll remember me now.

1729
02:15:29.996 --> 02:15:31.957
They'll remember both of us.

1730
02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.302
Bruce...

1731
02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:49.015
Wayne.

1732
02:15:51.309 --> 02:15:55.146
Bruce...

1733
02:15:56.565 --> 02:15:59.442
Wayne.

1734
02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:13.081
You know,
I was there that day.

1735
02:16:15.584 --> 02:16:17.335
The day the great Thomas Wayne

1736
02:16:17.419 --> 02:16:18.920
announced
he was running for mayor,

1737
02:16:19.004 --> 02:16:21.506
made all those promises.

1738
02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:25.427
Well, a week later
he was dead,

1739
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:28.513
and everybody
just forgot about us.

1740
02:16:28.597 --> 02:16:32.309
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

1741
02:16:32.392 --> 02:16:36.188
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

1742
02:16:36.771 --> 02:16:38.315
Orphan.

1743
02:16:43.904 --> 02:16:47.240
Living in some tower
over the park

1744
02:16:47.324 --> 02:16:50.201
isn't being an orphan.

1745
02:16:50.285 --> 02:16:55.665
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

1746
02:16:55.749 --> 02:16:57.375
Don't you tell me.

1747
02:16:59.878 --> 02:17:02.881
Do you know
what being an orphan is?

1748
02:17:02.964 --> 02:17:06.635
It's 30 kids to a room.

1749
02:17:06.718 --> 02:17:09.304
Twelve years old
and already a drophead,

1750
02:17:09.387 --> 02:17:10.972
numbing the pain.

1751
02:17:12.557 --> 02:17:13.850
You wake up screaming

1752
02:17:13.934 --> 02:17:18.229
with rats
chewing your fingers.

1753
02:17:18.313 --> 02:17:21.608
And every winter
one of the babies die

1754
02:17:21.691 --> 02:17:24.027
because it's so cold.

1755
02:17:25.278 --> 02:17:27.906
But, oh, no.

1756
02:17:30.659 --> 02:17:32.619
Let's talk
about the billionaire

1757
02:17:32.702 --> 02:17:34.204
with the lying, dead daddy,

1758
02:17:34.287 --> 02:17:36.957
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

1759
02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:38.083
Doesn't it?

1760
02:17:39.501 --> 02:17:41.586
Bruce...

1761
02:17:42.587 --> 02:17:44.547
Wayne.

1762
02:17:48.051 --> 02:17:51.304
He's the only one
we didn't get.

1763
02:17:54.516 --> 02:17:59.020
But we got the rest of 'em,
didn't we?

1764
02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:03.191
All those slick,
sleazy, phony pricks.

1765
02:18:06.278 --> 02:18:07.487
God.

1766
02:18:08.446 --> 02:18:09.781
Look at you.

1767
02:18:11.366 --> 02:18:13.743
Your mask is amazing.

1768
02:18:13.827 --> 02:18:16.871
I wish you could've
seen me in mine.

1769
02:18:16.955 --> 02:18:18.206
Ain't it funny?

1770
02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.542
All everyone wants to do
is unmask you,

1771
02:18:20.625 --> 02:18:22.585
but they're missing the point.

1772
02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:26.798
You and I both know,

1773
02:18:26.881 --> 02:18:29.384
I'm looking at the real you
right now.

1774
02:18:29.467 --> 02:18:31.720
My mask allowed me
to be myself,

1775
02:18:31.803 --> 02:18:33.221
completely.

1776
02:18:33.305 --> 02:18:34.889
No shame,

1777
02:18:35.765 --> 02:18:36.850
no limits.

1778
02:18:36.933 --> 02:18:38.560
Why did you write me?

1779
02:18:39.436 --> 02:18:40.520
What do you mean?

1780
02:18:40.603 --> 02:18:42.188
All those cards.

1781
02:18:42.272 --> 02:18:43.815
I told you,

1782
02:18:43.898 --> 02:18:44.983
we've been
doing this together.

1783
02:18:45.066 --> 02:18:46.317
You're a part of this.

1784
02:18:46.401 --> 02:18:47.277
We didn't do
anything together.

1785
02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:48.319
We did.

1786
02:18:48.403 --> 02:18:50.030
What did we just do?

1787
02:18:50.113 --> 02:18:51.948
I asked you to bring him
into the light, and you did.

1788
02:18:52.032 --> 02:18:53.199
We're such a good team.

1789
02:18:53.283 --> 02:18:54.617
We're not a team.

1790
02:18:54.701 --> 02:18:56.745
I never could have gotten him
out of there.

1791
02:18:56.828 --> 02:18:59.205
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

1792
02:18:59.289 --> 02:19:02.584
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

1793
02:19:02.667 --> 02:19:04.377
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1794
02:19:04.461 --> 02:19:05.712
You gave me that.

1795
02:19:05.795 --> 02:19:06.921
I gave you nothing.

1796
02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:09.299
You showed me
what was possible.

1797
02:19:09.382 --> 02:19:12.510
You showed me
all it takes is fear

1798
02:19:12.594 --> 02:19:14.471
and a little focused violence.

1799
02:19:14.554 --> 02:19:16.097
You inspired me.

1800
02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:17.766
You're out
of your goddamn mind.

1801
02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:20.351
What?

1802
02:19:20.435 --> 02:19:22.103
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

1803
02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:23.563
How can you say that?

1804
02:19:23.646 --> 02:19:25.148
You think
you'll be remembered?

1805
02:19:25.231 --> 02:19:27.275
You're a pathetic psychopath,

1806
02:19:27.358 --> 02:19:29.069
-begging for attention.
-No.

1807
02:19:29.152 --> 02:19:30.403
You're gonna die alone
in Arkham.

1808
02:19:30.487 --> 02:19:33.114
-No. No, no, no!
-A nobody!

1809
02:19:34.866 --> 02:19:36.701
No!

1810
02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:40.955
Ahhh!

1811
02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:43.833
This is not how
this was supposed to go!

1812
02:19:44.793 --> 02:19:48.296
Ahhh!

1813
02:19:48.379 --> 02:19:51.925
I had it all planned out!

1814
02:19:52.008 --> 02:19:54.260
We were gonna be safe here.

1815
02:19:54.344 --> 02:19:57.764
We could watch
the whole thing together.

1816
02:19:57.847 --> 02:19:58.932
Watch what?

1817
02:19:59.015 --> 02:20:00.767
Everything!

1818
02:20:08.983 --> 02:20:10.693
It was all there.

1819
02:20:12.654 --> 02:20:15.198
You mean,
you didn't figure it out?

1820
02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:23.414
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

1821
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.836
I guess I gave you
too much credit.

1822
02:20:27.919 --> 02:20:29.671
What have you done?

1823
02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:34.843
What's black and blue
and dead all over?

1824
02:20:37.637 --> 02:20:39.472
You.

1825
02:20:40.974 --> 02:20:43.309
If you think you can stop
what's coming.

1826
02:20:44.561 --> 02:20:47.439
What have you done?

1827
02:20:47.522 --> 02:20:53.736
âª Ave Maria âª

1828
02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:55.822
What have you done?

1829
02:20:58.199 --> 02:20:59.659
âª Gratia plenaâª

1830
02:20:59.742 --> 02:21:01.244
What have you done?

1831
02:21:05.206 --> 02:21:08.626
âª Mariaâª

1832
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:14.340
âª Gratia plenaâª

1833
02:21:46.122 --> 02:21:48.374
Hey!

1834
02:21:48.458 --> 02:21:49.834
What are you doing in here?

1835
02:22:07.519 --> 02:22:10.355
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1836
02:22:16.736 --> 02:22:19.948
Boy, this guy's
a real nutjob, huh?

1837
02:22:20.031 --> 02:22:22.992
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1838
02:22:27.538 --> 02:22:30.541
My uncle's a...
He's an installer.

1839
02:22:30.625 --> 02:22:32.877
You know, it's a...
Oh, you know.

1840
02:22:32.961 --> 02:22:35.296
It's a... a tucker.

1841
02:22:52.981 --> 02:22:53.982
Huh.

1842
02:23:09.122 --> 02:23:10.832
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1843
02:23:10.915 --> 02:23:12.000
What are you doing?

1844
02:23:12.083 --> 02:23:13.626
What are you doing?

1845
02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:45.700
Hey, guys.

1846
02:23:45.783 --> 02:23:47.869
Uh, thanks
for all the comments,

1847
02:23:47.952 --> 02:23:49.537
and, uh, a special thanks
to everyone

1848
02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:51.080
for the tips on detonators.

1849
02:23:51.164 --> 02:23:52.373
Detonators?

1850
02:23:52.457 --> 02:23:53.875
I just want to say
this will be

1851
02:23:53.958 --> 02:23:57.337
my last post
for a little while, and, uh...

1852
02:23:59.422 --> 02:24:01.549
what this community
has meant to me

1853
02:24:01.632 --> 02:24:05.470
these weeks, these months,

1854
02:24:05.553 --> 02:24:08.097
let's just say none of us...

1855
02:24:09.724 --> 02:24:11.934
is alone anymore. Okay?

1856
02:24:12.644 --> 02:24:14.145
Jesus.

1857
02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:22.362
Tomorrow's Election Day.

1858
02:24:23.654 --> 02:24:26.407
And Bella Real will win.

1859
02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:29.577
She promised real change.

1860
02:24:29.661 --> 02:24:32.080
But we know the truth,
don't we?

1861
02:24:32.163 --> 02:24:34.248
You've seen
Gotham's true face now.

1862
02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:36.250
Together, we've unmasked it.

1863
02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:39.170
Its corruption, its perversion

1864
02:24:39.253 --> 02:24:43.216
masquerading
under the guise of renewal.

1865
02:24:43.299 --> 02:24:47.220
But unmasking is not enough.

1866
02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:53.393
The day of judgment
is finally upon us.

1867
02:24:53.476 --> 02:24:55.895
And now it is time

1868
02:24:56.896 --> 02:24:59.273
for retribution.

1869
02:24:59.357 --> 02:25:02.276
I've parked seven vans

1870
02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:04.821
all along the city seawall.

1871
02:25:05.947 --> 02:25:07.907
And on the big night,

1872
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:10.243
they will go boom.

1873
02:25:24.215 --> 02:25:26.509
-Boom!

1874
02:25:31.013 --> 02:25:32.890
-Boom!

1875
02:25:35.059 --> 02:25:37.186
When the vans blow,

1876
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:39.981
the flooding
will happen so fast,

1877
02:25:40.064 --> 02:25:43.151
evacuation
will not be an option.

1878
02:25:43.234 --> 02:25:46.154
Those who are not
washed away

1879
02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:48.656
will race through the streets
in terror.

1880
02:25:48.739 --> 02:25:50.616
-Call Gordon.

1881
02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:52.827
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1882
02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:56.539
As breaking news
hits higher ground

1883
02:25:56.622 --> 02:25:58.332
in Gotham Square Garden,

1884
02:25:58.416 --> 02:26:01.043
celebrations
will turn to panic,

1885
02:26:01.127 --> 02:26:02.795
as the venue becomes

1886
02:26:02.879 --> 02:26:06.007
the city's shelter
of last resort.

1887
02:26:07.467 --> 02:26:11.429
And that's where
all of you come in.

1888
02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:20.938
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

1889
02:26:21.022 --> 02:26:23.357
The pigs will have me
in their custody,

1890
02:26:23.441 --> 02:26:25.359
but that's okay.

1891
02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:29.947
Because then
it will be your turn.

1892
02:26:30.031 --> 02:26:34.285
You'll be there, waiting.

1893
02:26:44.921 --> 02:26:47.798
It's time for the lies
to finally end.

1894
02:26:47.882 --> 02:26:52.386
False promises of renewal?

1895
02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:53.804
Change?

1896
02:26:53.888 --> 02:26:57.391
We'll give them real,
real change now.

1897
02:26:57.475 --> 02:27:00.853
We've spent our lives
in this wretched place,

1898
02:27:00.937 --> 02:27:02.980
suffering!

1899
02:27:03.064 --> 02:27:05.399
Wondering, "Why us?"

1900
02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:08.736
Now they will spend their
last moments wondering,

1901
02:27:08.819 --> 02:27:10.905
why them?

1902
02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:13.199
I can't get through!
The lines are down.

1903
02:27:18.704 --> 02:27:21.332
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1904
02:27:21.415 --> 02:27:23.042
I'm just trying
to get out of town, man!

1905
02:27:23.125 --> 02:27:26.045
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1906
02:27:26.128 --> 02:27:27.505
You're gonna have to go
inside the Garden

1907
02:27:27.588 --> 02:27:28.923
-with everyone else.

1908
02:27:37.723 --> 02:27:39.559
-Lieutenant, who's in charge?
-I really don't know.

1909
02:27:39.642 --> 02:27:41.143
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1910
02:27:41.227 --> 02:27:43.062
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1911
02:27:43.145 --> 02:27:44.480
We got an active situation.

1912
02:27:44.564 --> 02:27:46.232
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1913
02:27:46.315 --> 02:27:47.650
and get the mayor-elect out
of here, now. Where is she?

1914
02:27:47.733 --> 02:27:48.985
-I can take you there.
-Come!

1915
02:28:24.854 --> 02:28:26.314
If we don't close
the doors, we're gonna have...

1916
02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:27.648
-MCU.
-...huge problems.

1917
02:28:27.732 --> 02:28:29.150
The water's
already started to breach.

1918
02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:30.192
I thought this was a shelter
of last resort.

1919
02:28:30.276 --> 02:28:31.527
Yeah, for a hurricane,

1920
02:28:31.611 --> 02:28:33.237
but not if the whole seawall
comes down.

1921
02:28:33.321 --> 02:28:34.739
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1922
02:28:34.822 --> 02:28:36.449
All right.
I'll go calm down the crowd

1923
02:28:36.532 --> 02:28:38.159
-so we can get everyone in.
-It's not safe for you here.

1924
02:28:38.242 --> 02:28:39.660
We need to get you out,
Ms. Real.

1925
02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:41.704
-I'm not going anywhere.
-We're under attack, ma'am.

1926
02:28:41.787 --> 02:28:43.539
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1927
02:28:43.623 --> 02:28:45.708
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing,

1928
02:28:45.791 --> 02:28:46.792
but I'm not.

1929
02:28:46.876 --> 02:28:48.461
-Excuse me.
-Ma'am...

1930
02:28:53.549 --> 02:28:54.842
Everyone, everyone,

1931
02:28:54.925 --> 02:28:56.886
if I could just
get your attention.

1932
02:28:56.969 --> 02:28:59.472
Please!
I just need your attention!

1933
02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:16.447
You're okay!

1934
02:30:47.163 --> 02:30:49.832
Hey! Hey!
How do I get up there?

1935
02:30:49.915 --> 02:30:51.125
Follow me, sir.

1936
02:33:01.005 --> 02:33:02.506
No, no. It's okay.

1937
02:33:02.590 --> 02:33:03.674
It's okay.

1938
02:33:03.757 --> 02:33:05.926
-It's okay.

1939
02:33:07.469 --> 02:33:09.680
It's done now. It's done.

1940
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:13.684
It's over.

1941
02:34:08.948 --> 02:34:10.032
Hey!

1942
02:34:10.115 --> 02:34:12.743
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1943
02:34:12.826 --> 02:34:14.828
-Take it easy.

1944
02:34:14.912 --> 02:34:15.996
Easy.

1945
02:34:44.525 --> 02:34:45.651
Jesus.

1946
02:34:55.452 --> 02:34:57.162
Who the hell are you?

1947
02:35:01.375 --> 02:35:02.376
Me?

1948
02:35:05.504 --> 02:35:06.880
I'm Vengeance.

1949
02:38:39.468 --> 02:38:41.845
Wednesday,
November 6th.

1950
02:38:45.015 --> 02:38:46.975
The city is underwater.

1951
02:38:49.394 --> 02:38:51.271
The National Guard is coming.

1952
02:38:53.232 --> 02:38:56.485
Martial law is in effect,

1953
02:38:56.568 --> 02:38:58.403
but the criminal element
never sleeps.

1954
02:39:01.198 --> 02:39:04.910
Looting and lawlessness
will be rampant

1955
02:39:04.993 --> 02:39:08.622
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

1956
02:39:08.705 --> 02:39:11.250
I can already see
things will get worse

1957
02:39:11.333 --> 02:39:12.626
before they get better.

1958
02:39:15.337 --> 02:39:18.715
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

1959
02:39:20.008 --> 02:39:21.969
We will rebuild.

1960
02:39:22.052 --> 02:39:24.054
But not just our city.

1961
02:39:24.137 --> 02:39:26.515
We must rebuild people's faith

1962
02:39:26.598 --> 02:39:28.350
in our institutions,

1963
02:39:28.433 --> 02:39:30.560
in our elected officials,

1964
02:39:30.644 --> 02:39:32.479
in each other.

1965
02:39:32.563 --> 02:39:35.691
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1966
02:39:40.237 --> 02:39:42.114
I'm starting
to see now.

1967
02:39:43.448 --> 02:39:45.742
I have had an effect here...

1968
02:39:47.703 --> 02:39:49.746
but not the one I intended.

1969
02:39:51.957 --> 02:39:55.168
Vengeance
won't change the past,

1970
02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:58.880
mine or anyone else's.

1971
02:40:01.258 --> 02:40:03.343
I have to become more.

1972
02:40:06.346 --> 02:40:08.932
People need hope.

1973
02:40:09.016 --> 02:40:11.476
To know
someone's out there for them.

1974
02:40:15.147 --> 02:40:16.898
The city's angry,

1975
02:40:17.774 --> 02:40:19.192
scarred,

1976
02:40:20.068 --> 02:40:21.361
like me.

1977
02:40:23.363 --> 02:40:26.700
Our scars can destroy us.

1978
02:40:26.783 --> 02:40:29.661
Even after the physical wounds
have healed.

1979
02:40:31.204 --> 02:40:33.040
But if we survive them,

1980
02:40:34.458 --> 02:40:36.418
they can transform us.

1981
02:40:38.170 --> 02:40:40.213
They can give us the power

1982
02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:42.674
to endure...

1983
02:40:43.967 --> 02:40:46.178
and the strength to fight.

1984
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:50.891
We are live.
As you can see,

1985
02:40:50.974 --> 02:40:53.977
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden,

1986
02:40:54.061 --> 02:40:55.479
helping to save the lives

1987
02:40:55.562 --> 02:40:57.356
-of hundreds of victims.

1988
02:40:57.439 --> 02:40:58.899
And now as first responders

1989
02:40:58.982 --> 02:41:00.484
desperately scramble
to help the injured,

1990
02:41:00.567 --> 02:41:02.944
a mysterious masked man
emerges,

1991
02:41:03.028 --> 02:41:05.489
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

1992
02:41:05.572 --> 02:41:08.158
Isn't that just terrible?

1993
02:41:09.493 --> 02:41:11.244
Him...

1994
02:41:11.328 --> 02:41:15.707
raining on your parade
like that?

1995
02:41:20.045 --> 02:41:22.130
What is it they say?

1996
02:41:23.215 --> 02:41:25.467
"One day you're on top...

1997
02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:28.679
the next,

1998
02:41:30.013 --> 02:41:32.432
you're a clown."

1999
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:35.477
Well...

2000
02:41:37.062 --> 02:41:40.065
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

2001
02:41:42.317 --> 02:41:45.070
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

2002
02:41:46.321 --> 02:41:48.198
You did so well.

2003
02:41:52.661 --> 02:41:53.703
And you know,

2004
02:41:55.247 --> 02:41:58.583
Gotham loves a comeback story.

2005
02:42:08.552 --> 02:42:10.303
Who are you?

2006
02:42:10.387 --> 02:42:12.973
Well,
that's the question,

2007
02:42:14.182 --> 02:42:15.350
isn't it?

2008
02:42:18.437 --> 02:42:20.856
Riddle me this...

2009
02:42:23.066 --> 02:42:25.819
"The less of them you have,

2010
02:42:25.902 --> 02:42:29.823
the more one is worth."

2011
02:42:35.245 --> 02:42:36.997
A friend.

2012
02:43:03.565 --> 02:43:04.983
-You're leaving.

2013
02:43:05.066 --> 02:43:06.193
Jesus.

2014
02:43:07.986 --> 02:43:09.696
Don't you ever just say hello?

2015
02:43:14.576 --> 02:43:16.036
Where will you go?

2016
02:43:17.454 --> 02:43:20.248
I don't know. Upstate.

2017
02:43:20.332 --> 02:43:22.083
Bludhaven, maybe.

2018
02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:23.960
Why?

2019
02:43:25.086 --> 02:43:26.379
You asking me to stay?

2020
02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:35.680
You know this place
is never gonna change.

2021
02:43:35.764 --> 02:43:38.433
With Carmine gone, it's only
gonna get worse for you.

2022
02:43:38.517 --> 02:43:40.435
There's gonna be a power grab.

2023
02:43:41.853 --> 02:43:43.021
It'll be bloody.

2024
02:43:43.647 --> 02:43:44.856
I know.

2025
02:43:46.566 --> 02:43:47.817
But the city can change.

2026
02:43:47.901 --> 02:43:49.110
It won't.

2027
02:43:50.153 --> 02:43:51.488
I have to try.

2028
02:43:51.571 --> 02:43:53.031
It's gonna kill you
eventually. You know that.

2029
02:43:55.325 --> 02:43:56.451
Listen.

2030
02:43:58.828 --> 02:44:00.163
Why don't you come with me?

2031
02:44:01.039 --> 02:44:03.124
Get into some trouble.

2032
02:44:03.208 --> 02:44:05.085
Knock off some
CEO hedge fund types.

2033
02:44:05.168 --> 02:44:07.420
It'll be fun.

2034
02:44:07.504 --> 02:44:09.047
The bat and the cat.

2035
02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:12.342
It's got a nice ring.

2036
02:44:25.605 --> 02:44:27.023
Who am I kidding?

2037
02:44:28.441 --> 02:44:30.652
You're already spoken for.

2038
02:44:42.497 --> 02:44:43.873
You should go.

2039
02:44:52.299 --> 02:44:53.300
Selina...

2040
02:44:57.304 --> 02:44:59.055
Take care of yourself.
