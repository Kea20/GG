Hey! Hola, amigo.

21
00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.334
Good to see you again.

22
00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:41.906
Papa, he stepped on my face!

23
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.307

-Good night.
-Puss in Boots!

Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!
Puss in Boots...


108
00:08:30.254 --> 00:08:31.922
You're still here?

109
00:08:33.124 --> 00:08:34.925
Okay, okay.

110
00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:35.960
One more number.

111
00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:39.396
I call this one
"The Legend Will Never Die..."


112
00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:44.235
Puss in Boots!

113
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:50.141
Puss? Puss.

114
00:08:50.174 --> 00:08:51.442
Puss in Boots.

115
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:59.717
Uh, where am I?

116
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.019
Not to worry.
You're in good hands.


117
00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:03.387
My hands!

118
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.756
I am the village doctor.

119
00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:07.358
I am also the village barber,
veterinarian,


120
00:09:07.391 --> 00:09:09.126
dentist and witchfinder.

121
00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:13.764
And in my professional opinion,
you need a wash,


122
00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:16.167
a blowout and a little trim
around the hindquarters.


123
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.434
Uh...

124
00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:19.170
That's my professional
barber opinion.


125
00:09:19.203 --> 00:09:21.438
But, putting on my doctor's hat,

126
00:09:21.472 --> 00:09:24.175
I think we need to run
a few tests.


127
00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.377
All right. Reflexes.

128
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.345
Catlike.

129
00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:30.047
Temperature.

130
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.316
Now lift your tail and relax.

131
00:09:32.349 --> 00:09:35.986
Trust me, I run hot. Yep.

132
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.789
Then how about the latest
in modern medical technology?


133
00:09:38.822 --> 00:09:40.291
Leeches!

134
00:09:40.324 --> 00:09:42.293
To draw out the evil humors.

135
00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:45.296
Suit yourself. More for me.

136
00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:46.997
Uh, listen, Doctor.

137
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:50.234
Thanks for everything, you know,
but I am feeling great.


138
00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:52.937
Strong, like a bull! You know?

139
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.207
Now, do you know a good place
to get some gazpacho?


140
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.075
Please. This is serious.

141
00:09:58.108 --> 00:09:59.310
What is it?

142
00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:02.246
Puss in Boots,
how do I say this?


143
00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:06.217
You died.

144
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:10.187
Doctor, please.

145
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:12.823
Relax! I am Puss in Boots.

146
00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:14.825
I laugh at death.

147
00:10:14.858 --> 00:10:17.228
You see?

148
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:19.096
And anyway, I am a cat.

149
00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:20.931
I have nine lives.

150
00:10:20.965 --> 00:10:23.234
And how many times
have you died already?


151
00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:26.036
Uh... I don't know.

152
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.137
I never counted.

153
00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:29.306
I am not really a math guy,
you know?


154
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.475
<i>-Gato.</i>
-Take it easy, Doctor.


155
00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:33.844
Let's see, uh...

156
00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:36.313
There was the running
of the bulls in Pamplona.


157
00:10:38.349 --> 00:10:40.517
Hola, señorita.

158
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:42.753
Do you like gazpacho?

159
00:10:43.988 --> 00:10:47.324
Guess it's not
your night, huh, fellas?


160
00:10:50.427 --> 00:10:51.929
I am telling you,

161
00:10:51.962 --> 00:10:54.131
a cat always lands on his feet.

162
00:10:54.164 --> 00:10:55.766
Watch.

163
00:10:59.203 --> 00:11:02.239
No. Puss in Boots
doesn't need a spotter.


164
00:11:02.273 --> 00:11:04.275
Watch.

165
00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:07.411
No need to pull into port.

166
00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:09.413
This will revolutionize travel.

167
00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:10.981
Watch.

168
00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:15.219
Uh, excuse me.
Does this have shellfish in it?


169
00:11:15.252 --> 00:11:16.420
Yes, sir.

170
00:11:16.453 --> 00:11:17.588
Eh.

171
00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:21.558
Puss, I think you set
the oven too high.


172
00:11:21.592 --> 00:11:24.161
I am a master of the baking.
Watch.


173
00:11:26.563 --> 00:11:28.365
And then there was
the giant today.


174
00:11:29.634 --> 00:11:32.970
So, what is that?
Like, uh, uh, four?


175
00:11:33.003 --> 00:11:35.039
That makes eight, Puss.

176
00:11:35.072 --> 00:11:36.907
You are down to your last life.

177
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.843
My prescription:
no more adventures for you.


178
00:11:39.877 --> 00:11:41.412
You need to retire.

179
00:11:41.445 --> 00:11:43.213
Me? Retire?

180
00:11:43.247 --> 00:11:45.149
Are you
the village comedian as well?


181
00:11:45.182 --> 00:11:48.152
Puss, is there any safe place
you can go?


182
00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:50.354
Any special someone
you can rely on


183
00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:52.222
in this moment of need?

184
00:11:52.256 --> 00:11:56.427
I am Puss in Boots,
loved by one and all.


185
00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.028
Anyone in particular?

186
00:11:58.062 --> 00:12:02.266
I mean, uh,
how could I possibly choose?


187
00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:03.934
Mm-hmm.

188
00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:05.969
This is the address
of Mama Luna.


189
00:12:06.003 --> 00:12:07.938
She is a cat fancier,

190
00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:09.606
always on the lookout
for a new lap cat.


191
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:11.875
-You will be safe there.
-Lap cat?


192
00:12:11.909 --> 00:12:13.610
I am no lap cat, Doctor.

193
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.213
I am Puss in Boots!

194
00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:17.581
Not anymore.

195
00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:18.882
Barber's orders.

196
00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:20.951
I mean, doctor's orders.

197
00:12:20.984 --> 00:12:25.623
And remember, Puss,
death comes for us all.


198
00:12:25.657 --> 00:12:27.191
Treat?

199
00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:30.294
You've really got to work
on your bedside manner.


200
00:12:41.706 --> 00:12:44.375
I am Puss in Boots.

201
00:12:44.408 --> 00:12:46.410
I am no one's lap cat.

202
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:50.381
That doctor is a quack
and a crazy man.


203
00:12:50.414 --> 00:12:52.049
He should stick to cutting hair.

204
00:12:52.082 --> 00:12:53.984
Last call, Señor Boots.

205
00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:56.253
Another glass of cream.
Make it your heaviest.


206
00:12:56.286 --> 00:12:59.423
Oh, I keep the heavy stuff
in the back.


207
00:13:03.093 --> 00:13:05.562
"Retire."

208
00:13:05.596 --> 00:13:08.365
You are too good-looking
to retire.


209
00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:22.045
Well, well.

210
00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:24.649
If it isn't
Puss in Boots himself.


211
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.252
In the flesh.

212
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:31.121
Uh, hey.

213
00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:34.692
There's the famous hat,
the feather


214
00:13:34.726 --> 00:13:38.562
and, of course, the boots.

215
00:13:38.595 --> 00:13:40.632
My compliments to your cobbler.

216
00:13:42.132 --> 00:13:44.034
Thanks.

217
00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:47.271
Uh, good to meet you, too.

218
00:13:48.605 --> 00:13:53.177
Hey. I never do this,
but can I get your autograph?


219
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.214
Been following you
for a long time.


220
00:13:58.348 --> 00:14:00.217
Sign right there.

221
00:14:03.554 --> 00:14:06.457
Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death,


222
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.358
bounty hunter.

223
00:14:08.392 --> 00:14:10.260
So I've heard.

224
00:14:10.294 --> 00:14:13.464
You will find your reward
does not come easily.


225
00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:16.099
This I tell you.

226
00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:19.771
Everyone thinks they'll be
the one to defeat me,


227
00:14:19.804 --> 00:14:22.339
but no one's escaped me yet.

228
00:14:22.372 --> 00:14:23.741
All right.

229
00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.509
Let's get it over with.

230
00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:27.978
Fear me, if you da...

231
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:37.354
Okay, no more messing around.

232
00:14:40.692 --> 00:14:43.628
Slow. Sloppy. Sad.

233
00:14:56.708 --> 00:15:00.043
You're not
living up to the legend, <i>gato.</i>


234
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.147
I just love the smell of fear.

235
00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:50.695
What's the matter?

236
00:15:50.728 --> 00:15:53.597
Lives flashing before your eyes?

237
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.334
Pick it up.

238
00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:00.470
Pick it up.

We are gathered here today

252
00:17:40.938 --> 00:17:44.676
to say goodbye to Puss in Boots.

253
00:17:44.709 --> 00:17:48.412
There are no words
to express such a loss.


254
00:17:49.246 --> 00:17:51.214
Thank you.

255
00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:57.622
But it would be a crime
not to try.


256
00:17:57.655 --> 00:18:00.557
He was known across the land
by many names.


257
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.859
The Stabby Tabby.

263
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.706
I was right.

264
00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:17.207
Words were not enough.

265
00:18:19.677 --> 00:18:21.713

there are no cats here!

272
00:19:02.352 --> 00:19:04.055

00:19:13.064 --> 00:19:15.032
No, you're not.

What? Did I say something salty?

295
00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:00.812
It's my second language.

296
00:20:00.845 --> 00:20:03.014

00:22:35.032 --> 00:22:37.567

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.103
Oh, not a problem.

333
00:22:39.136 --> 00:22:41.105
We can eat and talk
at the same time.

<i>!Ah! ¿De dónde eres?</i>
<i>¿Te gustan las siestas?</i>


337
00:22:46.777 --> 00:22:49.113
I don't speak Spanish, either.

338
00:22:49.146 --> 00:22:50.715
You're funny.

339
00:22:50.748 --> 00:22:53.250
-Uh... okay. Good talk.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.


340
00:22:53.284 --> 00:22:55.820
Pickles? Is that your name?

341
00:22:55.853 --> 00:22:58.555
Me, I don't have a name
or a home.


342
00:23:00.925 --> 00:23:03.995
So, I'm no expert, but you
don't look like a Pickles.


343
00:23:04.028 --> 00:23:06.230
Well, you don't look like a cat.

344
00:23:06.263 --> 00:23:08.265
Okay, okay, okay.

345
00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:10.668
Full disclosure: I'm not a cat.

346
00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:13.004
-I'm a dog.
-Hi, Bon Bon.


347
00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:14.604
Meow.

348
00:23:14.638 --> 00:23:18.743
Oh, Pickles has
a new girlfriend? Okay.


349
00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:20.177
I live under the porch.

350
00:23:20.211 --> 00:23:21.879
It can get a little lonely
down there.


351
00:23:21.912 --> 00:23:24.015
It's mostly controlled by
the rats and the centipedes,


352
00:23:24.048 --> 00:23:25.616
but I have my own little corner.

353
00:23:25.649 --> 00:23:27.018
Congratulations.

354
00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:28.953
I just come up here
for the food and the friends.


355
00:23:28.986 --> 00:23:31.288
Mostly... mostly the food.

356
00:23:31.322 --> 00:23:33.791
Please don't tell anyone.
I need this.


357
00:23:33.824 --> 00:23:35.960
I won't tell. I don't care.

358
00:23:35.993 --> 00:23:37.560
So you'll keep my secret?

359
00:23:37.594 --> 00:23:39.096
A secret between friends?

360
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.865
Just a secret.

361
00:23:40.898 --> 00:23:43.167
It's funny-- despite all this
best friend bonding,


362
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.169
you're still a mystery to me,
Pickles.


363
00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:46.804
What's your story?

364
00:23:46.837 --> 00:23:48.039
My story...

365
00:23:50.174 --> 00:23:51.909
What are we looking at?

366
00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:55.179
...is over.

367
00:23:55.212 --> 00:23:57.081
Oh, no.

368
00:23:57.114 --> 00:23:59.116
Want to rub my belly?

369
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.785
Hmm?

370
00:24:00.818 --> 00:24:02.286
What-what's happening?

371
00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:04.188
-Rub.
-Hard pass.


372
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.323
Come on, rub.
I need the practice.


373
00:24:06.357 --> 00:24:08.192
I'm gonna be
a therapy dog someday.


374
00:24:08.225 --> 00:24:09.660
What the hell are you
talking about?


375
00:24:09.693 --> 00:24:11.028
I'm glad you asked.

376
00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:13.064
When people feel bad,
they can rub my belly.


377
00:24:13.097 --> 00:24:15.199
It'll make 'em feel better.
Rub my belly.


378
00:24:15.232 --> 00:24:16.700
-No. No.
-Come on, rub it.


379
00:24:16.734 --> 00:24:18.202
-Not happening. No.
-Rub it.


380
00:24:18.235 --> 00:24:19.670
Let me be clear.

381
00:24:19.703 --> 00:24:22.339
I don't want to touch
your belly, okay?


382
00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:24.975
Okey doke.
So, what do you want?


383
00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:28.646
I want to be left alone.

384
00:24:48.732 --> 00:24:51.068
Ugh, you're back.

385
00:24:51.102 --> 00:24:53.037
Oh, I never left.

386
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.885
The wolf. He found me.

387
00:25:18.429 --> 00:25:20.364
Hello, missus.

388
00:25:20.397 --> 00:25:22.066
We're looking for a cat.

389
00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:23.334
This cat.

390
00:25:23.367 --> 00:25:25.169
We've got an offer for him.

391
00:25:25.202 --> 00:25:28.072
What could they possibly want
to offer Puss in Boots?


392
00:25:28.105 --> 00:25:31.008
-What's a Puss in Boots?
-Seriously?


393
00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:32.343
I told you
health department people,


394
00:25:32.376 --> 00:25:33.744
there are no cats here.

395
00:25:33.777 --> 00:25:35.880
Make her talk.

396
00:25:38.182 --> 00:25:39.783
Excuse me, my darling.

397
00:25:39.817 --> 00:25:42.153
We're looking for
the legendary Puss in Boots.


398
00:25:42.186 --> 00:25:44.421
Have you perhaps... seen him?

399
00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:45.823
Too soft.

400
00:25:45.856 --> 00:25:47.091
Out with it, you old biddy,

401
00:25:47.124 --> 00:25:49.226
or I'll have your guts
for garters.


402
00:25:51.262 --> 00:25:54.431
Too hard.
That was not just right.


403
00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:56.700
Oi, Baby, sniff him out.

404
00:25:56.734 --> 00:25:58.435
You don't tell me what to do.

405
00:25:58.469 --> 00:25:59.703
Listen to your sister, Baby.

406
00:25:59.737 --> 00:26:01.205
Oh, she's not my sister!

407
00:26:01.238 --> 00:26:02.840
She's a fugitive orphan.

408
00:26:02.873 --> 00:26:04.241
-Ow!
-She is your sister.


409
00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:05.476
Do as she says.

410
00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:09.046
Fine, but all I can smell
is cats' pee.


411
00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:10.814
Everybody!

412
00:26:10.848 --> 00:26:12.816
Get to the safe room,
just like we practiced!


413
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.718
Oi. She's leggin' it.

414
00:26:14.752 --> 00:26:16.787
Follow me, children! Ow!

415
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.923
Give her the piano
treatment, Papa.


416
00:26:18.956 --> 00:26:21.192
Oh! You think this is
the first time


417
00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:23.093
I've been stuffed in a piano?

418
00:26:24.895 --> 00:26:26.830
Here we go!

419
00:26:27.898 --> 00:26:30.367
♪ Roll out the barrel... ♪

420
00:26:30.401 --> 00:26:33.137
-Oh...
-Mama, focus, please.


421
00:26:38.242 --> 00:26:40.511
Hey! There's cats everywhere!

422
00:26:40.544 --> 00:26:43.247
So many cats!

423
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.815
Amateurs.

424
00:26:45.449 --> 00:26:47.751
I'll be outside.

425
00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:49.486
My cats can play
better than you.


426
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.522
♪ Now's the time
to roll out the barrel... ♪


427
00:26:51.555 --> 00:26:53.490
Goldi, is this him?

428
00:26:53.524 --> 00:26:55.226
That's a dog in a cat costume.

429
00:26:55.259 --> 00:26:56.860
Oh, yeah.

430
00:26:56.894 --> 00:26:58.362
Tricky little bugger.

431
00:26:58.395 --> 00:27:00.264
How about this one?
He's a ginger.


432
00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:04.134
Is that a joke?

433
00:27:04.168 --> 00:27:07.238
You think this scruffy,
geriatric bag of bones


434
00:27:07.271 --> 00:27:08.973
looks like a legend?

435
00:27:09.006 --> 00:27:10.374
This is definitely not...

436
00:27:10.407 --> 00:27:12.810
Puss in Boots! I found him!

437
00:27:13.544 --> 00:27:16.880
Puss in Boots, dead and buried.

438
00:27:16.914 --> 00:27:18.983
Dead? No, no, no, he can't be.

439
00:27:19.016 --> 00:27:21.785
Yep. The nose never lies.

440
00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:23.387
Well, that's that, then.

441
00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.122
What say we go
and hibernate, huh?


442
00:27:25.155 --> 00:27:26.390
-No.
-Ow!


443
00:27:26.423 --> 00:27:28.125
The map is being
delivered tonight,


444
00:27:28.158 --> 00:27:30.060
and we have one chance
to steal it.


445
00:27:30.094 --> 00:27:32.296
Without it, we'll never find
the Wishing Star.


446
00:27:32.329 --> 00:27:34.164
The Wishing Star.

447
00:27:34.198 --> 00:27:35.899
It does exist.

448
00:27:35.933 --> 00:27:38.135
That star has one wish to grant.

449
00:27:38.168 --> 00:27:39.436
One wish?

450
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.472
Think of what
that could mean for us.


451
00:27:41.505 --> 00:27:43.841
Nine lives. Yes!

452
00:27:43.874 --> 00:27:45.542
Well, I don't see
why we needed to hire


453
00:27:45.576 --> 00:27:47.211
Puss in Boots
in the first place.


454
00:27:47.244 --> 00:27:51.215
Ugh. Because nobody steals
from Big Jack Horner.


455
00:27:51.248 --> 00:27:53.183
No! Not Jack Horner.

456
00:27:53.217 --> 00:27:56.353
Don't worry, love.
We'll get that wish somehow.


457
00:27:56.387 --> 00:27:57.821
Thank you, Mama.

458
00:27:57.855 --> 00:28:00.157
Yeah, because I've got a plan.

459
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.493
I can nick a map
as good as any old cat.


460
00:28:04.194 --> 00:28:06.063
You've got a plan?

461
00:28:06.096 --> 00:28:08.232
What? I'm smart, ain't I?
Ain't I, Papa?


462
00:28:08.265 --> 00:28:11.902
No, you ain't
well-fixed for brains.


463
00:28:11.935 --> 00:28:15.506
Robbing Big Jack Horner--
very risky.


464
00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:18.575
But that wish could get me
my lives back.


465
00:28:18.609 --> 00:28:20.577
And my life back.

466
00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:22.446
Goodbye, Pickles!

467
00:28:22.479 --> 00:28:24.048
Oh, no, Pickles, you're leaving?

468
00:28:24.081 --> 00:28:26.150
<i>Perro,</i> start digging.

469
00:28:26.183 --> 00:28:27.885
Okay.

470
00:28:27.918 --> 00:28:30.020
But if this Puss in Boots
is such a big deal,


471
00:28:30.054 --> 00:28:31.855
maybe we shouldn't be
desecrating his grave.


472
00:28:31.889 --> 00:28:36.160
No, I don't think he would mind,
because he...


473
00:28:38.228 --> 00:28:40.331
...is me!

474
00:28:40.364 --> 00:28:43.467
Oh. O
-Okay.

475
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.369
Oh, yeah. Uh...

476
00:28:45.402 --> 00:28:47.071
Normally, I have a sword.

477
00:28:47.104 --> 00:28:48.906
It's like a whole thing,
you know?


478
00:28:48.939 --> 00:28:50.642
Pickles, you're Puss in Boots?

479
00:28:50.675 --> 00:28:52.476
Not yet, but I will be.

480
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:53.944
I'll come...

481
00:28:53.977 --> 00:28:55.946
-I'll come with you.
-Sorry, <i>perro.</i>


482
00:28:55.979 --> 00:28:58.549
Puss in Boots walks alone!

483
00:29:05.623 --> 00:29:08.025
Open the gates!

484
00:29:19.002 --> 00:29:20.638
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

485
00:29:20.672 --> 00:29:23.607
Hands off the merchandise.
We got this.


486
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:26.110
Okay. Just get in and get out.

487
00:29:26.143 --> 00:29:28.545
-Easy peasy.
-Lemon squeezy.


488
00:29:28.579 --> 00:29:30.414
Aah! What are you doing here?

489
00:29:30.447 --> 00:29:32.049
I brought you a sword.

490
00:29:32.082 --> 00:29:34.017
That's not a sword.
That's a stick.


491
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:36.053
-It's a stick sword.
-Go home.


492
00:29:36.086 --> 00:29:37.655
Well, my home is where
my friends are.


493
00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:39.390
Again, not friends.

494
00:29:39.423 --> 00:29:40.658
Rub for luck?

495
00:29:40.692 --> 00:29:43.127
I don't need luck for this.

496
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.529
I am a highly skilled
master cat thief.


497
00:29:45.562 --> 00:29:47.364
Watch.

498
00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:52.269
You got this.

499
00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:10.087
Hmm.

500
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.925
I pronounce this batch...
delicious.


501
00:30:17.695 --> 00:30:19.496
Ship 'em out.

502
00:30:20.564 --> 00:30:22.599
Mr. Horner.

503
00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:25.135
The Serpent Sisters
got the goods.


504
00:30:25.169 --> 00:30:29.206
Is it? Is it the map
to the Wishing Star?


505
00:30:29.239 --> 00:30:32.042
Stop everything.
You two, come with me.


506
00:30:32.075 --> 00:30:33.577
We must get this
to the trophy room.


507
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.281
You know, it took a lot
of murdering to get this map.


508
00:30:37.314 --> 00:30:38.582
It all started...

509
00:30:38.616 --> 00:30:40.517
Take it to the trophy room!

510
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.131
What the...

511
00:30:54.164 --> 00:30:57.034
Wow. Look at all
the magic stuff.


512
00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:59.036
Yes, I collect
enchanted objects,


513
00:30:59.069 --> 00:31:01.104
magical icons,
bobbles and geegaws


514
00:31:01.138 --> 00:31:03.373
and la-di-da and blah-blah-blah.

515
00:31:03.407 --> 00:31:06.343
Check it out.
I'm walking on a magic carpet.


516
00:31:06.376 --> 00:31:08.045
Sweet.

517
00:31:08.078 --> 00:31:10.013
The shrunken ship
of the Lilliputians.


518
00:31:10.047 --> 00:31:13.050
Shut up!
Are those unicorn horns?


519
00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:14.752
Baby unicorn horns.

520
00:31:14.786 --> 00:31:17.087
Half as heavy, twice as sharp.

521
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.490
-Savage.
-They're trinkets.


522
00:31:19.523 --> 00:31:21.693
They're nothing compared
to the awesome power


523
00:31:21.726 --> 00:31:23.260
of the magic Wishing Star.

524
00:31:23.293 --> 00:31:25.596
Speaking of which,
make with the box, sister.


525
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:26.731
You got it, boss.

526
00:31:26.764 --> 00:31:28.633
Like I was saying,

527
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.501
the amount of murdering we...

528
00:31:30.534 --> 00:31:32.369
Make with the box!

529
00:31:32.402 --> 00:31:36.373
After so many years
of searching,


530
00:31:36.406 --> 00:31:38.308
this is my moment.

531
00:31:38.342 --> 00:31:42.747
With this wish,
I will finally be


532
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.115
the master of all magic.

533
00:31:45.148 --> 00:31:47.117
Hey, Little Jack.

534
00:31:49.086 --> 00:31:50.287
Excuse me?

535
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.723
-Could you do the thumb thing?
-Shh.


536
00:31:51.756 --> 00:31:53.190
Like in the fairy tale?

537
00:31:53.223 --> 00:31:54.726
It wasn't a fairy tale!

538
00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:56.360
It was only a nursery rhyme.

539
00:31:56.393 --> 00:31:58.796
Oh, yeah. The lame one.

540
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.164
Little Jack Horner
sat in the corner


541
00:32:01.198 --> 00:32:03.166
eating a Horner pie...

542
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.369
♪ Stuck in my thumb,
pulled out a plum ♪


543
00:32:05.402 --> 00:32:09.406
♪ And said,
"What a good boy am I." ♪


544
00:32:10.574 --> 00:32:11.843
Look! A magic puppet.

545
00:32:11.876 --> 00:32:13.745
♪ 'Cause I'm a real boy ♪

546
00:32:13.778 --> 00:32:15.445
♪ No strings attached. ♪

547
00:32:15.479 --> 00:32:17.615
Thank you. Thank you.

548
00:32:17.649 --> 00:32:19.116
What's impressive?

549
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:21.451
I've been a boy the whole time.

550
00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:26.123
Little Jack Horner
didn't have any magic.


551
00:32:26.156 --> 00:32:30.594
He was a pathetic,
buttered baker's boy.


552
00:32:30.628 --> 00:32:32.864
Little Jack's dead!

553
00:32:32.897 --> 00:32:34.766
I'm Big Jack Horner.

554
00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:38.468
Uh, Mr. Big Jack Horner, sir...

555
00:32:38.502 --> 00:32:41.104
-I barely know her.
-What do you mean?


556
00:32:41.138 --> 00:32:43.808
We're sisters, you goof.

557
00:32:43.841 --> 00:32:45.677
We got matching face tattoos.

558
00:32:46.678 --> 00:32:49.681
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

559
00:32:51.749 --> 00:32:53.584
-Puss?
-Kitty?


560
00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:55.687
-Puss...
-Kitty!


561
00:33:00.758 --> 00:33:02.392
This is my job.

562
00:33:02.426 --> 00:33:05.329
No, this is my job.
I'm double-crossing the bears.


563
00:33:05.362 --> 00:33:07.164
No, I am double-crossing
the bears.


564
00:33:07.197 --> 00:33:09.199
They tried to hire me
earlier today.


565
00:33:09.232 --> 00:33:11.134
Well, they tried to hire me
two weeks ago.


566
00:33:11.168 --> 00:33:12.904
That makes you plan B.

567
00:33:12.937 --> 00:33:14.338
Aha!

568
00:33:14.371 --> 00:33:16.841
-There it is.
-Whew.


569
00:33:16.874 --> 00:33:18.542
Now, about your payment.

570
00:33:18.575 --> 00:33:22.614
Hold up. You promised us
our weight in gold.


571
00:33:22.647 --> 00:33:24.147
I did, didn't I?

572
00:33:24.181 --> 00:33:25.917
Ever hear of the Midas touch?

573
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.552
Ah, cool. Dibs.

574
00:33:28.585 --> 00:33:31.455
Oh, no.
I misjudged the situation.


575
00:33:32.657 --> 00:33:34.591
This is why you don't cross
Jack Horner.


576
00:33:34.626 --> 00:33:35.760
What is this?

577
00:33:35.793 --> 00:33:37.361
-Are you a pirate now?
-Shh.


578
00:33:37.394 --> 00:33:40.297
It's like a possum crawled
on your face and died.


579
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.532
-Shh!
-Of shame.


580
00:33:42.566 --> 00:33:44.301
Please, mock me quietly.

581
00:33:44.334 --> 00:33:46.203
I hate it. It's disgusting.

582
00:33:46.236 --> 00:33:48.605
Well, I love it.
It's distinguished.


583
00:33:56.446 --> 00:34:00.618
Great plan, Baby. Real catlike.

584
00:34:05.857 --> 00:34:08.660
Uh, can I go?

585
00:34:08.693 --> 00:34:10.728
Pleasure doing, uh...

586
00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.399
-Puss in Boots?
-Goldi. Bears.


587
00:34:15.432 --> 00:34:17.935
-Hola, Jack.
-Kitty Softpaws.


588
00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:21.438
My, you have a lot of nerve
coming back here.


589
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:23.841
Please. I was the best thief
you ever hired.


590
00:34:23.875 --> 00:34:25.677
-You robbed me.
-You set me up.


591
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.813
You said you were going
on some spiritual retreat.


592
00:34:28.846 --> 00:34:29.947
Namaste.

593
00:34:29.981 --> 00:34:31.749
And you're supposed to be dead.

594
00:34:31.783 --> 00:34:32.984
I got better?

595
00:34:33.017 --> 00:34:34.418
Ugh. Just give us the map.

596
00:34:34.451 --> 00:34:35.953
-And throw in a dozen pies.
-Eh?


597
00:34:35.987 --> 00:34:37.454
Ooh. Have you got
any savory pies?


598
00:34:37.487 --> 00:34:39.322
-What? N-No.
-Yeah, what flavors you got?


599
00:34:39.356 --> 00:34:40.825
Can we get all of that
in a bag to go?


600
00:34:40.858 --> 00:34:43.995
Oh, would you stop talking
about blooming pies? Focus!


601
00:34:44.028 --> 00:34:45.830
Hand over that map,

602
00:34:45.863 --> 00:34:47.765
or I'll punch holes
in the lot of ya.


603
00:34:49.033 --> 00:34:52.436
-Oh, bums.
-Look out! It's coming down!


604
00:34:55.605 --> 00:34:56.841
Ha!

605
00:34:56.874 --> 00:35:01.012
I hate talking
fairy tale animals!


606
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:06.718
What? Get back here!

607
00:35:06.751 --> 00:35:08.485
The best thief has won.

608
00:35:08.518 --> 00:35:10.021
-Huh?
-You're right.


609
00:35:10.054 --> 00:35:12.255
She did.

610
00:35:12.289 --> 00:35:13.356
Oh, come on!

611
00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:16.593
There. They're getting away.

612
00:35:24.902 --> 00:35:27.337
Ooh.

613
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.606
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!


614
00:35:30.908 --> 00:35:32.877
Nice catching up with you, Puss.

615
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.812
Got to go.

616
00:35:35.913 --> 00:35:38.348
Here, kitty, kitty.

617
00:35:39.617 --> 00:35:41.853
Is that a stick? What are you
gonna do with that...


618
00:35:41.886 --> 00:35:44.321
-Ow!
-Ow! Me knuckles!


619
00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:46.758
You shouldn't have
done that, mate.


620
00:35:49.994 --> 00:35:51.495
This idiot.

621
00:35:56.667 --> 00:35:58.903
Hey, Puss.
I found a sandwich in here.


622
00:35:58.936 --> 00:36:00.037
I think it's tuna fish.

623
00:36:00.071 --> 00:36:01.438
-Drive, <i>perro!</i>
-Okey doke.


624
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.049
Oh, cool.
Another member of the team.


625
00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:13.350
We are not a team.

626
00:36:13.383 --> 00:36:14.786
-Eyes on the road!
-Whoa!


627
00:36:14.819 --> 00:36:15.987
Who is this guy?

628
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.989
-I'm Puss's best friend.
-No, he isn't.


629
00:36:18.022 --> 00:36:19.356
And his therapy dog.

630
00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:20.758
Definitely not.

631
00:36:20.792 --> 00:36:23.293
Finally. You need therapy.

632
00:36:25.997 --> 00:36:27.531
Give me the map. Trust me.

633
00:36:27.564 --> 00:36:30.701
Trust you?
Like I did in Santa Coloma?


634
00:36:30.735 --> 00:36:31.903
Really? Santa Coloma?

635
00:36:31.936 --> 00:36:34.304
<i>Sí,</i> Santa Coloma.

636
00:36:37.374 --> 00:36:38.709
-Mine!
-Mine!


637
00:36:38.743 --> 00:36:39.977
-Mine!
-Mine!


638
00:36:47.718 --> 00:36:48.820
Hyah!

639
00:36:55.726 --> 00:36:58.428
Good people,
accept this golden gift


640
00:36:58.461 --> 00:37:00.832
from Puss in Boots!

641
00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:15.445
Speed up! Go, go, go!

642
00:37:18.415 --> 00:37:22.352
Assemble the Baker's Dozen.

643
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.989
Careful with this.

644
00:37:25.022 --> 00:37:27.390
I'll take this and that.

645
00:37:27.424 --> 00:37:28.726
Oh, and these. One of those.

646
00:37:28.759 --> 00:37:31.028
And I got to take that.
Yes. Yes.


647
00:37:31.062 --> 00:37:34.131
No. Yes! Oh, yeah!

648
00:37:37.434 --> 00:37:39.003
All of these!

649
00:37:39.036 --> 00:37:42.372
This one is right.

650
00:37:54.517 --> 00:37:59.690
I'll get you, my kitties,
and your little dog, too.


651
00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:07.765
What? This is blank.

652
00:38:07.798 --> 00:38:10.500
We've been ripped off!
Where is the...


653
00:38:10.533 --> 00:38:13.503
Oh. Yeah.
I knew it was gonna do that.


654
00:38:13.536 --> 00:38:16.173
"The Dark Forest
is deep and far.


655
00:38:16.207 --> 00:38:19.143
Within its bounds,
you'll find the star."


656
00:38:19.176 --> 00:38:21.712
The Dark Forest?

657
00:38:21.746 --> 00:38:24.081
No one goes
into the Dark Forest.


658
00:38:24.115 --> 00:38:25.850
Or comes out.

659
00:38:25.883 --> 00:38:28.585
"A single wish
burns true and bright.


660
00:38:28.619 --> 00:38:31.789
This map's the key,
so hold on tight."


661
00:38:32.957 --> 00:38:34.557
<i>Suéltalo.</i>

662
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:36.694
-You let go.
-A stick?


663
00:38:36.727 --> 00:38:39.063
What happened to your sword?

664
00:38:39.096 --> 00:38:40.497
Got rid of it, you know.

665
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:41.933
Made things too easy.

666
00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:43.533
I needed a challenge.

667
00:38:43.566 --> 00:38:45.903
Yeah, you looked
pretty challenged back there.


668
00:38:47.271 --> 00:38:49.073
There's no way I'm letting you
hold the map.


669
00:38:49.106 --> 00:38:51.242
Well, there's no way
I'm letting you hold the map.


670
00:38:51.275 --> 00:38:53.711
I can hold it.

671
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:56.681
Yeah, right.
What's your deal, anyway?


672
00:38:56.714 --> 00:38:58.548
You run with the Chihuahua Gang?

673
00:38:58.581 --> 00:38:59.750
I don't think so.

674
00:38:59.784 --> 00:39:01.584
-I don't believe you.
-That's okay.


675
00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:03.854
As long as you believe
in yourself.


676
00:39:03.888 --> 00:39:05.122
Wha...

677
00:39:05.156 --> 00:39:07.490
Is he deranged?

678
00:39:07.524 --> 00:39:09.160
-Yep.
-What's your name?


679
00:39:09.193 --> 00:39:11.494
Oh, I've been called
all kinds of things.


680
00:39:11.528 --> 00:39:13.030
Dog, Bad Dog, Stupid Dog.

681
00:39:13.064 --> 00:39:16.100
Hey You! You There! Get Out!
Leave It! Drop It!


682
00:39:16.133 --> 00:39:18.535
Big Rat, Small Pig, Rat Face,

683
00:39:18.568 --> 00:39:20.004
Butt Nugget, (bleep) for Brains.

684
00:39:20.037 --> 00:39:21.672
You know, that sort of thing.

685
00:39:21.706 --> 00:39:24.241
But I've never had a name
that really stuck, you know?


686
00:39:24.275 --> 00:39:26.210
That belonged to me.

687
00:39:26.243 --> 00:39:28.879
-Is he done?
-And you are?


688
00:39:28.913 --> 00:39:30.147
Softpaws.

689
00:39:30.181 --> 00:39:31.749
Kitty Softpaws.

690
00:39:31.782 --> 00:39:34.151
Wow. Yeah.
Now, that's a good name.


691
00:39:34.185 --> 00:39:35.953
There's music
in a name like that.


692
00:39:35.987 --> 00:39:38.521
Kitty Softpaws.

693
00:39:38.555 --> 00:39:41.258
Nice try. Classic con.

694
00:39:41.292 --> 00:39:43.961
No one's that dumb.
No one's that nice.


695
00:39:43.995 --> 00:39:45.229
I don't trust you.

696
00:39:45.262 --> 00:39:47.597
Me, neither.
He cannot be trusted.


697
00:39:47.631 --> 00:39:50.835
But I trust him
more than I trust you.


698
00:39:50.868 --> 00:39:54.005
Wow.
This trip is going to be fun.


699
00:40:27.604 --> 00:40:30.775
This must be the Dark Forest.

700
00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:42.253
Oh, my God!

701
00:40:42.286 --> 00:40:43.788
It's gone.

702
00:40:43.821 --> 00:40:44.922
It's back.

703
00:40:44.955 --> 00:40:46.190
<i>Ay, qué miedo.</i>

704
00:40:46.223 --> 00:40:49.060
Nothing to worry about.

705
00:40:49.093 --> 00:40:50.995
We step through as one.

706
00:40:51.028 --> 00:40:52.063
Ready?

707
00:40:52.096 --> 00:40:53.998
One, two, after you.

708
00:40:54.031 --> 00:40:56.133
Wait, what?

709
00:40:58.169 --> 00:41:00.304
Dog? Still alive?

710
00:41:00.337 --> 00:41:02.106
-Let's go find out.
-Wait!


711
00:41:10.247 --> 00:41:12.116
Um...

712
00:41:13.284 --> 00:41:16.220
-Whoa.
-Wow.


713
00:41:16.253 --> 00:41:20.858
For a Dark Forest,
this place is pretty colorful.


714
00:41:20.891 --> 00:41:22.960
I wish I had
my quinceañera here.


715
00:41:22.993 --> 00:41:26.097
The Wishing Star is
in here somewhere.


716
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.033
Kitty, may I please see the map?

717
00:41:29.066 --> 00:41:30.367
-No.
-Seriously!


718
00:41:30.401 --> 00:41:32.837
You won't let me hold it
for even one minute?


719
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.872
Nope. Not even for one second.

720
00:41:34.905 --> 00:41:39.176
Come on, Kitty.
You've got to trust me.


721
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:42.746
Wait. Wh-Wh-What's...
What's going on with his eyes?


722
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.116
Oh, they're getting bigger.

723
00:41:45.149 --> 00:41:47.418
Oh, Kitty!

724
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:49.720
You got to trust him.
Look at those eyes.


725
00:41:49.753 --> 00:41:52.022
Really? You call that cute?

726
00:41:53.257 --> 00:41:55.326
Oh, look at her!

727
00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:58.262
Those eyes are even bigger
than yours.


728
00:41:58.295 --> 00:41:59.663
Do whatever she wants, Puss.

729
00:41:59.697 --> 00:42:02.733
Wait a second. So poofy!

730
00:42:02.766 --> 00:42:05.136
No. With the paws?

731
00:42:05.169 --> 00:42:06.670
Come on.

732
00:42:06.704 --> 00:42:08.405
With the hat?

733
00:42:08.439 --> 00:42:11.275
It's all so cute!

734
00:42:11.308 --> 00:42:14.678
Cuteness overload!

735
00:42:15.713 --> 00:42:17.414
Can we look at the map now?

736
00:42:22.052 --> 00:42:24.155
"Follow this enchanted chart.

737
00:42:24.188 --> 00:42:28.225
It knows your path
and knows your heart."


738
00:42:29.193 --> 00:42:31.262
Is that us?

739
00:42:45.943 --> 00:42:49.313
It says we must go through
the Valley of Incineration


740
00:42:49.346 --> 00:42:51.215
over Undertaker Ridge,

741
00:42:51.248 --> 00:42:53.017
through the Cave of Lost Souls?

742
00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.753
-Really?
-Let me take a look.


743
00:43:09.366 --> 00:43:10.734
What?

744
00:43:10.768 --> 00:43:12.803
Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

745
00:43:12.836 --> 00:43:14.772
Mountains of Misery?

746
00:43:14.805 --> 00:43:17.041
The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

747
00:43:17.074 --> 00:43:19.243
There's something wrong
with this map.


748
00:43:19.276 --> 00:43:21.845
I guess there is a different
terrible path for everyone.


749
00:43:21.879 --> 00:43:23.414
It's almost like the forest

750
00:43:23.447 --> 00:43:25.849
doesn't want anyone
to make a wish.


751
00:43:25.883 --> 00:43:28.786
Well, I don't even have a wish,
but can I try?


752
00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:36.961
Oh, mine says...

753
00:43:36.994 --> 00:43:38.796
We skip through
the Pocket Full of Posies.


754
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:40.030
-What?
-Huh?


755
00:43:40.064 --> 00:43:42.233
Then drift down
the River of Relaxation.


756
00:43:42.266 --> 00:43:43.400
-That sounds fun.
-No fair.


757
00:43:43.434 --> 00:43:45.002
Why does he get the good one?

758
00:43:45.035 --> 00:43:47.171
Wander the Fields
of Quick and Easy Solutions,


759
00:43:47.204 --> 00:43:48.505
and arrive at the star.

760
00:43:48.539 --> 00:43:51.308
Oh, wow! That sounds wonderful.

761
00:43:51.342 --> 00:43:53.277
Oh, but no. This is your quest.

762
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.511
I don't want to impose.

763
00:43:54.545 --> 00:43:56.447
You hold the map.
-Really?


764
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.881
But don't you cross me,

765
00:43:57.915 --> 00:44:00.451
or your name will be
Perro Muerto.


766
00:44:00.484 --> 00:44:02.186
Okey dokey.

767
00:44:04.955 --> 00:44:07.124
Wait. Is that...

768
00:44:09.026 --> 00:44:11.028
It's raining bears. Time to go.

769
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:13.163
Oh, I'm tellin' ya,

770
00:44:13.197 --> 00:44:14.798
when we get that wish,

771
00:44:14.832 --> 00:44:17.167
it will make everything
just right for all of us.


772
00:44:17.201 --> 00:44:19.003
Will it make us rich?

773
00:44:19.036 --> 00:44:21.238
Rich enough to hibernate
all the year round?


774
00:44:21.272 --> 00:44:22.840
The richest.

775
00:44:22.873 --> 00:44:24.408
Will we be, like,
big-time thieves?


776
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:26.543
The biggest.

777
00:44:26.577 --> 00:44:28.879
Eh, you know that suit
Jack Horner wears?


778
00:44:28.912 --> 00:44:30.414
-Yeah.
-I'm going to have one of them.


779
00:44:30.447 --> 00:44:32.483
-Yeah?
-Only mine will be purpler.


780
00:44:32.516 --> 00:44:35.219
-Like, twice as purpler.
-The purplest!


781
00:44:35.252 --> 00:44:36.920
Nice.

782
00:44:36.954 --> 00:44:38.889
Big-time thieves coming through!

783
00:44:38.922 --> 00:44:41.058
-I'll race ya!
-You can't beat me, old man!


784
00:44:41.091 --> 00:44:42.960
What kind of wish
can do all that, Goldi?


785
00:44:42.993 --> 00:44:44.862
Oh, I can't tell ya.

786
00:44:44.895 --> 00:44:47.531
If you say what your wish is,
then it don't come true.


787
00:44:47.564 --> 00:44:49.166
Sorry. Birthday wish rules.

788
00:44:49.199 --> 00:44:52.036
Oh, come on.
Mother-daughter secret?


789
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:53.570
Mama, just drop it, please.

790
00:44:53.604 --> 00:44:55.205
Oh. Oh, okay.

791
00:44:55.239 --> 00:44:56.440
Hey, come on.

792
00:44:56.473 --> 00:44:58.442
We've got some cats to catch.

793
00:45:02.546 --> 00:45:04.915
Birthday wish rules?
What's that mean?


794
00:45:04.948 --> 00:45:07.184
It means I am not
telling you my wish.


795
00:45:07.217 --> 00:45:09.887
He doesn't want to tell us,
because it's something stupid.


796
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.356
Like conditioner
for that thing on his face.


797
00:45:12.389 --> 00:45:14.058
It's distinguished.

798
00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:17.061
What about you, Kitty?
What are you gonna wish for?


799
00:45:17.629 --> 00:45:18.862
Can't tell you.

800
00:45:18.896 --> 00:45:20.864
Birthday wish rules or whatever.

801
00:45:20.898 --> 00:45:23.100
Ha! I bet your wish
is something stupid like...


802
00:45:26.236 --> 00:45:27.905
You're such a...

803
00:45:31.909 --> 00:45:35.245
This must be
the Pocket Full of Posies.


804
00:45:38.949 --> 00:45:40.652
Out of the way, demon flower.

805
00:45:40.685 --> 00:45:42.620
It's pruning time!

806
00:45:50.361 --> 00:45:52.262
Aw, thank you.

807
00:45:54.998 --> 00:45:56.467
We don't have time for this.

808
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.103
<i>Perro,</i> I thought your path
was supposed to be easy.


809
00:46:00.537 --> 00:46:02.674
You know, I think
all you have to do


810
00:46:02.707 --> 00:46:04.475
is stop and smell the roses.

811
00:46:04.508 --> 00:46:05.976
Seriously?

812
00:46:07.277 --> 00:46:08.512
This is stupid.

813
00:46:08.545 --> 00:46:11.382
-All I smell is bull...
-Shh.


814
00:46:11.415 --> 00:46:12.583
Watch.

815
00:46:16.053 --> 00:46:17.287
Don't rush through it.

816
00:46:17.321 --> 00:46:19.990
Take your time
and really appreciate


817
00:46:20.023 --> 00:46:21.525
what's right in front of you.

818
00:46:24.294 --> 00:46:27.131
Ugh. His path is so corny.

819
00:46:27.164 --> 00:46:29.032
-Gracias.
-And cheesy.


820
00:46:29.066 --> 00:46:31.235
-And lame.
-And weird, like him.


821
00:46:31.268 --> 00:46:34.071
Yeah. Why are you
so ridiculous, dog?


822
00:46:34.104 --> 00:46:35.506
What's your story?

823
00:46:35.539 --> 00:46:37.040
My story? Oh.

824
00:46:37.074 --> 00:46:39.644
It's actually
a very funny story.


825
00:46:39.677 --> 00:46:41.178
Back when I was a pup,

826
00:46:41.211 --> 00:46:43.147
me and my littermates lived
with a family.


827
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.417
A family full of pranksters
who liked to play hide-and-seek,


828
00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.018
and I was always it.

829
00:46:48.051 --> 00:46:50.220
Pick on the little guy,
am I right?


830
00:46:50.254 --> 00:46:53.257
They tried putting me in
a packing crate, a dumpster.


831
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:56.661
No matter how hard they tried,
I'd always find them.


832
00:46:56.694 --> 00:46:59.196
So, one day, they get creative

833
00:46:59.229 --> 00:47:02.366
and they put me in a sock
with a rock in it.


834
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.437
And then throw me in a river.

835
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.173
I gnawed a hole in the sock,

836
00:47:09.206 --> 00:47:12.142
and I swam to the surface.

837
00:47:12.176 --> 00:47:14.578
Never found them
or my littermates.


838
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:16.447
So I guess I'm still it.

839
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.048
Wow.

840
00:47:18.081 --> 00:47:21.185
That is the saddest
funny story I've ever heard.


841
00:47:21.218 --> 00:47:23.120
Well, joke's on them.

842
00:47:23.153 --> 00:47:26.156
That sock they put me in,
I grew into it.


843
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.460
So, I got a great story
and a free sweater out of it.


844
00:47:29.493 --> 00:47:30.695
Win-win.

845
00:47:30.728 --> 00:47:32.296
Dude, you didn't win.

846
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:34.364
You of all people
should have a wish.


847
00:47:34.398 --> 00:47:36.701
I already have a comfy sweater
and two best friends.


848
00:47:36.734 --> 00:47:38.402
I got everything
I could wish for.


849
00:47:38.435 --> 00:47:41.238
No magic required.

850
00:47:41.271 --> 00:47:42.506
Hmm?

851
00:47:51.816 --> 00:47:53.751
Oh, lovely.

852
00:48:00.257 --> 00:48:02.025
Oh, we're getting really close.

853
00:48:02.059 --> 00:48:05.362
I can smell two cats,
a dog and... pie?


854
00:48:06.563 --> 00:48:10.234
Well, if it isn't the idiots
who tried to steal from me.


855
00:48:10.267 --> 00:48:11.669
Hey, he remembers us.

856
00:48:11.703 --> 00:48:14.304
Behold, Excali...

857
00:48:14.338 --> 00:48:15.707
Excali...

858
00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.076
Excalibur!

859
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:20.778
Yeah, I couldn't get
this rock off of it,


860
00:48:20.812 --> 00:48:22.246
but still pretty cool, right?

861
00:48:22.279 --> 00:48:23.648
He's gaining on us!

862
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:25.382
Okay, little left.

863
00:48:25.415 --> 00:48:26.784
That's it!

864
00:48:26.818 --> 00:48:29.253
-Go faster!
-Whoa, he's up me back door.


865
00:48:32.155 --> 00:48:34.391
Goldi!

866
00:48:41.465 --> 00:48:44.669
Oh, look!

867
00:48:44.702 --> 00:48:46.804
Well, start chopping!

868
00:48:46.838 --> 00:48:49.540
On it! You don't
have to tell me twice.


869
00:48:49.573 --> 00:48:53.043
I'm gonna chop the heck
out of this <i>Ficus lyra...</i>


870
00:48:53.845 --> 00:48:56.079
Jerry, no!

871
00:48:56.714 --> 00:48:58.148
Avenge me, Jack!

872
00:48:58.181 --> 00:48:59.684
Die, die, die!

873
00:48:59.717 --> 00:49:02.252
Nope.

874
00:49:02.286 --> 00:49:04.689
Time to bring out the big guns.

875
00:49:04.722 --> 00:49:06.724
Guess I overpacked.

876
00:49:06.758 --> 00:49:08.125
Magic snacks.

877
00:49:08.158 --> 00:49:09.661
Save those for later.

878
00:49:09.694 --> 00:49:12.462
Ha! Pay dirt.

879
00:49:13.363 --> 00:49:16.366
All right, magical locust,
defoliate.


880
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.635
Fly and feast.

881
00:49:17.669 --> 00:49:20.237
Eat those flowers.

882
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.573
I
-I'm not a magic locust.

883
00:49:22.606 --> 00:49:24.608
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

884
00:49:24.642 --> 00:49:27.110
What are you, then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?


885
00:49:27.144 --> 00:49:28.713
A deadly fairy?

886
00:49:28.746 --> 00:49:30.480
Put a spell on the forest, then.

887
00:49:30.514 --> 00:49:31.883
I
-I don't cast spells.

888
00:49:31.916 --> 00:49:34.585
-Well, what do you do?
-Well, I-I-I judge you.


889
00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:38.188
I sit on your shoulder
and judge your actions


890
00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:40.190
and the quality
of your character.


891
00:49:40.223 --> 00:49:41.726
I'm your conscience.

892
00:49:41.759 --> 00:49:43.327
I really did overpack.

893
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.896
Whoa!

894
00:49:44.929 --> 00:49:46.831
Help me, Jack! Help!

895
00:49:46.864 --> 00:49:48.733
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

896
00:49:48.766 --> 00:49:50.367
You're losing a lot of men.

897
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.369
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.


898
00:49:52.402 --> 00:49:55.873
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.


899
00:49:55.907 --> 00:49:57.809
These babies are gonna
get me that wish


900
00:49:57.842 --> 00:50:00.812
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.


901
00:50:00.845 --> 00:50:02.880
Now, now, Jack,
as your conscience, I...


902
00:50:02.914 --> 00:50:04.716
Oh, my word!

903
00:50:04.749 --> 00:50:06.416
It's the noble phoenix.

904
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.152
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal...


905
00:50:09.186 --> 00:50:10.688
Oh!

906
00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:14.626
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

907
00:50:14.659 --> 00:50:18.328
I really have my work
cut out for me on this one.


908
00:50:18.362 --> 00:50:22.399
Don't be near
where I'm flame-throwing.


909
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.676
Do your job, demon flowers.

910
00:50:31.709 --> 00:50:33.410
Soon.

911
00:50:37.481 --> 00:50:39.416
Okay, Kitty,
I think I've got it now.


912
00:50:41.284 --> 00:50:43.520
-Trust me!
-Easy, easy.


913
00:50:43.553 --> 00:50:45.522
You're gonna give yourself
a hernia.


914
00:50:45.555 --> 00:50:47.759
Here, one more time. Like this.

915
00:50:47.792 --> 00:50:50.394
Trust me.

916
00:50:50.427 --> 00:50:52.797
Aw. But of course
I trust you and Puss,


917
00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.531
even without the eyes.

918
00:50:54.564 --> 00:50:56.533
Yeah? Big mistake.

919
00:50:56.566 --> 00:50:58.301
What do you mean?
You're my friends.


920
00:50:58.335 --> 00:51:00.270
You know what trust gets you?

921
00:51:00.303 --> 00:51:03.373
A sock, a rock
and a swim in the river.


922
00:51:03.407 --> 00:51:05.208
You have to trust
somebody, right?


923
00:51:05.242 --> 00:51:06.678
Not me. Uh-uh.

924
00:51:06.711 --> 00:51:08.378
Whenever I've let my guard down,

925
00:51:08.412 --> 00:51:11.749
I've been double-crossed,
declawed, played and betrayed.


926
00:51:12.917 --> 00:51:14.686
Never again.

927
00:51:14.719 --> 00:51:16.253
I am a solo act.

928
00:51:16.286 --> 00:51:19.556
I keep my secrets,
and I play my cards close.


929
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:22.225
That's how you get
a winning hand.


930
00:51:22.259 --> 00:51:23.695
Take it from me.

931
00:51:23.728 --> 00:51:25.362
Never trust anyone.

932
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.434
W
-Wait.

933
00:51:30.467 --> 00:51:32.937
That's amazing.

934
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.471
You're good.

935
00:51:34.504 --> 00:51:36.974
Kitty, I've been thinking.

936
00:51:37.008 --> 00:51:39.010
Ugh, thinking about what?

937
00:51:39.043 --> 00:51:40.945
My beautiful beard.

938
00:51:40.978 --> 00:51:42.747
It is very distinguished, yes,

939
00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:48.385
but it does deprive the world
a good look at, uh, the face.


940
00:51:48.418 --> 00:51:53.356
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to...


941
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:54.826
-I've gotten used to it.
-Wait, what?


942
00:51:54.859 --> 00:51:56.493
The beard-- keep it.

943
00:51:56.526 --> 00:52:00.263
Uh, well, you see, uh...

944
00:52:00.297 --> 00:52:02.734
Kitty, please,
get this itchy thing off of me!


945
00:52:02.767 --> 00:52:04.702
It's like a fever on my face!

946
00:52:04.736 --> 00:52:09.272
Hold on. Is the great
Puss in Boots asking for help?


947
00:52:09.306 --> 00:52:10.975
<i>Sí,</i> help. 
You were right.

948
00:52:11.008 --> 00:52:13.543
-The beard is disgusting.
-And?


949
00:52:13.577 --> 00:52:16.781
And it's like a possum
crawled on my face.


950
00:52:16.814 --> 00:52:17.849
And?

951
00:52:17.882 --> 00:52:20.484
And died of shame.

952
00:52:20.517 --> 00:52:22.385
Okay, okay, possum face.

953
00:52:24.055 --> 00:52:26.523
I won't make you beg.

954
00:52:27.959 --> 00:52:29.761
Ow!

955
00:52:29.794 --> 00:52:30.928
Hey, slow down. Oh!

956
00:52:30.962 --> 00:52:32.295
Go with the grain.

957
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:34.031
You got to go with the grain.

958
00:52:34.065 --> 00:52:35.633
-I know what I'm doing.
-Hey!


959
00:52:35.666 --> 00:52:39.036
I'm a master of the blade.
Right, Perrito?


960
00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:41.304
What? What? What's funny?

961
00:52:41.338 --> 00:52:43.373
-Nothing should be funny.
-Shh. <i>Quieto.</i>


962
00:52:51.616 --> 00:52:54.551
Ah, there's that handsome face
I remember.


963
00:52:54.584 --> 00:52:56.988
The face I haven't seen since...

964
00:52:57.021 --> 00:52:59.322
-Hey!
-...Santa Coloma.


965
00:52:59.356 --> 00:53:02.794
Ah, yes. Santa Coloma.

966
00:53:02.827 --> 00:53:04.629
You had it coming.

967
00:53:05.696 --> 00:53:09.366
Here. You can have
my <i>gatit</i> blade.


968
00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:11.702
Thank you.

969
00:53:11.736 --> 00:53:13.303
Better than a stick.

970
00:53:15.572 --> 00:53:18.441
<i>Vaya con Dios,</i> stick sword.

971
00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.681
<i>Perro,</i> what are you doing?

972
00:53:23.714 --> 00:53:26.083
<i>Perro.</i>

973
00:53:26.117 --> 00:53:27.484
Where did that crazy dog go?

974
00:53:27.517 --> 00:53:28.953
I think you like him.

975
00:53:28.986 --> 00:53:30.487
No. No, I don't.

976
00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.355
I think
you're ready to name him.


977
00:53:32.389 --> 00:53:35.092
No, I just need his easy path
to get my wish.


978
00:53:35.126 --> 00:53:36.560
You mean my wish.

979
00:53:36.593 --> 00:53:38.796
You mean my wish!

980
00:53:39.797 --> 00:53:41.364
Sorry.

981
00:53:48.739 --> 00:53:50.975
-The Baker's Dozen.
-Let him go.


982
00:53:51.008 --> 00:53:53.110
Oh, I don't know.
I might keep him.


983
00:53:53.144 --> 00:53:55.445
Would you like a treat?

984
00:53:55.478 --> 00:53:57.447
Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

985
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.083
It's not a granny bag.

986
00:53:59.116 --> 00:54:01.451
It is a magic nanny bag.

987
00:54:01.484 --> 00:54:03.453
Now, make with the map,

988
00:54:03.486 --> 00:54:07.124
or we'll see what
the unicorn horn really does.


989
00:54:08.893 --> 00:54:12.063
Y-Y-You're not gonna shoot
a puppy, are you, Jack?


990
00:54:12.096 --> 00:54:13.563
Yeah, in the face. Why?

991
00:54:13.597 --> 00:54:15.465
What the...

992
00:54:15.498 --> 00:54:17.434
Give us the map, or else

993
00:54:17.467 --> 00:54:18.703
-the baker man gets it.
-Yeah!


994
00:54:18.736 --> 00:54:21.839
I don't even have the map,
Little Bo Creep.


995
00:54:23.107 --> 00:54:24.942
Stop throwing my men at me!

996
00:54:24.976 --> 00:54:27.178
Come here!

997
00:54:27.211 --> 00:54:28.612
Puss in Boots has the map!

998
00:54:28.646 --> 00:54:31.749
Let's get him!

999
00:54:33.217 --> 00:54:35.485
I've got a plan.

1000
00:54:35.518 --> 00:54:38.122
First one to the dog
gets the wish!


1001
00:54:38.155 --> 00:54:39.422
What?

1002
00:54:39.456 --> 00:54:41.659
Oh, come on!

1003
00:54:51.802 --> 00:54:53.804
Steady.

1004
00:54:55.139 --> 00:54:56.807
Whoa!

1005
00:54:58.209 --> 00:55:00.044
What?

1006
00:55:01.578 --> 00:55:03.147
So that's what they do. Cool.

1007
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.016
No! Not cool.

1008
00:55:05.049 --> 00:55:06.851
Ah, you shot me.

1009
00:55:08.485 --> 00:55:09.954
Ah, the sight's off.

1010
00:55:11.554 --> 00:55:13.791
-I got him, Mr. Horner!
-My bad.


1011
00:55:13.824 --> 00:55:14.926
Oh, no.

1012
00:55:44.587 --> 00:55:46.157
Puss, wait!

1013
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.125
<i>Perro.</i>

1014
00:55:48.159 --> 00:55:50.861
Thanks for the map, Softpaws.

1015
00:55:59.203 --> 00:56:01.038
-No, no, no!
-No!


1016
00:56:01.072 --> 00:56:05.109
Oi! You've just been crimed
by the Three Bears Crime Family.


1017
00:56:05.142 --> 00:56:07.610
-Yeah!
-So long, you plonkers!


1018
00:56:07.645 --> 00:56:10.114
<i>!Los voy hacer a todos</i>
<i>alfombras de baño!</i>


1019
00:56:10.147 --> 00:56:12.917
Puss, where are you?

1020
00:56:23.194 --> 00:56:25.495
Puss? Puss?

1021
00:56:26.931 --> 00:56:28.699
Puss!

1022
00:56:33.204 --> 00:56:34.571
Puss.

1023
00:56:34.604 --> 00:56:35.840
What's wrong?

1024
00:57:09.106 --> 00:57:11.108
Thank you, Perrito.

1025
00:57:11.142 --> 00:57:13.543
What's going on with you, Puss?

1026
00:57:14.845 --> 00:57:16.747
I...

1027
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:19.650
I am down to my last life.

1028
00:57:19.683 --> 00:57:21.886
And, uh, I...

1029
00:57:23.054 --> 00:57:24.587
I am afraid.

1030
00:57:24.622 --> 00:57:27.792
Well, it's okay to be afraid.

1031
00:57:27.825 --> 00:57:29.960
No, not for Puss in Boots.

1032
00:57:29.994 --> 00:57:32.863
I-I'm supposed to be
a fearless hero.


1033
00:57:32.897 --> 00:57:34.331
A legend.

1034
00:57:34.365 --> 00:57:39.737
But without lives to spare,
I am nothing.


1035
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.373
I need that wish
to get my lives back.


1036
00:57:42.406 --> 00:57:43.774
You should tell Kitty.

1037
00:57:43.808 --> 00:57:45.309
-She would understa...
-No, no, no, no.


1038
00:57:45.342 --> 00:57:47.111
She cannot hear of this.

1039
00:57:47.144 --> 00:57:48.112
Okay.

1040
00:57:49.747 --> 00:57:50.948
<i>¿Adónde fueron ese idiota</i>
<i>y su perro?</i>


1041
00:57:50.981 --> 00:57:52.817
Kitty will never trust me again.

1042
00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:54.819
Not after Santa Coloma.

1043
00:57:54.852 --> 00:57:57.021
But that's just one bad heist.

1044
00:57:57.054 --> 00:58:00.291
Santa Coloma wasn't a heist,
Perrito.


1045
00:58:00.324 --> 00:58:05.696
It was a church,
with a priest and guests.


1046
00:58:05.729 --> 00:58:07.398
<i>And Kitty.</i>

1047
00:58:07.431 --> 00:58:11.001
<i>Everything but me.</i>

1048
00:58:11.035 --> 00:58:12.970
I ran away then, too.

1049
00:58:13.003 --> 00:58:15.306
Oh. Oh.

1050
00:58:15.339 --> 00:58:17.308
Oh!

1051
00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:20.044
You left her at the altar?

1052
00:58:20.077 --> 00:58:21.212
It was wrong. I know.

1053
00:58:21.245 --> 00:58:23.681
I am ashamed.

1054
00:58:23.714 --> 00:58:27.351
I just wish I hadn't
hurt her so badly.


1055
00:58:27.384 --> 00:58:29.720
I regret that day.

1056
00:58:30.387 --> 00:58:32.857
So, maybe you should
tell that to Kitty.


1057
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:35.759
Might make you feel better.

1058
00:58:35.793 --> 00:58:38.796
Might make her feel better, too.

1059
00:58:40.898 --> 00:58:42.733
Puss! Dog!

1060
00:58:42.766 --> 00:58:44.268
Oh, there you are.

1061
00:58:44.301 --> 00:58:45.703
What happened back there?

1062
00:58:45.736 --> 00:58:48.005
Kitty. I lost the map.

1063
00:58:48.038 --> 00:58:49.206
I messed up.

1064
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.674
We'll get it back.

1065
00:58:50.708 --> 00:58:51.809
We've been in worse pickles.

1066
00:58:51.842 --> 00:58:53.310
Who told you that name?

1067
00:58:53.344 --> 00:58:54.411
What name?

1068
00:58:54.445 --> 00:58:56.313
Uh, nothing.

1069
00:58:56.347 --> 00:59:01.852
The bears! We have to find them
before they find the star.


1070
00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.156
Oh! We are so close.

1071
00:59:05.189 --> 00:59:07.291
It's finally happening.

1072
00:59:07.324 --> 00:59:09.326
I can taste that wish now.

1073
00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.362
And you know
what it tastes like?


1074
00:59:11.395 --> 00:59:13.197
-Pies?
-♪ Pies ♪


1075
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:16.033

1078
00:59:19.904 --> 00:59:21.772
Oh, it's gonna be wicked.

1079
00:59:21.805 --> 00:59:26.043
Yeah. Imagine us,
a big-time crime syndicate.


1080
00:59:26.076 --> 00:59:28.779
Not a big-time
crime syndicate, love.


1081
00:59:28.812 --> 00:59:31.182
A big-time crime family.

1082
00:59:31.215 --> 00:59:33.150
Isn't that right, Goldi?

1083
00:59:33.184 --> 00:59:34.218
-Goldi?
-What?


1084
00:59:35.186 --> 00:59:37.388
Whoa! Hey, look,
the map is going all fizzly.


1085
00:59:37.421 --> 00:59:38.789
What did you do?

1086
00:59:38.822 --> 00:59:40.724
-Give it me. No, no, no, no.
-Hey!


1087
00:59:42.226 --> 00:59:43.327
Goldi, no biting!

1088
00:59:45.362 --> 00:59:47.064
You're the smash, I'm the grab.

1089
00:59:47.097 --> 00:59:48.232
I hold the map.

1090
00:59:48.265 --> 00:59:49.400
-You got it?
-Okay!


1091
00:59:51.869 --> 00:59:54.738
"To find your wish,
adjust your view.


1092
00:59:54.772 --> 00:59:57.341
What you seek
may be right in front of you."


1093
00:59:57.374 --> 01:00:00.244
Well, that's a load of rubbish.
What's that supposed to mean?


1094
01:00:01.412 --> 01:00:03.514
Right in front of us.

1095
01:00:03.547 --> 01:00:05.349
It looks like
our cabin back home.


1096
01:00:05.382 --> 01:00:06.784
You really think our cabin

1097
01:00:06.817 --> 01:00:08.352
is in the middle
of the Dark Forest?


1098
01:00:08.385 --> 01:00:10.821
Baby, give it
the old sniff test.


1099
01:00:10.854 --> 01:00:13.090
Something's cooking.

1100
01:00:13.123 --> 01:00:15.226
No.

1101
01:00:15.259 --> 01:00:16.894
Do not open that door.

1102
01:00:16.927 --> 01:00:19.363
We are home! Hello, door.

1103
01:00:19.396 --> 01:00:20.965
Oh, no, don't go insi...

1104
01:00:20.998 --> 01:00:22.499
Maybe just a quick pop in.

1105
01:00:22.533 --> 01:00:25.035
-Hello, chairs.
-What say we hibernate?


1106
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:26.370
Hello, honey.

1107
01:00:26.403 --> 01:00:28.505
Hello, my old friend.

1108
01:00:28.539 --> 01:00:31.308
I have missed you so...

1109
01:00:33.143 --> 01:00:35.246
Look, Goldi. Porridge.

1110
01:00:35.279 --> 01:00:37.848
And it's made
just the way you like it.


1111
01:00:37.881 --> 01:00:39.917
No matter how you make it,
she doesn't like it.


1112
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.452
Stop it, all of you.

1113
01:00:41.485 --> 01:00:43.387
Maybe our wishes
have been granted.


1114
01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.856
Just stop.
It's not our wish granted.


1115
01:00:45.889 --> 01:00:46.924
It's an obstacle.

1116
01:00:46.957 --> 01:00:49.893
It's the forest playing tricks.

1117
01:00:49.927 --> 01:00:52.129
This isn't real.
None of this is...


1118
01:01:02.306 --> 01:01:05.109
Aw. That was your favorite book.

1119
01:01:05.142 --> 01:01:08.112
You used to stare at it
for hours.


1120
01:01:24.629 --> 01:01:26.463
Too hard.

1121
01:01:26.497 --> 01:01:28.065
Whoop!

1122
01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:30.401
Too soft.

1123
01:01:35.339 --> 01:01:38.042
Just right.

1124
01:01:38.643 --> 01:01:40.544
Oh, this was it.

1125
01:01:40.577 --> 01:01:41.979
What was it, Mama?

1126
01:01:42.012 --> 01:01:43.580
The day a little orphan girl

1127
01:01:43.615 --> 01:01:46.583
broke into our cabin
and stole our hearts.


1128
01:01:50.622 --> 01:01:55.025
The day when our world
became just right.


1129
01:01:58.395 --> 01:02:02.466
How's it going?
Can you see anything up there?


1130
01:02:02.499 --> 01:02:04.568
Not yet, Perrito...

1131
01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:06.904
-You okay?
<i>-Sí,</i> I am good.


1132
01:02:06.937 --> 01:02:08.572
So good.

1133
01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:16.947
If you wanted to hold my hand,
all you had to do is ask.


1134
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.950
Uh, just, uh,
feel free to pull me up


1135
01:02:19.983 --> 01:02:21.653
whenever you get a chance.

1136
01:02:21.686 --> 01:02:24.121
Oh, I was just remembering

1137
01:02:24.154 --> 01:02:26.624
the last time
I offered you my hand.


1138
01:02:26.658 --> 01:02:29.860
Only, that time,
I believe you had cold feet.


1139
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.401
Kitty...

1140
01:02:41.405 --> 01:02:43.240
About that day.

1141
01:02:43.273 --> 01:02:46.377
Puss in Boots is not
supposed to be afraid.


1142
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:50.648
But outside that church
in Santa Coloma,


1143
01:02:50.682 --> 01:02:56.220
that was the first time
I ever felt fear.


1144
01:02:56.253 --> 01:02:59.189
So I ran.

1145
01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:03.260
It was a mistake, Kitty.

1146
01:03:03.293 --> 01:03:04.561
It's okay.

1147
01:03:04.595 --> 01:03:06.964
-No, no. It was cowardly.
-It's okay.


1148
01:03:06.997 --> 01:03:08.999
-You alone at the altar.
-Puss.


1149
01:03:09.032 --> 01:03:11.268
In your beautiful,
poofy wedding dress.


1150
01:03:11.301 --> 01:03:14.071
Puss! It's okay.

1151
01:03:14.104 --> 01:03:16.273
I didn't show up, either.

1152
01:03:16.306 --> 01:03:17.675
Wait, what?

1153
01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:20.010
What do you mean,
you didn't show up?


1154
01:03:20.043 --> 01:03:22.312
Well, I knew
I could never compete


1155
01:03:22.346 --> 01:03:24.281
with your one true love.

1156
01:03:24.314 --> 01:03:26.283
-Who?
-Yourself.


1157
01:03:26.316 --> 01:03:27.351
The legend.

1158
01:03:27.384 --> 01:03:28.585
Uh...

1159
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.054
I wasn't gonna show up
for that guy.


1160
01:03:32.322 --> 01:03:35.359
But you don't seem
like that guy anymore.


1161
01:03:38.495 --> 01:03:40.698
Everything okay up there?

1162
01:03:40.732 --> 01:03:43.000
I'm giving you a thumbs-up,
just so you know.


1163
01:03:43.033 --> 01:03:44.501
Puss!

1164
01:03:46.503 --> 01:03:48.338
Look.

1165
01:03:50.507 --> 01:03:52.276
What do you think, bug?

1166
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:54.746
Do I wait for the cats to steal
the map and then kill them,


1167
01:03:54.779 --> 01:03:57.247
or do I just kill everybody
all at once?


1168
01:03:57.281 --> 01:03:59.316
You know, I'm starting to think

1169
01:03:59.349 --> 01:04:01.985
you don't appreciate
the value of a life.


1170
01:04:02.019 --> 01:04:03.454
What? No.

1171
01:04:03.487 --> 01:04:04.988
I mean, I love these guys.

1172
01:04:06.323 --> 01:04:08.492
Flex the glutes.
I need a solid surface.


1173
01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.095
There's good in all people.
There's good in all people.


1174
01:04:12.129 --> 01:04:15.065
You know, Jack, maybe we need
to dig a little deeper.


1175
01:04:15.098 --> 01:04:17.434
T
-Tell me about your childhood.

1176
01:04:19.102 --> 01:04:21.338
You know,
I never had much as a kid.


1177
01:04:21.371 --> 01:04:25.342
Just loving parents
and stability and a mansion


1178
01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:28.780
and a thriving baked goods
enterprise for me to inherit.


1179
01:04:28.813 --> 01:04:31.215
Useless crap like that.

1180
01:04:32.717 --> 01:04:34.652
But once I get my wish,

1181
01:04:34.686 --> 01:04:38.756
I'll finally have the one thing
that will make me happy.


1182
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.124
Oh, well, what's that?

1183
01:04:41.158 --> 01:04:43.293
All of the magic in the world.

1184
01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:45.062
For me.

1185
01:04:45.095 --> 01:04:47.097
And no one else gets any.

1186
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.099
-Is that so much?
-Yes!


1187
01:04:49.132 --> 01:04:50.635
Agree to disagree.

1188
01:04:50.668 --> 01:04:52.436
All right, bring it over.

1189
01:04:59.343 --> 01:05:00.812
Help!

1190
01:05:00.845 --> 01:05:03.748
Sweet Mother of Goose, Jack!

1191
01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:05.516
Well, you know what they say.

1192
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:08.452
Can't bake a pie
without losing a dozen men.


1193
01:05:08.485 --> 01:05:11.388
Oh. Oh!

1194
01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:12.824
That was horrible.

1195
01:05:12.857 --> 01:05:14.626
Your wish is horrible.

1196
01:05:14.659 --> 01:05:15.760
You're horrible!

1197
01:05:15.793 --> 01:05:18.295
You're an irredeemable monster!

1198
01:05:18.328 --> 01:05:21.465
Oh, oh.
What took you so long, idiot?


1199
01:05:23.768 --> 01:05:25.435
You're not chatty, are you?

1200
01:05:25.469 --> 01:05:27.070
Mm-mm.

1201
01:05:28.572 --> 01:05:31.408
Okay, you take the window,
I'll take the chimney.


1202
01:05:31.441 --> 01:05:32.543
What do I take?

1203
01:05:32.576 --> 01:05:34.111
Oh, you take it easy, Perrito.

1204
01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:35.780
We need you
to stay here and, uh...


1205
01:05:35.813 --> 01:05:37.548
-Uh, uh, guard our rear.
-Yeah. Yeah.


1206
01:05:37.581 --> 01:05:40.384
On your six. Got your rears
eyeballed and covered.


1207
01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:41.585
Hands in, crew.

1208
01:05:41.619 --> 01:05:42.754
Ready?

1209
01:05:42.787 --> 01:05:44.656
Go, Team Friendship!

1210
01:05:44.689 --> 01:05:46.089
Team Friendship?

1211
01:05:46.123 --> 01:05:47.558
I did not agree to this.

1212
01:05:47.591 --> 01:05:49.727
Yeah, do better. Try harder.

1213
01:05:49.761 --> 01:05:50.862
Well, just a placeholder name,
you know.


1214
01:05:50.895 --> 01:05:52.195
I'll workshop it, okay?

1215
01:05:52.229 --> 01:05:53.397
-Go get 'em, tiger.
-Hey!


1216
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:55.499
Take it easy.

1217
01:05:57.635 --> 01:05:58.870
Ready to get our wish back?

1218
01:05:58.903 --> 01:06:00.504
"Our wish"?

1219
01:06:00.537 --> 01:06:03.808
Well, I've been thinking,
if you play your cards right,


1220
01:06:03.841 --> 01:06:07.110
maybe we could share the wish.

1221
01:06:07.745 --> 01:06:10.380
Share the wish.

1222
01:06:27.932 --> 01:06:29.901
It's gone!

1223
01:06:29.934 --> 01:06:31.268
Wake up.

1224
01:06:31.301 --> 01:06:32.569
Someone's nicked the map.

1225
01:06:32.603 --> 01:06:34.538
What's all this?
What's all this bother about?


1226
01:06:34.571 --> 01:06:35.840
Oi! Did you not hear her?

1227
01:06:35.873 --> 01:06:37.541
The map is missing.

1228
01:06:37.574 --> 01:06:40.344
Somebody took it.

1229
01:06:40.377 --> 01:06:41.278
Hola.

1230
01:06:41.311 --> 01:06:44.214
Oi! You criming us
when we just crimed you?


1231
01:06:44.247 --> 01:06:45.750
No, no crime-backs.

1232
01:06:45.783 --> 01:06:47.752
Oh, you're dead cat meat.

1233
01:06:47.785 --> 01:06:49.586
Okay, okay, okay.

1234
01:06:49.621 --> 01:06:51.756
It's all... yours!

1235
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:54.191
Nowhere to go, Softpaws.

1236
01:06:54.224 --> 01:06:57.527
Really? Let's see
what the map has to say.


1237
01:06:58.896 --> 01:07:00.430
No!

1238
01:07:00.464 --> 01:07:02.566
-Our cabin!
-My honey!


1239
01:07:02.599 --> 01:07:04.534
What the dickens?

1240
01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:07.371
Oh, no, you don't.

1241
01:07:12.242 --> 01:07:14.311
Oh, no.

1242
01:07:21.318 --> 01:07:22.954
-We're coming, Gol...
-I'll get it. I'll get it.


1243
01:07:22.987 --> 01:07:24.421
-Get off me, you big lump.
-Hold still.


1244
01:07:24.454 --> 01:07:26.490
Hold on! I'm coming, Team...

1245
01:07:27.892 --> 01:07:29.827
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry,
sorry, sorry!


1246
01:07:31.696 --> 01:07:33.363
Uh-oh.

1247
01:07:33.397 --> 01:07:35.700
-Shall we dance? I'll lead.
-Huh? Wha...


1248
01:07:36.668 --> 01:07:38.736
Aah! Too hot!

1249
01:07:40.805 --> 01:07:44.174
Aah! Too cold! Brain freeze.

1250
01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:50.882
Oh, that is just right.

1251

Aye? What the...

1252
01:08:20.878 --> 01:08:22.245
No!

1253
01:08:25.315 --> 01:08:27.952
Oi! Forget something?

1254
01:08:35.927 --> 01:08:37.394
They got Perrito!

1255
01:08:37.427 --> 01:08:39.463
Don't worry,
we can track them with this.


1256
01:08:40.765 --> 01:08:42.734
Wait, stop!

1257
01:08:47.972 --> 01:08:49.674
Puss, watch out!

1258
01:08:50.775 --> 01:08:52.442
Kitty!

1259
01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:53.678
Puss!

1260
01:08:57.048 --> 01:08:58.616
Look!

1261
01:09:00.718 --> 01:09:03.487
There, there they are.
Just out there.


1262
01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.757
You go get Perrito.
I'll find a way out of here.

Puss.

Hey, good-looking.

1265
01:09:35.552 --> 01:09:36.888
What is that?

1266
01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:39.056
Why so jumpy, amigo?

1267
01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:40.825
Whoa, what's happening?

1268
01:09:40.858 --> 01:09:42.860
Hello, Puss. Gazpacho?

1269
01:09:42.894 --> 01:09:44.461
Long time, no see.

1270
01:09:44.494 --> 01:09:46.931

Okay.

1279
01:10:04.447 --> 01:10:05.950

Them cats stole
the stolen map we stole,

01:10:29.941 --> 01:10:32.109
and we ended up with
diddly-squat-- nothing.

Or maybe we could be happy
without a wish.

They ain't coming back.


1292

Goodbye, purple trousers.

01:10:40.618 --> 01:10:42.987
Oh, they'll come back-- for him.

01:10:47.524 --> 01:10:49.160
which happens a lot--

1297
01:10:49.193 --> 01:10:51.128
'cause we're a team.

01:10:51.162 --> 01:10:53.097
-Aw, that's lovely.
-Yep.


1299
01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:54.564
Team Friendship.

1300
01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:56.566
Ugh. No! That is a crap name.

1301
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.468
Well, we're-we're...
we're still workshopping it.


1302
01:10:58.501 --> 01:11:00.872
Oh, them cats ain't gonna
risk their lives


1303
01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:02.472
for this daft little pup.

1304
01:11:02.505 --> 01:11:04.574
You're just saying that
because you want to eat 'im.


1305
01:11:04.608 --> 01:11:08.045
I do not. I just want
to pet him with my teeth.


1306
01:11:08.079 --> 01:11:10.047
Stop thinking about
your belly, Baby.


1307
01:11:10.081 --> 01:11:12.817
In fact, stop thinking, period.

1308
01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:14.919
You'll just hurt yourself,
you muppet.


1309
01:11:14.952 --> 01:11:16.187
"Muppet."

1310
01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.788
And why would I listen to

1311
01:11:17.822 --> 01:11:20.691
a porridge-stealing orphan
like you?


1312
01:11:20.725 --> 01:11:22.793
-You're not even a bear.
-Zing!


1313
01:11:22.827 --> 01:11:24.996
I'm more of a bear
than you are.


1314
01:11:25.029 --> 01:11:26.898
She got you.

1315
01:11:26.931 --> 01:11:29.667
You're nothing but
a low-rent Cinderella.


1316
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.567
Oh!

1317
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.136
Well, that's rich
coming from you, Baby,


1318
01:11:32.169 --> 01:11:33.771
'cause you know what you are?

1319
01:11:33.804 --> 01:11:34.571
Wait for it.

1320
01:11:34.604 --> 01:11:36.107
You're a daft, fat,

1321
01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.541
slow-thinking,
no-reading, Lyme-diseased,


1322
01:11:38.575 --> 01:11:40.077
flea-ridden dingleberry bear.

1323
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:41.178
Boom!

1324
01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:42.947
I haven't got dingleberries.

1325
01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.916
No, you do. You do have 'em.

1326
01:11:44.949 --> 01:11:46.050
Dingleberries!

1327
01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:47.584
Oi! You shut up,
you little mutt,


1328
01:11:47.618 --> 01:11:49.519
or I'll cut you
from pooper to snooter!


1329
01:11:49.552 --> 01:11:51.923
I'm in the mix now.

1330
01:11:51.956 --> 01:11:53.858
Okay! Okay, here we go.

1331
01:11:53.891 --> 01:11:56.459
You're all a bunch
of knuckle-dragging,


1332
01:11:56.493 --> 01:11:58.195
honey-scrounging, grub (bleep),

1333
01:11:58.229 --> 01:12:00.231
oafish (bleep),

1334

01:12:03.067 --> 01:12:05.568
and your snooter!

1337
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:08.172
I like the cut of his jib.

1338
01:12:08.205 --> 01:12:09.974
Ah, this is great.

1339
01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:14.679

1343
01:12:24.288 --> 01:12:26.090
I like his jib as well.

1344
01:12:26.123 --> 01:12:28.025
-Let's keep him.
-What?


1345
01:12:28.059 --> 01:12:30.527
Huh? Where'd he go?

1346
01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.030
-No! We said no crime-backs.

Yeah, but could you tell me
how to get out of here?


1354
01:12:51.148 --> 01:12:53.050
I've got to get back
to Dog and Kitty.


1355
01:12:53.985 --> 01:12:56.187
Whoa! I thought you were going
to get the wish.


1356

You got the map.
You don't need them.

Party to party.

1360

Puss in Boots walks alone.

1361
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.711
Yeah, Puss in Boots walks alone.

1362
01:13:21.979 --> 01:13:26.784
Was the legend so big there was
no room for anyone else?


1363
01:13:30.788 --> 01:13:32.623
Oh, the legend's
still big, <i>gato.</i>


1364
01:13:32.656 --> 01:13:34.158
It's you that got small.

1365
01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:36.293
Yeah, you changed, man.

1366
01:13:36.327 --> 01:13:38.329
I hear he's best friends
with a dog now.


1367
01:13:38.362 --> 01:13:40.231
And he doesn't even
have a sword.


1368
01:13:40.264 --> 01:13:42.333
Some hero.

1369
01:13:42.366 --> 01:13:44.635
You've become a scaredy-cat.

1370
01:13:44.668 --> 01:13:46.303
We should call him
Wuss in Boots.


1371
01:13:46.337 --> 01:13:47.772
Ah, no, no, no, no.

1372
01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:50.174
Didn't you hear?
His new name is Pickles.


1373
01:13:50.207 --> 01:13:51.909
So lame.

1374
01:13:51.942 --> 01:13:54.245
Where is your litter box,
Pickles?


1375
01:13:54.278 --> 01:13:56.313
You know what?
You guys are jerks.


1376
01:13:56.347 --> 01:13:58.315
Which is very conflicting
for me.


1377
01:13:58.349 --> 01:14:00.051
I'll find my own way out. Adios.

1378
01:14:00.084 --> 01:14:02.353
Oh, you think you are
better than us?


1379
01:14:02.386 --> 01:14:05.856
Without us, you will always
live a life of...


1380
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.825
Fear.

1381
01:14:07.858 --> 01:14:08.826
You.

1382
01:14:08.859 --> 01:14:11.729
I do love the smell of fear.

1383
01:14:11.762 --> 01:14:13.664
It's intoxicating.

1384
01:14:13.697 --> 01:14:15.099
It is?

1385
01:14:15.132 --> 01:14:18.601
Sorry to crash the party
with your past lives.


1386
01:14:18.636 --> 01:14:20.638
Or your past deaths,

1387
01:14:20.671 --> 01:14:22.706
as I like to call them.

1388
01:14:23.674 --> 01:14:27.211
I was there
to witness all of them.


1389
01:14:27.244 --> 01:14:30.848
Each frivolous end.

1390
01:14:30.881 --> 01:14:35.152
But you didn't even notice me

1391
01:14:35.186 --> 01:14:41.725
because Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death, right?


1392
01:14:42.726 --> 01:14:45.595
But you're not laughing now.

1393
01:14:46.163 --> 01:14:48.365
You are no bounty hunter.

1394
01:14:48.399 --> 01:14:50.034
You are...

1395
01:14:50.067 --> 01:14:52.570
Death.

1396
01:14:54.405 --> 01:14:55.973
And I don't mean it
metaphorically


1397
01:14:56.006 --> 01:14:58.876
or rhetorically or poetically
or theoretically


1398
01:14:58.909 --> 01:15:01.846
or in any other fancy way.

1399
01:15:01.879 --> 01:15:05.249
I'm Death, straight up.

1400
01:15:05.282 --> 01:15:08.219
And I've come for you,
Puss in Boots.


1401
01:15:08.252 --> 01:15:10.121
But I'm still alive.

1402
01:15:10.154 --> 01:15:11.722
You know...

1403
01:15:11.755 --> 01:15:13.858
I'm not a cat person.

1404
01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:18.863
I find the very idea
of nine lives absurd.


1405
01:15:18.896 --> 01:15:21.966
And you didn't value
any of them.


1406
01:15:21.999 --> 01:15:25.136
So, why don't I do us
both a favor


1407
01:15:25.169 --> 01:15:27.671
and take this last one now?

1408
01:15:27.705 --> 01:15:29.273
That's cheating!

1409
01:15:29.306 --> 01:15:31.008
Shh. Don't tell.

1410
01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:32.877
Run, Puss in Boots!

1411
01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:34.445
Make the wish!

1412
01:15:34.478 --> 01:15:36.680
Go ahead, run for it.

1413
01:15:36.714 --> 01:15:39.416
Makes it more fun for me.

1414
01:15:55.199 --> 01:15:57.001
Run.

1415
01:15:57.468 --> 01:16:00.137
Run.

1416
01:16:02.072 --> 01:16:03.140
Hey, Puss.

1417
01:16:03.174 --> 01:16:04.441
Run.

1418
01:16:04.475 --> 01:16:06.810
Puss! Puss, we're here!

1419
01:16:09.813 --> 01:16:12.082
Wh
-Where's he going?

1420
01:17:16.447 --> 01:17:18.015
That's the third time

1421
01:17:18.048 --> 01:17:19.850
we've passed
that same rock, Baby.


1422
01:17:19.883 --> 01:17:21.218
Oh, not again.

1423
01:17:21.252 --> 01:17:22.453
What do you want me to do?

1424
01:17:22.486 --> 01:17:24.154
I've lost the scent.

1425
01:17:24.188 --> 01:17:25.990
You only have one job.

1426
01:17:26.023 --> 01:17:29.126
The one thing that makes you
mildly useful is your nose,


1427
01:17:29.159 --> 01:17:31.428
and apparently,
you can't even use that.


1428
01:17:31.462 --> 01:17:32.963
-Goldi.
-I'm starting to think


1429
01:17:32.997 --> 01:17:34.531
this wish isn't
what you promised us.


1430
01:17:34.565 --> 01:17:37.101
-Leave off, Baby.
-So, what is it, eh?


1431
01:17:37.134 --> 01:17:40.070
What's your "just right"?
What's so blasted important


1432
01:17:40.104 --> 01:17:42.506
that you've got us stranded
in this haunted forest?


1433
01:17:42.539 --> 01:17:44.541
I'm getting a family!
That's what.


1434
01:17:44.575 --> 01:17:46.043
A proper family.

1435
01:17:46.076 --> 01:17:49.213
Then everything
will be just right.


1436
01:17:51.882 --> 01:17:56.053
Your "just right"
is getting rid of us?


1437
01:17:56.086 --> 01:17:58.589
Well, I guess some people
just stick around


1438
01:17:58.623 --> 01:18:01.859
until the porridge is gone,
eh, Goldi?


1439
01:18:04.595 --> 01:18:06.130
Come on.

1440
01:18:06.163 --> 01:18:09.366
You didn't think
I would actually stay.


1441
01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.135
I'm not a bear.

1442
01:18:20.077 --> 01:18:23.047
I was always afraid
it was too good to last.


1443
01:18:23.947 --> 01:18:25.916
And whether you think
we're your family or not,


1444
01:18:25.949 --> 01:18:29.453
if this is something
that will make you happy,


1445
01:18:29.486 --> 01:18:31.522
we'll get you that wish.

1446
01:18:31.555 --> 01:18:33.957
Come on, boys.

1447
01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:45.102
Oh, what a good boy am I.

1448
01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:56.046
"Star light, star bright,

1449
01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.616
"first star I see tonight,

1450
01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:00.017
I wish..."

1451
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:01.352
I can't believe
I fell for it again.


1452
01:19:01.385 --> 01:19:03.354
Kitty, you don't understand.

1453
01:19:03.387 --> 01:19:05.222
Don't understand what?

1454
01:19:05.255 --> 01:19:07.625
That you've been playing me
this whole time?


1455
01:19:07.659 --> 01:19:09.293
I need this wish.

1456
01:19:09.326 --> 01:19:12.296
Oh, yeah? You want to know
what my wish was?


1457
01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:16.033
Someone, anyone I could trust.

1458
01:19:16.066 --> 01:19:17.267
Hey!

1459
01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:20.137
In my whole life,
I've never had that.


1460
01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:23.474
But I thought I finally found
that someone


1461
01:19:23.507 --> 01:19:26.009
without a wish.

1462
01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:28.011
I thought it was you.

1463
01:19:29.146 --> 01:19:30.914
But you're still running.

1464
01:19:30.948 --> 01:19:33.584
Still the same old
Puss in Boots.


1465
01:19:33.618 --> 01:19:36.186
But I am not!
I am not Puss in Boots.


1466
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.655
I'm...

1467
01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:39.490
I am on my last life.

1468
01:19:39.523 --> 01:19:42.159
I need to get my lives back.

1469
01:19:42.192 --> 01:19:45.462
Without them, I am not...
I-I am not...


1470
01:19:45.496 --> 01:19:47.131
What? The legend?

1471
01:19:50.267 --> 01:19:53.971
I still can't compete
with your one true love.


1472
01:19:54.004 --> 01:19:56.240
Go on, get your lives back.

1473
01:19:57.975 --> 01:20:00.077
Just keep them out of mine.

1474
01:20:04.114 --> 01:20:06.583
Kitty, Death is after me!

1475
01:20:06.618 --> 01:20:08.218
What?

1476
01:20:08.252 --> 01:20:10.287
I've been called
a lot of things...


1477
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.689
but never Death.

1478
01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:13.157
I like it.

1479
01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:15.459
-That's my wish!
-Oi!


1480
01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.462
That's Goldi's wish.

1481
01:20:54.531 --> 01:20:56.099
Grab him!

1482
01:20:57.267 --> 01:20:58.736
Move! Out of my way!

1483
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:00.705
I've got it! I've got it!
Don't got it.


1484
01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.208
That's mine.

1485
01:21:10.581 --> 01:21:11.749
Bang, bang, bang!

1486
01:21:14.084 --> 01:21:16.320
Oh, come on.
You walked into that one.


1487
01:21:18.522 --> 01:21:20.424
Mr. Horner, I need your help!

1488
01:21:20.457 --> 01:21:23.327
Duly noted, but a little busy
at the moment.


1489
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.495
Pew, pew!

1490
01:21:24.528 --> 01:21:27.297
Mr. Horner!

1491
01:21:34.238 --> 01:21:35.506
Ooh.

1492
01:21:35.539 --> 01:21:38.275
Aha! It's bear season.

1493
01:21:39.443 --> 01:21:41.646
Oi, I'm gonna bust you up,
plum thumb,


1494
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:43.715
and then I'm gonna
wear your clothes.


1495
01:21:43.748 --> 01:21:45.249
That was weird.

1496
01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:49.253
No, no, no...

1497
01:21:49.286 --> 01:21:50.220
Baby!

1498
01:21:50.254 --> 01:21:51.789
-Mama, help!
-I got you!


1499
01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:53.758
-Papa!
-Son, I'm coming!


1500
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:55.459
-Got you.
-Help!


1501
01:21:55.492 --> 01:21:57.829
-Hold on!
-Something's happening!


1502
01:21:57.862 --> 01:21:59.363
Help me!

1503
01:22:01.164 --> 01:22:03.534
Help! No, no, no!

1504
01:22:03.567 --> 01:22:05.402
Hang on, son!

1505
01:22:05.435 --> 01:22:07.739
I can't stop it!

1506
01:22:07.772 --> 01:22:09.206
Mama, I'm slipping!

1507
01:22:09.239 --> 01:22:11.643
I'm slipping...

1508
01:22:15.479 --> 01:22:19.349
Like I told you, Baby,
you're the smash, I'm the grab.


1509
01:22:19.383 --> 01:22:21.485
Yes! Yes!

1510
01:22:24.321 --> 01:22:25.857
No!

1511
01:22:31.461 --> 01:22:34.832
Hey, Softpaws,
how do you like these apples?


1512
01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:38.302
Die! Blow up already.

1513
01:22:38.903 --> 01:22:40.872
Softpaws.

1514
01:22:42.139 --> 01:22:43.708
Okay.

1515
01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:48.312
Okay, you know, maybe it's time
to bury the hatchet!


1516
01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:53.350
Oh, I shouldn't have
telegraphed it!


1517
01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:04.796
Yeah, I don't know
what to do with this,


1518
01:23:04.829 --> 01:23:07.732
but if you think
you need those lives...


1519
01:23:07.765 --> 01:23:10.133
Thank you, Perrito.

1520
01:23:10.835 --> 01:23:13.437
You know,
I've only ever had one life,


1521
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:16.406
but sharing it
with you and Kitty


1522
01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.542
has made it pretty special.

1523
01:23:18.575 --> 01:23:22.112
Maybe one life is enough.

1524
01:23:29.787 --> 01:23:32.255
-Huh?
-What is that?


1525
01:23:38.462 --> 01:23:39.563
Who's that?

1526
01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:43.133
He's here for me.

1527
01:23:48.538 --> 01:23:50.474
Puss!

1528
01:23:54.846 --> 01:23:57.180
I've enjoyed the chase, <i>gato,</i>

1529
01:23:57.214 --> 01:24:00.150
but I think we've reached
the end now, you and I.


1530
01:24:01.251 --> 01:24:04.254
You gonna take
the coward's way out?


1531
01:24:04.287 --> 01:24:06.958
Run away to more lives?

1532
01:24:06.991 --> 01:24:09.426
Or are you gonna fight?

1533
01:24:14.598 --> 01:24:16.701
Pick it up.

1534
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:19.403
Go on, pick it up.

1535
01:24:36.721 --> 01:24:38.321
What's the matter?

1536
01:24:38.355 --> 01:24:40.892
Lives flashing before your eyes?

1537
01:24:40.925 --> 01:24:42.727
No.

1538
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.294
Just one.

1539
01:24:44.327 --> 01:24:46.296
I'm done running.

1540
01:24:49.934 --> 01:24:53.303
Fear me, if you dare.

1541
01:24:53.971 --> 01:24:56.974
This is gonna be fun.

1542
01:25:16.627 --> 01:25:18.029
<i>Bien.</i>

1543
01:25:18.062 --> 01:25:20.297
<i>Muy bien.</i>

1544
01:25:38.348 --> 01:25:40.618
You really got to stop
losing that.


1545
01:25:54.331 --> 01:25:57.267
Say hello to my <i>gatito</i> blade.

1546
01:26:01.906 --> 01:26:02.907
Come on!

1547
01:26:23.094 --> 01:26:24.594
Pick it up.

1548
01:26:25.696 --> 01:26:28.766
I know I can never
defeat you, lobo,


1549
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.502
but I will never stop fighting
for this life.


1550
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:56.961
<i>¿Por qué diablos fui a jugar</i>
<i>con mi comida?</i>


1551
01:26:56.994 --> 01:26:59.831
You're ruining this for me.

1552
01:26:59.864 --> 01:27:03.567
I came here for
an arrogant little legend


1553
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.870
who thought he was immortal.

1554
01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:10.107
But I don't see him anymore.

1555
01:27:14.411 --> 01:27:16.814
Live your life, 
Puss in Boots.

1556
01:27:16.848 --> 01:27:18.448
Live it well.

1557
01:27:21.052 --> 01:27:24.856
You know we will
meet again, right?


1558
01:27:24.889 --> 01:27:27.825
<i>Sí. Hasta la muerte.</i>

1559
01:27:39.536 --> 01:27:41.172
You know,

1560
01:27:41.205 --> 01:27:43.174
when you said
Death was after you,


1561
01:27:43.207 --> 01:27:46.443
I thought you were just
being melodramatic.


1562
01:27:47.078 --> 01:27:48.478
The wish is yours.

1563
01:27:48.511 --> 01:27:51.716
You deserve someone
you can trust.


1564
01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.655
I don't need it.

1565
01:27:57.688 --> 01:27:59.522
I've got what I wished for.

1566
01:27:59.556 --> 01:28:01.591
No magic required.

1567
01:28:11.636 --> 01:28:15.072
Ah, magic snacks.

1568
01:28:21.178 --> 01:28:22.813
Holy frijoles.

1569
01:28:22.847 --> 01:28:25.548
I was worried for a second
I would come out naked,


1570
01:28:25.582 --> 01:28:28.920
but my clothes grew, too. Cool.

1571
01:28:28.953 --> 01:28:30.955
Thank you.

1572
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:34.058
Gotcha.

1573
01:28:34.091 --> 01:28:36.193
The last wish.

1574
01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:38.696
It's mine.

1575
01:28:39.529 --> 01:28:41.598
"Star light, star bright,

1576
01:28:41.632 --> 01:28:43.834
first star I see tonight..."

1577
01:28:43.868 --> 01:28:45.535
Perrito!

1578
01:28:45.568 --> 01:28:48.673
"I wish I may, 
I wish I might

1579
01:28:48.706 --> 01:28:51.742
-have this wish..." Huh?
-Señor Horner!


1580
01:28:51.776 --> 01:28:54.745
Please don't make that wish.
Please?


1581
01:28:55.713 --> 01:28:57.081
Please?

1582
01:28:57.114 --> 01:28:58.215
Wh
-What are you doing?

1583
01:28:58.249 --> 01:29:00.550
Please...

1584
01:29:00.583 --> 01:29:02.585
Seriously, are you having
a hernia or something?


1585
01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:06.724
Pretty please...

1586
01:29:08.726 --> 01:29:11.594
They're such pools
of vulnerability.


1587
01:29:13.563 --> 01:29:15.565
It's so cute...

1588
01:29:15.598 --> 01:29:18.002
how you think
that would work on me.


1589
01:29:18.035 --> 01:29:19.704
Don't you know I'm dead inside?

1590
01:29:19.737 --> 01:29:21.906
By the way,
your nose is bleeding.


1591
01:29:21.939 --> 01:29:23.274
Oh.

1592
01:29:23.307 --> 01:29:27.011
I was just buying some time
for Team Friendship.


1593
01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:29.914
Team what?

1594
01:29:38.723 --> 01:29:40.891
Spanish Splinter!

1595
01:29:40.925 --> 01:29:43.661
Ow!

1596
01:29:46.230 --> 01:29:47.898
Hey!

1597
01:29:52.169 --> 01:29:55.605
What have you done? No!

1598
01:29:55.639 --> 01:29:57.274
The map. My wish.

1599
01:29:57.308 --> 01:29:58.709
Go, go, go!

1600
01:30:00.277 --> 01:30:01.746
Whoa!

1601
01:30:02.947 --> 01:30:04.081
It's mine.

1602
01:30:05.716 --> 01:30:06.617
Huh?

1603
01:30:06.650 --> 01:30:08.853
You looking for something?

1604
01:30:08.886 --> 01:30:11.756
Consider this
my resignation, mister.


1605
01:30:14.759 --> 01:30:15.626
What?

1606
01:30:15.659 --> 01:30:19.663
What did I do to deserve this?

1607
01:30:20.597 --> 01:30:23.801
I mean, what specifically...?

1608
01:30:33.944 --> 01:30:35.746
Gorgeous.

1609
01:30:36.781 --> 01:30:40.818
I hate to say it,
but should we make a wish?


1610
01:30:40.851 --> 01:30:44.688
Kitty, one life spent with you

1611
01:30:44.722 --> 01:30:46.957
is all that I could wish for.

1612
01:30:57.401 --> 01:30:59.837
You saved my life, sis.

1613
01:30:59.870 --> 01:31:01.839
You was gonna make the wish,
but you didn't make the wish


1614
01:31:01.872 --> 01:31:03.340
'cause you wanted
to save your family.


1615
01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:05.176
And I
-I was really scared.

1616
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:06.644
And then...

1617
01:31:06.677 --> 01:31:08.345
Oi, don't get
so blubbery about it.


1618
01:31:08.379 --> 01:31:10.081
Whose porridge would I eat
otherwise?


1619
01:31:10.114 --> 01:31:13.150
I'm sorry you didn't get
your wish, Goldi, love.


1620
01:31:13.184 --> 01:31:14.285
But I did, Mama.

1621
01:31:14.318 --> 01:31:16.253
I did get my wish.

1622
01:31:16.287 --> 01:31:18.222
Everything...

1623
01:31:18.255 --> 01:31:20.958
is just right.

1624
01:31:20.991 --> 01:31:22.093
Oh.

1625
01:31:22.126 --> 01:31:23.828
Oh, now you've made me cry.

1626
01:31:23.861 --> 01:31:25.062
Aw.

1627
01:31:25.096 --> 01:31:27.798
Now, what say we all go home
and hibernate?


1628
01:31:27.832 --> 01:31:30.734
Hey, Goldi, you are a chip
off the old block, you are.


1629
01:31:30.768 --> 01:31:33.137
Well, what can I say?

1630
01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:35.206
I won the orphan lottery.

1631
01:31:36.273 --> 01:31:38.042
Softpaws, Boots.

1632
01:31:38.075 --> 01:31:39.376
-Goldi.
-Bears.


1633
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:42.646
Hey, Baby, you got any ideas
for our next job?


1634
01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.315
Oh! Remember that pie factory?

1635
01:31:44.348 --> 01:31:46.350
I suspect that
they might be experiencing


1636
01:31:46.383 --> 01:31:47.952
a leadership vacuum.

1637
01:31:47.985 --> 01:31:49.720
Oh, family business.

1638
01:31:49.753 --> 01:31:51.255
Oh, how exciting.

1639
01:31:51.288 --> 01:31:55.025
Now's a good time to talk about
ethical business practices.


1640
01:31:55.059 --> 01:31:57.862
There's a talking
cockroach on my nose!


1641
01:31:57.895 --> 01:31:59.797
-Get it off! Get off!
-Hold still.


1642
01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:01.398
Oh, no, no, wait just a second.

1643
01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:03.767
Ow! Hey! Hang on!

1644
01:32:03.801 --> 01:32:05.669
Hey, Perrito, about that name.

1645
01:32:05.703 --> 01:32:07.138
Let's pick one out for you.

1646
01:32:07.171 --> 01:32:09.440
Yeah. Oh, what about "Chiquito"?

1647
01:32:09.473 --> 01:32:11.142
-Hmm...
-Ah. "Chomper."


1648
01:32:11.175 --> 01:32:12.376
What do you think, Perrito?

1649
01:32:12.409 --> 01:32:13.744
"Chomper," no?

1650
01:32:13.777 --> 01:32:15.112
I got it, I got it.

1651
01:32:15.146 --> 01:32:16.981
How about "Jeff"?

1652
01:32:17.014 --> 01:32:18.382
-Jeff?
-Yeah.


1653
01:32:18.415 --> 01:32:20.017
He doesn't have a Jeff's face.

1654
01:32:20.818 --> 01:32:22.753
You know,
if it's the same to you,


1655
01:32:22.786 --> 01:32:24.755
I think I'll just stick
with "Perrito."


1656
01:32:24.788 --> 01:32:26.290
I kind of like it,

1657
01:32:26.323 --> 01:32:28.192
since that's what
my friends call me.


1658
01:32:28.225 --> 01:32:31.795
Then "Perrito" it shall be.

1659
01:32:32.863 --> 01:32:34.899
You know, to be honest,
"Chomper" is pretty good.


1660
01:32:34.932 --> 01:32:36.433
Yeah, but no.

1661
01:32:36.467 --> 01:32:38.702
Well, we'll keep,
uh, workshopping it.


1662
01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:54.451
I want this vacation
to be perfect!


1663
01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:56.887
Did you remember to pack
my captain's hat?


1664
01:32:56.921 --> 01:32:58.455
Yes, Governor.

1665
01:32:58.489 --> 01:33:00.291
And your captain's shoes,
your captain's coat


1666
01:33:00.324 --> 01:33:01.792
and your captain's pajamas.

1667
01:33:01.825 --> 01:33:03.460
And what about...

1668
01:33:03.494 --> 01:33:05.462
My boat!

1669
01:33:05.496 --> 01:33:07.831
Puss in Boots!

1670
01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:15.105
Perrito!

1671
01:33:15.139 --> 01:33:16.340
Team Friendship?

1672
01:33:16.373 --> 01:33:17.908
We did not agree to this.

1673
01:33:17.942 --> 01:33:20.344
Yeah, it makes us
look ridiculous.


1674
01:33:20.377 --> 01:33:21.812
Too late now. It's official.

1675
01:33:21.845 --> 01:33:23.480
Aah! Seagull! Whoa.

1676
01:33:25.249 --> 01:33:28.085
Steady as she goes, Perrito.

1677
01:33:28.118 --> 01:33:29.353
Dokey doke.

1678
01:33:29.386 --> 01:33:30.955
Where are we headed, anyways?

1679
01:33:30.988 --> 01:33:33.824
Off to find new adventures

1680
01:33:33.857 --> 01:33:37.328
