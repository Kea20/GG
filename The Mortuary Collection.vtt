00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:35.197
The world is not made of atoms.

3
00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:39.027
It is made of stories.

4
00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:15.895
Aah!

5
00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:26.950
Hello, child.

6
00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:32.608
You've left your camera!

7
00:04:44.153 --> 00:04:46.752
Suck it, creep-o!

8
00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:04.944
Creep-o.

9
00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:06.859
That's a new one.

10
00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:24.703
What is life but a story?

11
00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:28.707
A single narrative thread
in the tapestry

12
00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.624
that binds us all.

13
00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:34.626
And as with all stories,

14
00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:39.065
it is not the length
of the tale that resonates,

15
00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:43.853
it is the quality
of the content within.

16
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:47.770
I beseech you, friends,
that even as we mourn,

17
00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:54.603
let us celebrate as a tribute
to this young man's story.

18
00:05:54.615 --> 00:05:58.215
Let us seek solace that
we have been granted impunity

19
00:05:58.227 --> 00:06:00.217
from eternal rest.

20
00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.785
That death would not
eradicate us,

21
00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:07.137
but in the pages of life
we will continue forth

22
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:11.010
and we cannot die!

23
00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:26.199
Uh, and now a reading
from Corinthians.

24
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:28.637
Thank you for coming.

25
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:32.423
Please drive safely.

26
00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:34.991
Sorry for your loss.

27
00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:37.167
Thank you for coming.

28
00:07:58.216 --> 00:08:02.208
I wouldn't.

29
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.733
This world,
this business,

30
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:09.401
it's not as neat and tidy
as one might expect.

31
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:17.485
The coffin...
It's so small.

32
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.096
A tragic thing,
indeed.

33
00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:24.274
Montgomery Dark,
resident mortician,

34
00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:26.711
indentured servant
to the great beyond.

35
00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:28.844
Dark. Really?

36
00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:30.106
Mm.

37
00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:34.197
It's a family name.

38
00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:37.417
Oh, I'm Sam.

39
00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.332
Sam.

40
00:08:39.344 --> 00:08:41.117
My condolences.

41
00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:43.293
Were you close with the child?

42
00:08:43.305 --> 00:08:47.993
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
I saw a sign out front.

43
00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:50.256
Sign?

44
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:53.608
Yeah, "Help wanted."

45
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.089
Are you still looking?

46
00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:59.178
Yes.

47
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.662
Always.

48
00:09:04.674 --> 00:09:06.838
Please.

49
00:09:15.642 --> 00:09:19.808
Have you any experience
in the mortuary arts?

50
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.811
No, but I'm a fast learner.

51
00:09:22.823 --> 00:09:26.858
Mm, most people would
find it unmanageable.

52
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.469
Huh.
I'm not most people.

53
00:09:29.481 --> 00:09:31.341
We shall see.

54
00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:34.823
Please have a seat.

55
00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:38.043
This is... This is
one serious collection of books

56
00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:39.349
you've got here.

57
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:40.872
The mere tip of the looming,

58
00:09:40.884 --> 00:09:44.049
lumbering iceberg,
I'm afraid...

59
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:46.791
An archive of the various ways
in which clients

60
00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:51.361
have found themselves passing
through our hallowed halls.

61
00:09:51.373 --> 00:09:55.147
So, these are all stories
about how people died?

62
00:09:55.159 --> 00:10:00.457
Not just how,
my dear, why.

63
00:10:00.469 --> 00:10:03.329
Huh.
That's pretty cool.

64
00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:06.245
Yes, it is, isn't it?

65
00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:19.868
Tell me one.

66
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.481
Tell you one what? A story.

67
00:10:24.493 --> 00:10:27.919
Something...
dark and twisted.

68
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:30.574
Something awesome.

69
00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:34.230
Mm. Perhaps we should
stick to business.

70
00:10:34.242 --> 00:10:35.840
We have much to do.

71
00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:37.363
Oh, come on, Monty.
If I'm going to be working here,

72
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:39.061
I need to know what
I'm getting myself into.

73
00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:42.642
You are not hired yet,
young lady.

74
00:10:44.948 --> 00:10:47.112
Right because you have
a stack of applications

75
00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:48.636
to go through.

76
00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:04.390
Something dark,
twisted, and "awesome," eh?

77
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.309
Well, see how
this one grabs you.

78
00:11:30.037 --> 00:11:33.028
Uh, someone's in here.

79
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.595
Hoping you're
not trying to hide from me.

80
00:11:35.607 --> 00:11:37.467
I wouldn't dream of it.

81
00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:38.816
Okay.

82
00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:42.777
Meet me on the veranda in 10?

83
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:45.431
Look, I've just got to say that
talking with you back there,

84
00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:48.565
I felt this connection, and
I feel like you felt it, too.

85
00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:50.219
A-Am I being crazy?

86
00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:54.658
I'm being crazy.
I'll see you on the veranda.

87
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.189
Ahh.

88
00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:20.831
Okay.

89
00:13:52.657 --> 00:13:53.995
Okay.

90
00:13:54.007 --> 00:13:56.345
Ahh!

91
00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:58.838
Damn it.

92
00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:34.470
Aaaah!

93
00:14:56.983 --> 00:15:01.192
Can somebody help me?

94
00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:03.368
Help me, please!

95
00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:10.958
Aaaaah!

96
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:43.437
It's not bad.

97
00:16:45.787 --> 00:16:49.170
I was expecting something
a bit more substantial.

98
00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:52.912
Maybe an ironic comeuppance
or a big twist, but...

99
00:16:52.924 --> 00:16:54.883
it was fun.

100
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.354
Fun?

101
00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:01.225
Well, I have more stories.

102
00:17:01.237 --> 00:17:03.662
Many, many more.

103
00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:07.405
I was...
just warming up.

104
00:17:07.417 --> 00:17:09.886
Here.

105
00:17:09.898 --> 00:17:13.162
Sign here,
initial here and here.

106
00:17:15.382 --> 00:17:18.590
It's a bit far-fetched,
don't you think,

107
00:17:18.602 --> 00:17:20.505
an octopus
in a medicine cabinet?

108
00:17:20.517 --> 00:17:22.725
It was not an octopus.

109
00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:24.379
And.

110
00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:26.250
It is not the validity
of the story

111
00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:29.471
that concerns me,
but the message within.

112
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:31.777
And the message is...

113
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:34.780
don't stick you nose
where it doesn't belong?

114
00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:38.871
In a most basic sense, yes.

115
00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:42.092
But on a deeper level,

116
00:17:42.104 --> 00:17:47.358
it is about the universal
balance of all things.

117
00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:52.102
Universal balance?

118
00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:00.850
There we are...
Nice and neat.

119
00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:02.808
Shall we begin?

120
00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:15.691
The foyer, French for
where the fire is kept.

121
00:18:15.703 --> 00:18:18.563
Oh, who are these ghouls?

122
00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:21.523
Ghouls?

123
00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.916
These are morticians,
my dear,

124
00:18:23.928 --> 00:18:27.485
some of whom were called
to serve in this very house.

125
00:18:27.497 --> 00:18:31.141
A distinguished group,
to be sure.

126
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:35.145
Yeah, distinguished.

127
00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:38.714
Come.
There's much to see.

128
00:18:44.384 --> 00:18:48.506
Of course, you've already seen
the viewing parlor.

129
00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:51.161
Very elementary.

130
00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:53.511
The mourning sit here

131
00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:58.516
and up here
resides the rhapsodist.

132
00:18:58.528 --> 00:19:00.910
How old are you?

133
00:19:00.922 --> 00:19:04.566
Ironic, is it not,
that one so old would preside

134
00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:08.657
over the passing
of one so young.

135
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:11.660
So, what is the story here?

136
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.623
I would rather not.

137
00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:22.944
Some tales even I find
too unsettling to recount.

138
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.328
Tell me another one, then.

139
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.244
You say you have better stories.

140
00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:31.941
I want to hear them.

141
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.821
You've heard the phrase,
"better safe than sorry,"

142
00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:44.780
I presume?

143
00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:48.784
Well, this young man
had to learn it the hard way.

144
00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:54.920
Karl Marx said that
social progress can be measured

145
00:19:54.932 --> 00:19:58.010
by the social position
of the female sex.

146
00:19:58.022 --> 00:20:01.057
Now, ladies,
as a straight, white male,

147
00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:04.365
I'm going to be the first
to admit the tides are turning.

148
00:20:04.377 --> 00:20:06.845
The patriarchy is falling,
and in its place

149
00:20:06.857 --> 00:20:10.327
is a brave, new world
of equality and sexual freedom.

150
00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:13.722
A world where both men and women
are entitled to have sex

151
00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:16.246
whenever and with
whoever they please

152
00:20:16.258 --> 00:20:24.258
as long as they do so safely
and with the proper protection.

153
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.302
Just... like... that.

154
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.307
You're empowered.

155
00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:36.223
Please, have some condoms.

156
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.703
Guys, listen...
We are having a party tonight

157
00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:43.099
at the Sig Delt house.
You should stop by.

158
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:46.711
Okay?

159
00:20:46.723 --> 00:20:50.454
So... is that true
about the patriarchy?

160
00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:54.806
No, idiot.
Patriarchy is solid.

161
00:20:54.818 --> 00:20:56.199
Karl Marx said that...

162
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.332
You don't even know
who Karl Marx is.

163
00:20:58.344 --> 00:21:00.116
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

164
00:21:00.128 --> 00:21:02.031
Yes, I do.

165
00:21:02.043 --> 00:21:04.599
Jakey, can you please tell me
what we're doing here?

166
00:21:04.611 --> 00:21:08.472
We are providing an important
service to the incoming freshmen

167
00:21:08.484 --> 00:21:12.868
who are young, impressionable,
and vulnerable.

168
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.176
Guys, it is our job to help them
make informed decisions.

169
00:21:19.582 --> 00:21:22.225
And that decision is to have sex

170
00:21:22.237 --> 00:21:24.445
with you hopeless jerks
at the party tonight.

171
00:21:24.457 --> 00:21:28.971
A-And what, the girls
who take the condoms

172
00:21:28.983 --> 00:21:31.713
are the ones who want to party.

173
00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:32.541
Oh!

174
00:21:32.553 --> 00:21:36.065
And party means sex.

175
00:21:36.077 --> 00:21:38.241
Anyone want condoms?!

176
00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:40.635
Condoms suck.

177
00:22:06.542 --> 00:22:08.140
Uh, hey!
Miss!

178
00:22:08.152 --> 00:22:09.577
Hey, excuse me,
Miss!

179
00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:11.318
Oh, Miss.
Hey! Can I...

180
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.755
Hey, I was just wondering

181
00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:16.584
if I can offer you
a, uh, prophylactic?

182
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:17.759
I'm sorry?

183
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:20.196
Um, uh,
it's slang for a condom.

184
00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:23.634
We're giving them away to show
how the patriarchy is dying.

185
00:22:23.646 --> 00:22:26.681
You know,
it's almost dead.

186
00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:29.727
I mean,
we're white guys and...

187
00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:31.468
Do you know who Karl Marx is

188
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.514
'cause he would want you
to have one?

189
00:22:33.526 --> 00:22:35.037
Uh, thanks.

190
00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:36.647
No problem.

191
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:37.996
Uh, just one
'cause we've got plenty,

192
00:22:38.008 --> 00:22:39.650
and they're all free. Hey, buddy.

193
00:22:39.662 --> 00:22:41.435
Hi.
Hi.

194
00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:44.568
So, um, the girls lacrosse team
just showed up at the booth,

195
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.528
and, um...
we're out of bananas.

196
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.225
Wha... Like,
the lacrosse team?

197
00:22:49.237 --> 00:22:50.792
The girls lacrosse team.

198
00:22:50.804 --> 00:22:53.795
That's like the fastest sport
on two feet.

199
00:22:53.807 --> 00:22:57.407
You got this?

200
00:22:57.419 --> 00:22:59.366
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll do my best.

201
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:01.031
Okay.
Okay.

202
00:23:04.905 --> 00:23:08.026
Uh, yeah, we don't have
a girls lacrosse team.

203
00:23:08.038 --> 00:23:10.377
I'm Jake.
Uh, Sandra.

204
00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:13.380
You don't look like a freshman.

205
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:15.120
No. It's 'cause
I'm not.

206
00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:17.688
I just come to these things
to get laid.

207
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.299
Oh, me too.

208
00:23:20.311 --> 00:23:22.867
What?
I w...

209
00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:25.522
I was...
I-I'm joking.

210
00:23:25.534 --> 00:23:28.525
I-I'm working at
the stay safe booth over there.

211
00:23:28.537 --> 00:23:31.746
I-I'm just trying to give back.

212
00:23:31.758 --> 00:23:32.790
I don't know.
I'm just doing my part.

213
00:23:32.802 --> 00:23:36.011
I like that.

214
00:23:36.023 --> 00:23:37.708
Hey, uh, Jake!

215
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.710
Could I just borrow you
for one second?

216
00:23:39.722 --> 00:23:42.974
Yeah.

217
00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:45.455
I'm so sorry.

218
00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:48.719
I got to go, but,
um, yeah.

219
00:23:48.731 --> 00:23:50.994
It was a... It was a pleasure
meeting you, Sandra.

220
00:23:56.217 --> 00:23:58.294
You know, um...
there's a party tonight

221
00:23:58.306 --> 00:23:59.991
at the Sig Delt house.

222
00:24:00.003 --> 00:24:01.558
We're throwing it.

223
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:05.040
Uh, it's probably going to be
fun, so you should come.

224
00:24:05.052 --> 00:24:08.043
Yeah. Maybe.

225
00:24:08.055 --> 00:24:10.741
Maybe?

226
00:24:10.753 --> 00:24:13.265
Yeah, maybe is, uh...
Maybe's great.

227
00:24:13.277 --> 00:24:16.977
Okay, well, uh, maybe
I'll see you there.

228
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:52.566
Uh, hang on!

229
00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:57.048
Yep!

230
00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.224
Yeah!

231
00:24:59.236 --> 00:25:01.052
Did you want
some liquid courage?

232
00:25:01.064 --> 00:25:02.489
Hmm? No.

233
00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:05.883
Okay. Uh, bottoms up!

234
00:25:10.944 --> 00:25:12.977
Something wrong? You've kind of
been acting a little weird

235
00:25:12.989 --> 00:25:14.762
ever since this morning?

236
00:25:14.774 --> 00:25:18.766
No, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...
yeah, I'm just laying low.

237
00:25:18.778 --> 00:25:20.550
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

238
00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:22.247
I'm laying low, too.

239
00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:24.380
You know, just laying real low
'cause I'm cool.

240
00:25:24.392 --> 00:25:26.121
We're cool.

241
00:25:26.133 --> 00:25:27.775
Oh, is that girl coming?

242
00:25:27.787 --> 00:25:29.646
What?

243
00:25:29.658 --> 00:25:31.430
The girl from this morning.

244
00:25:31.442 --> 00:25:33.781
I don't know, maybe.

245
00:25:33.793 --> 00:25:37.306
Cool. Maybe, who cares?
Whatever. You know.

246
00:25:37.318 --> 00:25:39.177
Whoa!
Hey, what is that?

247
00:25:39.189 --> 00:25:40.744
No! No! No!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

248
00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:43.312
Oh, you dog!

249
00:25:43.324 --> 00:25:45.227
What?
Jenny Si...

250
00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:48.360
Jenny Simon, the head
of the history department?!

251
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:52.451
Yeah, I had to brush up
on the cultural relevance

252
00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:54.323
of Mesopotamia
in the 21st century.

253
00:25:54.335 --> 00:25:56.107
How do you do it?

254
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:57.979
I mean, you look good.
That's a given.

255
00:25:57.991 --> 00:25:59.546
There's something else.
It's...

256
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:04.333
Carter, girls aren't
some complex puzzle

257
00:26:04.345 --> 00:26:05.595
that need to be solved.

258
00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:07.075
They're the same as you and me.

259
00:26:07.087 --> 00:26:08.511
They want the same things.

260
00:26:08.523 --> 00:26:14.517
They... They want sex and...
And a companion.

261
00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:16.301
I mean, like everybody,

262
00:26:16.313 --> 00:26:20.175
they just... want to feel
like they're worth it.

263
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:26.137
Look, if you can give
a girl that,

264
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:29.097
even if it's just
for one night...

265
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:33.710
you can have any girl
that you want.

266
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:36.234
Look alive,
Sig Delts!

267
00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:40.630
I am a robot,
and this is my fuel.

268
00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:43.502
Aah!
Let's do it!

269
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.718
Hey, haven't you heard
about all of those missing guys?

270
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.154
What guys are you talking about?

271
00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:55.722
Yeah, there's fliers
all over campus.

272
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:58.115
Oh, yeah. Yeah, those guys,
that's terribly sad.

273
00:28:58.127 --> 00:28:59.508
It's heartbreaking.

274
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.902
Aren't you worried
about your safety?

275
00:29:01.914 --> 00:29:04.600
I mean,
you barely know me.

276
00:29:04.612 --> 00:29:08.386
I could be...
a serial killer.

277
00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:15.089
Are you?

278
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:09.360
I have something for you.

279
00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:12.581
Oh, yeah?
What is it?

280
00:30:26.781 --> 00:30:31.034
Oh, great.
That's...

281
00:30:31.046 --> 00:30:37.171
Yeah, you know, uh, I don't need
one of these, right?

282
00:30:37.183 --> 00:30:42.132
Yeah but I want to be empowered.

283
00:30:42.144 --> 00:30:45.353
Yeah.

284
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:48.835
Absolutely.
Empowered.

285
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:53.317
Just placing it over and...

286
00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:55.972
Okay.

287
00:31:05.124 --> 00:31:07.418
Turn over.

288
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:10.160
What? Turn over!

289
00:32:48.879 --> 00:32:50.957
Hey, good morning!

290
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:52.480
How did it go last night?

291
00:32:52.492 --> 00:32:53.395
As expected.

292
00:32:53.407 --> 00:32:55.657
Oh, yeah!

293
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:59.226
Yeah, so, that's like,
number 67, right?

294
00:32:59.238 --> 00:33:02.403
It's really weird
that you know that.

295
00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:07.712
Hey, uh, did you... did you
forget to wear a condom?

296
00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:10.106
You know, maybe, uh,
maybe she had

297
00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:11.542
poison ivy or something.

298
00:33:13.382 --> 00:33:16.156
It's probably
just from friction.

299
00:33:16.168 --> 00:33:18.071
Mm, well, either way,

300
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:19.724
you probably should
get that checked out.

301
00:33:19.736 --> 00:33:21.248
Uh, it's fine.

302
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.771
Okay.
Okay.

303
00:33:22.783 --> 00:33:24.338
You know better than me.

304
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.035
Yes I do.
Yeah, you do.

305
00:33:26.047 --> 00:33:30.779
Okay. I'll see you later
'cause I got some things to do.

306
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:44.401
Son of a bitch.

307
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:03.942
So, you got a case
of the cooties, did ya?

308
00:34:03.954 --> 00:34:07.424
Um, c-come here.

309
00:34:07.436 --> 00:34:10.558
You know,
I think it's one of...

310
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:14.301
Mm. You think
it's this one? Yeah.

311
00:34:14.313 --> 00:34:16.520
Well, if it's this one...

312
00:34:16.532 --> 00:34:19.480
we're gonna have to amputate.

313
00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:22.309
W-What?

314
00:34:22.321 --> 00:34:25.051
I'm just screwing with you, kid.

315
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:28.141
They won't let me near a scalpel
and... for good reason.

316
00:34:28.153 --> 00:34:30.186
No, I'm sure it's nothing

317
00:34:30.198 --> 00:34:34.147
a good ol' fashioned dose
of penicillin won't clear up.

318
00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.366
Let's just take a look
at your labs here.

319
00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:38.064
Okay.

320
00:34:40.426 --> 00:34:43.417
Wait a second.

321
00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.027
What's wrong?

322
00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:47.769
Must be... Ah, this must be
some sort of a mix up.

323
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:49.510
Just lay down on this table
for me, will ya?

324
00:34:49.522 --> 00:34:50.946
What do you mean a mix up?

325
00:34:50.958 --> 00:34:52.730
We'll get to that in a second.
Just lay down.

326
00:34:52.742 --> 00:34:54.689
I wanna... Something.

327
00:34:54.701 --> 00:34:56.995
Yeah, just relax.

328
00:34:57.007 --> 00:35:00.216
Take a deep breath in.

329
00:35:00.228 --> 00:35:01.870
Good, again.

330
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:17.277
What the hell?

331
00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:19.714
What? What?
What's wrong?

332
00:35:19.726 --> 00:35:22.195
Wha... Wha...

333
00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:25.546
Um... no,
everything's... fine.

334
00:35:25.558 --> 00:35:28.636
I'm just gonna... go check
on something really quick.

335
00:35:28.648 --> 00:35:31.247
You just stay put.

336
00:35:31.259 --> 00:35:32.770
I'll be right back.

337
00:35:32.782 --> 00:35:34.337
No. No. No. No.I'll be right back!

338
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:36.383
What do... What do you
have to go check on?

339
00:36:58.912 --> 00:37:01.468
523...

340
00:37:05.875 --> 00:37:08.431
This is Telecom Industries.
Can I help you?

341
00:37:08.443 --> 00:37:10.564
Hello?

342
00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:21.749
No!

343
00:37:25.504 --> 00:37:27.145
Please. Please. Please. Please.
Please. Please.

344
00:37:27.157 --> 00:37:29.974
Hello? Hi, Sandra?

345
00:37:29.986 --> 00:37:32.499
Yeah? It's Jake. What's up?

346
00:37:32.511 --> 00:37:35.197
Jake?

347
00:37:35.209 --> 00:37:38.809
Yeah, from, uh... from the party
last night, remember?

348
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:42.030
We, um... We hung out.

349
00:37:42.042 --> 00:37:44.815
Oh, hey. What's up?

350
00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:46.469
Not much.
Not much at all.

351
00:37:46.481 --> 00:37:49.167
I just, um... I've got
the afternoon...

352
00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:51.039
...off,

353
00:37:51.051 --> 00:37:54.085
and I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to hang out?

354
00:37:54.097 --> 00:37:55.435
Yeah, okay.

355
00:37:55.447 --> 00:37:58.046
Okay. Okay, yeah.
Yeah, that's great.

356
00:37:58.058 --> 00:38:02.833
Um... what's
your address?

357
00:38:17.686 --> 00:38:22.288
No. No. No. No.

358
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.202
Welcome, brother.

359
00:38:27.217 --> 00:38:30.687
It was our forefather,
Ezekiel Durkas, who wrote...

360
00:38:30.699 --> 00:38:32.515
Durkas wrote.

361
00:38:32.527 --> 00:38:36.737
That a man can measure his worth
by the notches on his bedpost.

362
00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:40.262
Each groove represents
not only a conquest for himself,

363
00:38:40.274 --> 00:38:43.047
but for the brotherhood
as a whole.

364
00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:45.572
The honor is ours to share.

365
00:38:45.584 --> 00:38:48.314
It was recently
brought to my attention

366
00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:51.578
that Jake of the family Matthews

367
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:55.364
has reached
the sacred number 67.

368
00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:57.323
No. No. No.
Put it back.

369
00:38:57.335 --> 00:39:00.456
A holy number which represents
the 67 founders

370
00:39:00.468 --> 00:39:02.676
of our great fraternity

371
00:39:02.688 --> 00:39:04.591
and is honored
with the 67 cherry trees

372
00:39:04.603 --> 00:39:06.941
spread across this great land.

373
00:39:06.953 --> 00:39:14.252
67 cherries for Sig Delt and
67 cherries for Brother Matthew.

374
00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:16.037
You got to sit down. I don't want to sit!

375
00:39:16.049 --> 00:39:18.256
It's tradition!
Come on.

376
00:39:18.268 --> 00:39:21.042
You, sir, are bronze.

377
00:39:21.054 --> 00:39:24.654
Come on.
Give me your keys.

378
00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:29.093
I am so proud of you, man.

379
00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:33.054
Brother Matthews,
as is your right,

380
00:39:33.066 --> 00:39:36.492
you may now hang your name
on the sacred mantel.

381
00:39:36.504 --> 00:39:39.147
Great.
Thank you, Todd.

382
00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:47.982
No. No. No.

383
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:54.423
No. No. No. No.

384
00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:01.474
We're gonna need more.

385
00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:32.853
Aah!

386
00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:56.703
Keys.
Give me the keys.

387
00:41:20.303 --> 00:41:24.078
Hey!
Can I help you?

388
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:28.909
Uh, I-I'm looking for Sandra.

389
00:41:42.456 --> 00:41:46.187
Sandra Patricia Marie,
get downstairs now!

390
00:41:52.945 --> 00:41:56.284
Oh, God!

391
00:41:56.296 --> 00:41:57.633
God! God! God!

392
00:41:57.645 --> 00:41:58.895
Oh! Oh, God!

393
00:41:58.907 --> 00:42:02.464
Okay.
It's perfectly natural.

394
00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:04.814
Natural?

395
00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:07.730
Are you kidding me?

396
00:42:07.742 --> 00:42:11.604
In what world is this natural?!

397
00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:17.697
You!

398
00:42:17.709 --> 00:42:18.959
What did you do to me?!

399
00:42:18.971 --> 00:42:20.961
What did I do to you?

400
00:42:20.973 --> 00:42:23.398
I thought you wore protection.

401
00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:26.270
Um... I...

402
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.233
I-I did...
I didn't.

403
00:42:32.245 --> 00:42:35.758
I'm sorry.

404
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.239
You got...
You got to understand.

405
00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:40.807
I-I used to be fat.

406
00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:44.680
Like, I was like,
really, really fat.

407
00:42:44.692 --> 00:42:46.247
Like, kids would pick on me.

408
00:42:46.259 --> 00:42:48.379
They... They'd throw stuff
at me, okay?

409
00:42:48.391 --> 00:42:51.165
Girls... Girls like you
wouldn't even look at me...

410
00:42:51.177 --> 00:42:52.949
until the day
that I made a decision

411
00:42:52.961 --> 00:42:55.169
that I was going
to change myself.

412
00:42:55.181 --> 00:42:57.345
And then things got better.

413
00:42:57.357 --> 00:43:01.001
Okay, they got better,
and I got worse.

414
00:43:01.013 --> 00:43:06.223
Look at me.
I'm hideous.

415
00:43:06.235 --> 00:43:09.662
I'm a monster.

416
00:43:09.674 --> 00:43:13.404
And I'm <i>fat</i> again!

417
00:43:21.947 --> 00:43:24.154
Sandra where are you going?

418
00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:29.116
Where are you...

419
00:43:29.128 --> 00:43:32.772
Hey. Looks like
I'm free after all.

420
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.516
It's nearly there.
Big breath.

421
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.007
I got a question for you.

422
00:43:51.019 --> 00:43:53.880
How is this going to work?
Where is it going to come out?

423
00:43:53.892 --> 00:43:57.144
Uh, well, uh...

424
00:43:57.156 --> 00:44:00.016
It's going to come out
the same it got in.

425
00:44:23.748 --> 00:44:25.651
You got a blanket?

426
00:45:18.933 --> 00:45:20.488
<i>That</i> was a story.

427
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.708
Ah, you mean it? Absolutely.

428
00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:26.886
There was romance,
suspense,

429
00:45:26.898 --> 00:45:28.975
horror,
social commentary.

430
00:45:28.987 --> 00:45:30.454
I mean it was...

431
00:45:30.466 --> 00:45:33.501
It was everything
a story should be and more.

432
00:45:33.513 --> 00:45:37.026
Now you're being glib
aren't you?

433
00:45:37.038 --> 00:45:39.028
Only a little.

434
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:55.175
Wait here.

435
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:03.487
Don't touch anything.

436
00:46:45.019 --> 00:46:48.184
Impressive,
isn't it?

437
00:46:48.196 --> 00:46:50.056
Be careful.

438
00:46:50.068 --> 00:46:52.928
I wouldn't want you
to take a tumble.

439
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:57.803
Shall we continue?

440
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.611
This house was built with all
the modern conveniences...

441
00:47:17.573 --> 00:47:20.216
...of 1825.

442
00:47:28.149 --> 00:47:30.748
Coming?

443
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.926
The embalming room.

444
00:47:33.938 --> 00:47:38.278
This is where the sausage
is made, so to speak.

445
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.410
Hm.

446
00:47:40.422 --> 00:47:43.544
Every corpse tells a story.

447
00:47:43.556 --> 00:47:48.723
It is our task to listen
to uncover the clues

448
00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:51.160
and extract the truth.

449
00:47:51.172 --> 00:47:54.685
Looks like you're extracting
a little more than just truth.

450
00:47:54.697 --> 00:47:59.212
Care to give this one a try?

451
00:48:01.269 --> 00:48:04.217
Wow, she looks...
perfect.

452
00:48:04.229 --> 00:48:08.177
Look closer.
The devil is in the detail.

453
00:48:08.189 --> 00:48:12.747
Here.
See this mark?

454
00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:15.271
Ugh.

455
00:48:15.283 --> 00:48:19.797
The bed sore... very unusual
in one so young.

456
00:48:19.809 --> 00:48:23.105
And if we examine
the upper palate,

457
00:48:23.117 --> 00:48:26.195
we will find traces
of magnesium,

458
00:48:26.207 --> 00:48:28.894
an essential element
used to treat patients

459
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:32.462
in perpetual catatonic states.

460
00:48:32.474 --> 00:48:36.597
Oh, and she was married.

461
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:39.426
Indeed.

462
00:48:39.438 --> 00:48:40.439
Is there an inscription?

463
00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:46.172
"Till death do us part."

464
00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:50.698
Oh, how...
predictable.

465
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:55.268
"Till death do us part."

466
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.837
But what if even death
provides no reprieve?

467
00:49:27.051 --> 00:49:31.391
Do you, Carol Peters,
take Wendell Owens

468
00:49:31.403 --> 00:49:35.047
to be your husband
to have and to hold

469
00:49:35.059 --> 00:49:39.573
in sickness and in health,
till do you part?

470
00:49:39.585 --> 00:49:41.967
I do.

471
00:49:48.942 --> 00:49:51.193
And do you,
Wendell Owens,

472
00:49:51.205 --> 00:49:55.110
take Carol Peters
to be your wife

473
00:49:55.122 --> 00:50:00.246
to have and to hold
in sickness and in health

474
00:50:00.258 --> 00:50:05.686
till death do you part?

475
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.030
Aaah!

476
00:50:49.742 --> 00:50:54.660
Hey. Hey.

477
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.185
Yes?

478
00:51:53.197 --> 00:51:56.188
Hi. Uh, can you buzz me in?
I forgot my keys.

479
00:51:57.984 --> 00:52:00.540
Sorry, what? Huh?

480
00:52:00.552 --> 00:52:03.195
C-Can you... Can you buzz me
into the building?

481
00:52:03.207 --> 00:52:05.078
Thank you.

482
00:52:11.911 --> 00:52:14.423
Hey, old timer.

483
00:52:14.435 --> 00:52:17.078
Hey, Miss Avery,
how are you?

484
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.125
Look at all that food.
Special occasion?

485
00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:22.475
Yeah, something like that.

486
00:52:22.487 --> 00:52:24.825
I'll get that for you. I love a good meal.

487
00:52:24.837 --> 00:52:26.653
My girlfriends and I
went on this

488
00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:30.178
all-inclusive cruise
last spring. Uh-huh?

489
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:33.747
Have you ever been on one
of those all-inclusive cruises?

490
00:52:33.759 --> 00:52:37.272
No, I... I take care of Carol.

491
00:52:37.284 --> 00:52:38.926
Oh, you got to go.

492
00:52:38.938 --> 00:52:43.060
All the food you can eat,
and it's all free.

493
00:52:43.072 --> 00:52:45.411
That's the all-inclusive part.

494
00:52:47.425 --> 00:52:51.243
When Arthur was alive,
we never went anywhere,

495
00:52:51.255 --> 00:52:55.160
but now that he's gone,
I am seeing the world.

496
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:58.032
That does sound nice. Are you coming?

497
00:52:58.044 --> 00:53:03.385
Uh, no, I don't like elevators,
especially this one.

498
00:53:03.397 --> 00:53:04.257
I'm going to take the stairs.

499
00:53:04.269 --> 00:53:06.562
12 stories at your age?

500
00:53:06.574 --> 00:53:08.738
How old do you think I am?

501
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.698
I get it.
Got to stay in shape.

502
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.700
I'm going to Cancun
this Christmas.

503
00:53:13.712 --> 00:53:16.746
Uh-huh. They have nude beaches.

504
00:53:16.758 --> 00:53:18.444
Neat.

505
00:53:18.456 --> 00:53:20.881
Yeah.
Tell Carol I said...

506
00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:52.391
<i>It's spring time in Raven's
End, and love is in the air.</i>

507
00:53:52.403 --> 00:53:54.610
<i>Stay tuned for
the local forecast</i>

508
00:53:54.622 --> 00:53:58.571
<i>where things are going
to get... foggy.</i>

509
00:54:25.653 --> 00:54:27.339
<i>It's summer.
The locals are wondering</i>

510
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:29.036
<i>if they will ever see the sun.</i>

511
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.832
<i>Bundle up, Raven's End.
Fall is in the air.</i>

512
00:54:55.814 --> 00:54:57.381
What was that?

513
00:55:02.386 --> 00:55:03.386
Carol?

514
00:55:09.131 --> 00:55:11.034
It's fine.

515
00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:35.450
So, you, uh, ever thing about
taking some of these walls out?

516
00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:39.019
Giving yourself
more of a open floor plan?

517
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:41.151
How's she doing?

518
00:55:41.163 --> 00:55:45.068
Uh, she's...
She's doing well.

519
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.767
She's... well?

520
00:55:47.779 --> 00:55:49.551
How can that be?

521
00:55:49.563 --> 00:55:51.161
Yeah, I know.
It's hard to believe.

522
00:55:51.173 --> 00:55:52.511
But you know her...
She's a fighter.

523
00:55:52.523 --> 00:55:54.426
Her vitals are solid.

524
00:55:54.438 --> 00:55:56.123
I'd keep an eye
on her bed sores...

525
00:55:56.135 --> 00:55:59.822
Sorry.
Uh, she's improving?

526
00:55:59.834 --> 00:56:01.998
No, that's not what I said.

527
00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:06.829
She's... stabilized.

528
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:09.397
So how much time does she have?
What are we talking?

529
00:56:09.409 --> 00:56:12.966
Uh, it's...
It's kind of tough to say.

530
00:56:12.978 --> 00:56:16.448
Um, at this rate...

531
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:21.278
another year,
possibly more.

532
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.803
A year?

533
00:56:23.815 --> 00:56:25.848
Yeah.

534
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.460
Possibly more.

535
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:34.117
How am I supposed
to make this work?

536
00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:41.473
Al we have is... is bills
and bed pans

537
00:56:41.485 --> 00:56:45.085
and vacant,
empty stares.

538
00:56:47.447 --> 00:56:51.874
I just can't do this anymore.

539
00:56:53.497 --> 00:56:58.359
I might have something
that could help.

540
00:56:58.371 --> 00:57:02.624
It's a pain medication,
but it's... it's very strong.

541
00:57:02.636 --> 00:57:05.801
If Carol were to take
more than two of these

542
00:57:05.813 --> 00:57:09.283
in a 24-hour period,
the results could be disastrous.

543
00:57:09.295 --> 00:57:14.331
Great. I will
add it to the rest.

544
00:57:14.343 --> 00:57:16.812
You understand what
I'm telling you, Wendell?

545
00:57:16.824 --> 00:57:18.727
What?

546
00:57:18.739 --> 00:57:22.165
Those pills right there...
they don't leave a trace,

547
00:57:22.177 --> 00:57:23.819
so it would be impossible
for someone

548
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:25.517
to determine
if she took too much.

549
00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:28.433
She would just drift off
to sleep, not wake up.

550
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:31.697
Oh.
Yeah, "oh."

551
00:57:55.776 --> 00:57:58.375
You look really nice tonight.

552
00:58:01.695 --> 00:58:03.555
Mm.

553
00:58:06.613 --> 00:58:09.038
I got something for you.

554
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:11.563
It's a surprise.

555
00:58:18.146 --> 00:58:20.876
Here.
I'll open it for you.

556
00:58:23.325 --> 00:58:26.795
That is an Arctic hare.

557
00:58:26.807 --> 00:58:30.146
It's pretty creepy, right?

558
00:58:30.158 --> 00:58:32.801
Sorry.

559
00:58:32.813 --> 00:58:35.587
I know they used
to cheer you up.

560
00:58:41.866 --> 00:58:46.685
Carol I need you to...
do something for me.

561
00:58:46.697 --> 00:58:49.731
'Cause I can't do
this alone anymore.

562
00:58:53.355 --> 00:58:56.172
Can you give me a sign
that you are there?

563
00:58:59.274 --> 00:59:01.526
Please?

564
00:59:10.416 --> 00:59:12.853
Do it right now.

565
00:59:16.596 --> 00:59:18.163
Right now.

566
00:59:21.862 --> 00:59:25.941
Now!

567
00:59:25.953 --> 00:59:28.857
I'm sorry.

568
01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:08.244
Here we go.

569
01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:37.534
That's it. You're all done.
You're all done.

570
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.517
Carol?

571
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.788
No! Oh, no!

572
01:01:16.803 --> 01:01:19.576
Carol come on!

573
01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:22.231
Get it up!
Come on!

574
01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.630
I'm so sorry.

575
01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:44.732
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

576
01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.691
Honey?

577
01:01:50.141 --> 01:01:52.131
Aah!

578
01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:22.552
Kubler residence.

579
01:02:22.564 --> 01:02:27.340
She fell on an Arctic hare,
and, um, there's a lot of blood

580
01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:29.429
and, uh, I don't know
what to do.

581
01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:31.431
An Arctic hare?
What are you talking about?

582
01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:34.216
I gave her the pills,
alright?!

583
01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.870
And then she moved.

584
01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:38.046
And she grabbed my arm,
and I turned her over.

585
01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:40.832
She moved? Yes, she moved!

586
01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:43.008
Okay?!
Now she's dead.

587
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.532
She's really, really dead,
and I don't know what to do!

588
01:02:45.544 --> 01:02:49.231
What do I do?!

589
01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:50.798
Help!

590
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.844
You got to get that body
out of your apartment.

591
01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:55.672
Toss it in the ocean
and pray the sharks do the rest.

592
01:02:55.684 --> 01:02:58.371
What? Just do it!
Don't call back.

593
01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:39.428
Ugh.

594
01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:24.909
Aah!

595
01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:19.240
Hey, buddy,
hold the elevator for me.

596
01:07:19.252 --> 01:07:21.286
- Thank you a million.
- Yeah.

597
01:07:25.476 --> 01:07:27.118
Hey, I said, hold it!

598
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.207
We don't want to wait
20 minutes for the next one!

599
01:07:29.219 --> 01:07:32.210
Hold the elevator! I'm sorry.

600
01:08:46.861 --> 01:08:48.286
Aah!

601
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:52.420
Aah!

602
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.213
Wendell?

603
01:09:05.358 --> 01:09:08.132
Wendell,
is that you?

604
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.307
Hey, Mrs Avery.

605
01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:11.439
Well, is the elevator stuck?

606
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:13.180
Looks that way, huh?

607
01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:16.357
Um... I wouldn't worry
about it, though.

608
01:09:16.369 --> 01:09:19.578
Well, I never heard it make
that sound before.

609
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.624
Maybe I'd better
call the police. No!

610
01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:25.975
Uh, listen, I'm sure she'll come
back to life any second now.

611
01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:27.368
I'm fine.

612
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.544
All the same,
I'm calling the police

613
01:09:29.556 --> 01:09:31.416
just in case.

614
01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.635
No, Mrs Avery. No,
you don't need to do that.

615
01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:38.597
Mrs Avery!

616
01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:41.817
Aah!

617
01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:26.949
Aah!

618
01:10:48.853 --> 01:10:52.932
I wish I'd never...

619
01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:54.760
Aah!

620
01:11:22.539 --> 01:11:24.137
Carol?

621
01:11:34.507 --> 01:11:36.932
Carol?

622
01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:22.014
In sickness and in health,
TILL DEATH DO US PART.WOMAN: Sir?

623
01:14:23.328 --> 01:14:27.799
Sir? In sickness and in health,
till death do us part.

624
01:14:27.811 --> 01:14:35.811
In sickness and in health,
till death do us part.

625
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.509
I kind of hated that story.

626
01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:45.164
Oh.

627
01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:47.471
I mean, he did what anyone would
do in his situation,

628
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:50.212
yet he was punished for it.

629
01:14:50.224 --> 01:14:53.433
We must each fulfill
our destiny, young lady.

630
01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:55.566
Who are we to question fate?

631
01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:57.785
Yeah, and what was
Wendell's fate?

632
01:14:57.797 --> 01:15:00.745
He went mad.

633
01:15:00.757 --> 01:15:03.617
He was committed
to the local asylum.

634
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:07.839
Kirksdale?
Do you know it?

635
01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:10.189
Everyone knows Kirksdale.

636
01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:13.845
A vile and tragic place.

637
01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:20.416
What wood is this?

638
01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:26.248
Oh, you'd be surprised
what we find in people's colons.

639
01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.728
Oh.

640
01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.122
Ready for the best part?

641
01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:32.092
Yeah.

642
01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:38.739
When the house was built
at the turn of the century,

643
01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.915
there was no electricity.

644
01:15:40.927 --> 01:15:45.746
We had to think of creative ways
to keep the bodies cold.

645
01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:48.488
Hence,
the sub basement.

646
01:15:58.466 --> 01:16:00.761
Give me a hand,
will you?

647
01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:05.157
Gently.

648
01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:06.854
Don't take this the wrong way,

649
01:16:06.866 --> 01:16:12.164
but all of your stories...
are a little predictable.

650
01:16:12.176 --> 01:16:14.122
Predictable?

651
01:16:14.134 --> 01:16:17.169
Someone commits a sin,
they pay a horrible price.

652
01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:19.475
Rinse, repeat.

653
01:16:22.186 --> 01:16:26.961
The form may be familiar,
but the message is timeless.

654
01:16:26.973 --> 01:16:31.357
No evil deed goes unpunished.

655
01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:34.360
You don't really
believe that, do you?

656
01:16:34.372 --> 01:16:37.102
Completely.

657
01:16:42.815 --> 01:16:45.806
You're going to love
this next part.

658
01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.217
This is the heart of the house.

659
01:17:11.844 --> 01:17:15.053
This poor soul's journey
has come to an end.

660
01:17:15.065 --> 01:17:19.144
In dust we started,
to dust we return.

661
01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:21.146
Wait!

662
01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:31.025
I lied.

663
01:17:31.037 --> 01:17:34.202
I'm not here for the job.

664
01:17:34.214 --> 01:17:36.422
I'm here for him.

665
01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:40.644
You said no evil deed
goes unpunished...

666
01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:44.560
but you're wrong.

667
01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:49.653
In real life,
bad guys win all the time.

668
01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.742
Logan is proof.

669
01:17:56.846 --> 01:17:59.663
It's all my fault.

670
01:18:05.332 --> 01:18:08.454
Please, can I see him
one last time?

671
01:18:24.177 --> 01:18:26.385
I want to tell you his story.

672
01:18:35.798 --> 01:18:38.049
And with the handsome
knight by her side,

673
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:40.442
the princess knew that she would
be safe...

674
01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:43.315
...forever and ever.

675
01:18:43.327 --> 01:18:46.971
I wish I had a knight
like that to keep me safe.

676
01:18:46.983 --> 01:18:50.061
You don't need a handsome
knight, you got me, you twerp.

677
01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:54.587
Now go to sleep or your parents
are going to kill me.

678
01:18:54.599 --> 01:18:57.372
Aw.

679
01:18:57.384 --> 01:18:59.418
Denver residence.

680
01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:02.160
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, Bart.

681
01:19:02.172 --> 01:19:04.031
Want me to grab
some drinks on my way over?

682
01:19:04.043 --> 01:19:07.600
What part of "no guests allowed"
are you still grappling with?

683
01:19:07.612 --> 01:19:08.993
So, now I'm a guest, huh?

684
01:19:09.005 --> 01:19:10.951
Well,
no pervs allowed, either.

685
01:19:10.963 --> 01:19:12.866
I'm not a perv.

686
01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:14.781
I'm just worried
about you, is all...

687
01:19:14.793 --> 01:19:17.044
Home alone with that psycho
on the loose.

688
01:19:17.056 --> 01:19:18.916
Plus, I haven't seen
you in a week.

689
01:19:18.928 --> 01:19:20.787
I'm dying over here.

690
01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:24.225
Well, put an ice pack on it
because you're not coming over.

691
01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:26.271
Okay, I get it.

692
01:19:26.283 --> 01:19:28.012
Have fun babysitting.

693
01:20:14.635 --> 01:20:16.103
Aah!

694
01:20:16.115 --> 01:20:17.626
Mind if I join you?

695
01:20:17.638 --> 01:20:18.932
Bart, you creep!

696
01:20:18.944 --> 01:20:20.716
Well, I didn't see
that one coming.

697
01:20:35.482 --> 01:20:38.212
<i>Hi, Sam.</i>

698
01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:39.692
<i>It looks like we're going to be</i>

699
01:20:39.704 --> 01:20:41.302
<i>a little later than we expected.</i>

700
01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:42.651
<i>Might be a good idea
to check in on Logan</i>

701
01:20:42.663 --> 01:20:44.131
<i>every one in a while</i>

702
01:20:44.143 --> 01:20:45.524
<i>to make sure
he's actually sleeping</i>

703
01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:47.265
<i>and not playing
in his closet again.</i>

704
01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:48.919
<i>Or the hamper.
This is Dr. Kubler.</i>

705
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.703
<i>Honey.
Honey, shh, shh.</i>

706
01:20:50.715 --> 01:20:52.879
<i>If you get hungry, help
yourself to anything you like.</i>

707
01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:54.533
<i>Call me if you have
any questions.</i>

708
01:20:54.545 --> 01:20:57.362
<i>Bye.</i>

709
01:21:34.802 --> 01:21:36.183
<i>Power outages have been
reported throughout</i>

710
01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:37.402
<i>the Boggy Bay area.</i>

711
01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.708
<i>What did you want to show me?</i>

712
01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.277
<i>Oh, you know. Just the seven

Mount Rushmore's one of the s...</i>

715
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.805

the building's security system,</i>

723
01:22:55.318 --> 01:22:56.829

724
01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:58.483
<i>Uh, we can't confirm

725
01:22:58.495 --> 01:23:00.441

736
01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:30.732
<i>Smaller than I imagined. Hey, what?</i>

737
01:24:21.882 --> 01:24:25.831
<i>Got a killer on our hands,

<i>All the victims have been young,</i>

745
01:24:54.959 --> 01:25:00.431
<i>And what he wants, mind you...
is blood.</i>

746
01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.335
Aah!

747
01:25:44.617 --> 01:25:47.086
Can you help me?

748
01:25:56.803 --> 01:26:01.883
Do you know where you are?

749
01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:05.496
This isn't my house.

750
01:26:05.508 --> 01:26:09.239
I'm going to be in trouble.

751
01:26:09.251 --> 01:26:11.241
You're bleeding really badly.

752
01:26:11.253 --> 01:26:13.286
I know.

753
01:26:13.298 --> 01:26:15.897
Let me help you.
No.

754
01:26:38.671 --> 01:26:40.792
Don't.
Wait. Wait.

755
01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:43.186
Wait.

756
01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:44.839
Wait!

757
01:26:48.986 --> 01:26:51.977
What are you doing?

758
01:26:51.989 --> 01:26:56.373
I'm... I'm trying
to help you.

759
01:26:59.779 --> 01:27:04.424
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

760
01:27:06.308 --> 01:27:08.776
<i>Why the hell aren't you
answering the phone?!</i>

761
01:27:08.788 --> 01:27:10.909
<i>Listen there was a riot
over at the asylum,</i>

762
01:27:10.921 --> 01:27:14.129
<i>and a psychopath escaped.
It's the same one responsible</i>

763
01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:17.394
<i>for all those kids
that were mutilated and...</i>

764
01:27:17.406 --> 01:27:20.310
<i>Ugh. Lock the doors
and stay with Logan</i>

765
01:27:20.322 --> 01:27:21.833
<i>until we get home.</i>

766
01:28:47.017 --> 01:28:50.748
Oh, my God!

767
01:28:58.071 --> 01:29:00.932
Sam?!
Hello?! Sam?!

768
01:29:43.682 --> 01:29:45.498
Aah!

769
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.665
Aah!

770
01:31:15.687 --> 01:31:18.199
Where's the boy?!

771
01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:17.580
- Logan?!
- Sam?!

772
01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:19.625
Where... is he?!

773
01:33:19.637 --> 01:33:22.280
Where's the boy?!

774
01:33:30.561 --> 01:33:33.334
Wait.

775
01:33:33.346 --> 01:33:35.728
You're not a killer.

776
01:33:46.011 --> 01:33:49.873
You're right.

777
01:33:49.885 --> 01:33:52.136
I'm not!

778
01:34:17.521 --> 01:34:19.859
This is over.

779
01:34:23.483 --> 01:34:25.865
You're right.

780
01:34:25.877 --> 01:34:27.867
Aah!

781
01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.311
- What was that?
- I'm going around the back.

782
01:34:37.323 --> 01:34:39.009
Harold, wait.

783
01:34:55.994 --> 01:34:57.462
<i>Aah!</i>

784
01:35:00.782 --> 01:35:02.902
Is it over?

785
01:35:02.914 --> 01:35:05.165
It's over.

786
01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:10.083
It's over.

787
01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:26.012
This is for ruining my dinner.

788
01:35:26.024 --> 01:35:28.014
Aah!

789
01:35:35.207 --> 01:35:39.025
The window's broken.
Stay behind me.

790
01:35:46.828 --> 01:35:51.385
Oh, my God!

791
01:35:51.397 --> 01:35:54.214
Who is that?

792
01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:03.049
Sam?
It's the babysitter.

793
01:36:03.061 --> 01:36:07.227
Logan!

794
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.798
<i>We interrupt your program</i>

795
01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:16.019
<i>for another Action 4 News
special report.</i>

796
01:36:16.031 --> 01:36:18.282
<i>Police have confirmed
that the missing patient</i>

797
01:36:18.294 --> 01:36:20.458

798
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:22.416
<i>Known locally as the
Boggy Bay Tooth Fairy,</i>

799
01:36:22.428 --> 01:36:25.550
<i>Gibbons was convicted on 12
counts of murder and 10...</i>

800
01:36:37.966 --> 01:36:40.043
Debra?!

801
01:36:44.015 --> 01:36:45.483
I can't find Logan anywhere!

802
01:36:45.495 --> 01:36:47.267
I've done his room!

803
01:37:11.216 --> 01:37:14.599
Ohh, I see what you did there.

804
01:37:14.611 --> 01:37:18.733
Burying the lead
to throw me off... very clever.

805
01:37:18.745 --> 01:37:21.171
But I'm still confused.

806
01:37:21.183 --> 01:37:23.564
Why come back?

807
01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:25.740
You have your collection...

808
01:37:35.632 --> 01:37:37.622
...and I have mine.

809
01:37:48.079 --> 01:37:51.114
You're not going to tell anyone
my story, are you?

810
01:37:51.126 --> 01:37:54.595
Oh, of course not,
my dear.

811
01:37:57.219 --> 01:37:59.774
I'm sorry.

812
01:37:59.786 --> 01:38:03.256
In real life,
the bad guy wins.

813
01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.887
Oh, bravo!

814
01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:26.801
Bravo, my dear.

815
01:38:26.813 --> 01:38:30.762
But you committed
one fatal storytelling sin.

816
01:38:30.774 --> 01:38:34.244
You have underestimated
your audience.

817
01:38:39.478 --> 01:38:42.295
The job is yours.

818
01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:28.298
There's no use running.

819
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:42.660
You're only making this harder
on yourself.

820
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.181
Getting to know the place?

821
01:40:25.193 --> 01:40:28.097
What is this?

822
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:31.752
I believe it's a library.

823
01:40:31.764 --> 01:40:33.798
You know what I mean.

824
01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:38.803
You know,
I was once just like you,

825
01:40:38.815 --> 01:40:42.937
a traveler from the outer
regions of experience

826
01:40:42.949 --> 01:40:46.985
unbounded by the laws of nature,
or so I thought.

827
01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:55.907
Then I found my way
to his house,

828
01:40:55.919 --> 01:40:59.084
this... assignment.

829
01:40:59.096 --> 01:41:02.131
And everything changed.

830
01:41:05.146 --> 01:41:09.616
Throughout history, it has been
the role of the storyteller

831
01:41:09.628 --> 01:41:15.535
to remind us that each and every
action creates a ripple,

832
01:41:15.547 --> 01:41:19.235
each and every story
has repercussions.

833
01:41:22.032 --> 01:41:26.198
And you would be surprised
how many stories

834
01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:30.985
in this library...
are yours.

835
01:42:23.485 --> 01:42:28.434
I told you...
No-one escapes fate.

836
01:42:28.446 --> 01:42:30.480
I don't care
what you say, old man.

837
01:42:30.492 --> 01:42:32.221
I'm the master of my own fate.

838
01:42:32.233 --> 01:42:34.048
I say how my story ends.

839
01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:36.399
Ends?!

840
01:42:36.411 --> 01:42:39.053
Oh, my dear girl.

841
01:42:39.065 --> 01:42:42.927
Your story is just beginning!

842
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:44.860
Aaaah!

843
01:46:09.841 --> 01:46:15.748
Aaaaaah!

844
01:46:37.347 --> 01:46:39.685
I'd better get going.

845
01:46:39.697 --> 01:46:41.948
So soon?

846
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:47.171
I was just about to make dinner.
