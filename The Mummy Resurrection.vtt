[rubble clatters]

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.280
[eerie music]

5
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.600
Azaan,

6
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.600
hold the lantern up higher.

7
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.840
[eerie music]

8
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.360
There it is.

9
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.200
The sarcophagus.

10
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.560
I've finally gone one
better than Ivan Makepeace.

11
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.880
[Azaan] Who is this Makepeace?

12
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Oh, he's a rival of mine.

13
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.080
He's good.

14
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
[eerie music]

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.600
Very good.

16
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.280
[eerie music]

17
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.760
That sarcophagus contains

18
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.640
the mummified remains
of Khenmetptah.

19
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.480
A Second Dynasty princess.

20
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.600
Over 4,000 years old.

21
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.440
[eerie music]

22
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.960
Then let us hurry.

23
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.960
There's nothing to fear here.

24
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.880
No, wait, I want to translate
these hieroglyphs first.

25
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.360
[eerie music]

26
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.200
Now, that's 10.

27
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.800
10 hundred.

28
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.120
1,000. That's it now.

29
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.040
What's this figure here doing?

30
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.920
He's touching it.

31
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.720
It's so beautiful.

32
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.800
Don't rush, Azaan.

33
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.680
We are so close.

34
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.320
[eerie music]

35
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.120
These old tombs
are often built with

36
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.600
[Azaan gasps]

37
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.360
death traps.

38
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.400
[eerie music]

39
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.240
Ivan Makepeace.

40
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440
Are you sure?

41
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.240
Oh, yes.

42
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.320
I'd recognize that
face anywhere.

43
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.600
I told you not to hurry, Azaan.

44
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.120
Now just a moment.

45
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.280
I think I've got this.

46
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.120
[eerie music]

47
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.280
That symbol is death.

48
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.840
Death by a thousand
terrors awaits

49
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.480
anyone who touches
the sarcophagus.

50
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.240
Azaan, wait.

51
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.080
[dramatic music]

52
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.360
It's too late.

53
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.080
[dramatic music]

54
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.080
[dramatic music]

55
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.160
[dramatic music]

56
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.000
[dramatic music]

57
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.080
[man grunting]

58
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840
Mr. Rudolph.

59
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760
Mr. Sykes.

60
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.600
I don't suppose you could put

61
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.440
that bag back on
my head, could you?

62
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.840
The view was a lot
better in there, you see.

63
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.040
Very funny, Everett.

64
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.680
I always admire a man who can
laugh in the face of danger.

65
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.280
Mr. Sykes, what's
all this about?

66
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.000
You know exactly
what this is about.

67
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.080
The 10 pounds you
borrowed off me last month

68
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.320
for what you termed as
a solid gold investment

69
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.720
from which I've yet
to see any return.

70
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.720
Oh, that.

71
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.960
Yeah. That.

72
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.120
So what was it all about?

73
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.040
You see, I had a tip

74
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.560
that someone needed to offload
some jewelry in a hurry.

75
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
Stolen, was it?

76
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.520
Nah, nothing like that.

77
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.320
This old girl,

78
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.600
she'd recently lost her husband.

79
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.560
And well, she wanted a few
extra pennies for the funeral.

80
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.200
Anyway, it turned out
pickings were a bit richer

81
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320
than I thought.

82
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.480
10 pounds just wasn't enough.

83
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.800
So I...

84
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.480
Yeah?

85
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.600
Went down the horse track.

86
00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720
And?

87
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.000
[eerie music]

88
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.480
Lost the lot.

89
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.280
Oh, well.

90
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.080
Now, let's see.

91
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.680
That's 10 pounds.

92
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.320
The daily rate of 100%
compound interest over 30 days.

93
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.240
Let's just say you
owe me a lot of money.

94
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.080
Do you have a lot of
money on you at present?

95
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.000
Not on me at present.

96
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.560
No, I didn't think so.

97
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.080
Got something to
show you, Everett.

98
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.920
[fire crackling]

99
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.200
This is Alice. [dramatic music]

100
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.200
Now, she borrowed money
off me, just like you did.

101
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.720
Half a crown.

102
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.120
Only she did it to feed
her little children,

103
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.280
rather than waste it
down at the horse track.

104
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.920
And just like you,

105
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.320
she always had a excuse
for not paying her debt.

106
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.480
Well, I guess those children
are going hungry now.

107
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480
You killed her
over half a crown?

108
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.680
We did more than that, Everett.

109
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.120
The lads here had their
way with her beforehand.

110
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.320
And then again, afterwards.

111
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.480
You see, this is a lesson

112
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.160
in what happens to
people who owe me money

113
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.520
and then fail to pay up.

114
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.240
But we're not at
that stage just yet.

115
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.000
Little pain will help
the message sink in.

116
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.200
Nobby, get the clamp.

117
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.720
No, you don't have to do that.

118
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.480
You don't need the clamp.

119
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.080
Don't, don't. No!

120
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.400
[metal creaking]

121
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.240
No! Check my pocket.

122
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.320
I'm about to come
into a fortune.

123
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.120
Pull the other one, Everett.

124
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240
Give it another turn.

125
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.400
There's a telegram in my pocket.

126
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.960
[metal creaks]

127
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.400
Which pocket?

128
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.000
Inside pocket, the jacket.

129
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.440
Left side.

130
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.200
Ah!

131
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.960
[fire crackling]

132
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.360
Dr. Felix Randolph requests
your presence at eight o'clock

133
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.280
on Thursday the 12th
to discuss the matter

134
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.120
of your inheritance.

135
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.280
Yeah. I told you.

136
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.920
What's this all about?

137
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.960
It's my Uncle Felix Randolph.

138
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.200
You might have heard of him.

139
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.760
Isn't he some sort
of treasure hunter?

140
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.640
So they say.

141
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.680
This is all very
interesting, Everett.

142
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.440
Thought you might
say that, Mr. Sykes.

143
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.280
This telegram says eight o'clock

144
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.520
and you are still sat here.

145
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.840
Shouldn't you be
seeing your uncle?

146
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.360
Well, it may have escaped
your attention, Sykes,

147
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.720
but I'm currently somewhat
being forcibly detained.

148
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.240
All right.

149
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.280
Let him go, Charlie.

150
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.680
[metal creaks]

151
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.240
Much obliged.

152
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.560
Well, I'll let you
know how it goes, then.

153
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.040
Hold on.

154
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.880
[fire crackling]

155
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.720
You'll do more than
that, Mr. Randolph.

156
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.800
[eerie music] [fire crackling]

157
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.560
I wanna know exactly what
you stand to inherit.

158
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.640
And when you expect
to receive it.

159
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.080
Because whatever
it is, it's mine.

160
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.440
[dramatic music]

161
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.000
Everett.

162
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.880
He's coming here?

163
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.840
Well, he should be.

164
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.520
I sent him a telegram two days
ago requesting his presence

165
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.720
by eight o'clock.

166
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.320
But you can never be too
sure with Everett, can you?

167
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.280
Well, it's nearly eight now.

168
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.040
You were going to tell
me what happened to Azaan

169
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.480
in the pyramid.

170
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.840
Ever the curious one, Archie.

171
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.560
I'm pleased to see that some
of my spirit of adventure

172
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.040
has rubbed off on you.
[gentle music]

173
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.120
You certainly didn't
get it from your father.

174
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.880
And the less said about my
other brother, the better.

175
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.840
And his wife.

176
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.680
But look at me now.

177
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.400
I've outlived the lot of them.

178
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.160
[knuckles tapping]
[gentle music]

179
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.560
That'll be Everett.

180
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.240
It's all right.

181
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.960
Nancy will see to him.

182
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.520
[gentle music]

183
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.640
[knuckles tapping]

184
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.200
[Archie] You were
going to tell me

185
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.440
what happened in the pyramid.

186
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.840
Nothing happened in the pyramid.

187
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.920
It was hours later that
the curse came into effect.

188
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.400
You really believe in
ancient Egyptian curses?

189
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.280
I believe in what I saw.

190
00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.200
The curse promised death
by a thousand terrors.

191
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.200
[gentle music]

192
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.920
And by next morning,
Azaan was dead.

193
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.800
And the look on his face...

194
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.720
Uncle Felix.

195
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.120
So good to see you.

196
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.600
I mean, it's been too long.

197
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.120
Well, you're always
so busy, Everett.

198
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.960
This is true,
uncle. This is true.

199
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.160
Lots of irons in the
fire, as they say.

200
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.760
Oh and you, good old-

201
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.720
- Archie.

202
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.320
Archie.

203
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.720
Good old cousin Archie.

204
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.040
You must be a doctor now.

205
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.720
Ah, not quite.

206
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.240
Still studying.

207
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.640
Uncle Felix is letting
me use his workshop

208
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.840
while I do my research projects.

209
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.360
Sounds fascinating.

210
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.680
Could you get these gentlemen
a drink please, Nancy?

211
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.320
And one for yourself, uncle?

212
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.840
No, no, no.

213
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.880
That's part of the
issue, I'm afraid.

214
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.800
[melancholy music]

215
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.680
As you know, gentlemen, I've
always lived an active life.

216
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.080
Be it carving ice
caves in Mongolia

217
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.320
or wading through
marshes and darkest Peru.

218
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.240
Nothing has ever held me back.

219
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.400
Not even the disapproval of
most of the Randolph family.

220
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.040
But these last few months,

221
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.360
I've been finding things
haven't been as easy

222
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.600
as they used to be.

223
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.040
I get breathless just
walking up the stairs

224
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160
here in this house.

225
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.960
So last week, I
asked a medical man

226
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.560
to come and give
me the once over.

227
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.680
You could have asked me, uncle.

228
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.040
I know, Archie.

229
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.680
But a man likes to keep
some things to himself

230
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.240
until the time is right.
[melancholy music]

231
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.200
And he has put his
affairs in order.

232
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.400
The fact is, gentlemen,

233
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.880
that my old ticker
is on the way out.

234
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.080
[melancholy music]

235
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.920
He tells me that as long
as I keep to my bed,

236
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.920
avoid over exertion,
strong drink, rich foods,

237
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.840
then it should last
until Christmas.

238
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.120
But not beyond.
[melancholy music]

239
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.080
And this is where the matter

240
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200
of your inheritance
comes into play.

241
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.320
I've spent my life
traveling the world,

242
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.360
collecting rare artifacts
and valuable antiquities.

243
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.040
My collection to date includes
all the major civilizations.

244
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.520
Solid gold coins
from ancient Rome,

245
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.640
beautiful vases from
Ming dynasty China,

246
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.520
and an original da Vinci print

247
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.880
that I found in a
junk shop in Venice.

248
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.960
And all of these things,
with one exception,

249
00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.600
I have bequeathed to
the British Museum.

250
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.760
[melancholy music]

251
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.320
So, what, you're just
gonna give it all away?

252
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.400
Artifacts such as these
should be seen by everyone,

253
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.480
not to be hoarded
away by an old man

254
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.920
in search of profit.

255
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.400
I think it's an
excellent gesture.

256
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.440
Is that what all the
commotion was yesterday?

257
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.920
Yes. Yes.

258
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.400
It took six carriages
to get everything away.

259
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.040
But you said with one exception.

260
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.040
- Yes.
[melancholy music]

261
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.080
There is one item so dangerous

262
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.120
it must never see
the light of day.

263
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.720
The sarcophagus of Khenmetptah.

264
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.320
It's here, in the house?

265
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.600
Downstairs in the basement,

266
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.800
where it will stay.

267
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.200
I intend to have
it interred there,

268
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.120
bricked up so it can
never be seen again.

269
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.200
Sorry.

270
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.880
What is a sarcophagus?

271
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.640
[eerie music]

272
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.320
It's an ancient Egyptian
burial receptacle.

273
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.240
And what does it look like?

274
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.600
It's a life-size
solid gold humanoid

275
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.040
covered in precious jewels.

276
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.120
Can I see it?

277
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.920
I don't think that's
such a good idea, Everett.

278
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.320
It sounds so beautiful, uncle.

279
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.280
Indeed.

280
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.520
It is.

281
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.080
Well, if it's just
gonna get bricked up,

282
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.680
I probably won't get
another chance, will I?

283
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.320
Oh, come on, uncle, please.

284
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.320
Yes, of course.

285
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.160
Nancy will show you the way.

286
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.080
[eerie music]

287
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.480
Just one thing.

288
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.480
Whatever you do, do
not lay a finger on it.

289
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.360
[eerie music]

290
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.320
You hear that, did you?

291
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.360
He's giving it all away.

292
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.440
He's mad. He's mad.

293
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.960
Was that wise, uncle?

294
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.200
How much trouble
can he get up to?

295
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.040
Besides, I wanted to
talk to you alone.

296
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.040
I've seen the way that you
and Nancy look at each other.

297
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.440
Oh.

298
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.000
No need to be ashamed.

299
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.600
A young man must be allowed
to sow his wild oats.

300
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.800
Just don't get her into trouble,

301
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.960
whatever you do.

302
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.040
Well, it's a bit
more serious than that.

303
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.040
Oh, you haven't already
got her into trouble.

304
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.920
No, no.

305
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.920
I mean, my feelings for her.

306
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.080
[melancholy music]
[rain pattering]

307
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.040
Your mother wouldn't
have approved.

308
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.920
You're a Randolph, Archie,
carrying on with the maid.

309
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.960
Well, she's awfully intelligent.

310
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.680
She's been helping
me with my research.

311
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.920
Just because she's
a maid does not-

312
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.280
- I said your mother
wouldn't have approved,

313
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400
not that I didn't.

314
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.680
And it won't affect my decision.

315
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.800
- What decision?
[melancholy music]

316
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.960
I haven't got a lot, Archie.

317
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.640
The treasures that I spent my
life pursuing are all gone.

318
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.840
And the family fortune,
such as it was,

319
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.000
gambled away by
Everett's father.

320
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.280
But I do have this house,

321
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.320
and for what it's worth,
it's yours, Archie.

322
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.240
[melancholy music]

323
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.120
[door rumbling]

324
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.160
Is this it?

325
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.200
Dr. Randolph told
me never to touch it.

326
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.080
[eerie music]

327
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.760
[wood creaking]

328
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.680
Well, I don't know what to say.

329
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.320
All I ask is that you
brick up the basement,

330
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.200
as I've said.

331
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.560
Well, of course.

332
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.800
Beyond that, you can
stay exactly as you are.

333
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.560
I wouldn't want your
research to be interrupted

334
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.520
by you having to up sticks
and move somewhere else

335
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.920
when I kick the bucket.

336
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.520
Actually, uncle, there's
something I wanted to tell you.

337
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.640
[eerie music]

338
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.360
[wood rattling]

339
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.840
[eerie music]

340
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.200
[Everett] Look at that.

341
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.640
The problem is with your heart?

342
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.920
So I'm told.

343
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.600
It appears that I have been
overworking it all these years.

344
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.320
I suppose, in the end, one
always has to pay the piper.

345
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.000
There are things that
can be done, uncle.

346
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120
I've read up on it.

347
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.240
Even in my own research.

348
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.880
Currently it's on rats,

349
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.200
but I have successfully
restarted the heart of an animal.

350
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.800
And there was a
case in Luxembourg-

351
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.520
- Stop, Archie.

352
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.360
I know you mean well, but
I've accepted my condition.

353
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.680
But your doctor said
there was a chance.

354
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.280
So long as I stay in
bed, avoid over exertion,

355
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.240
strong drink, rich food,
et cetera, et cetera.

356
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.360
Archie, does that sound
like any kind of life?

357
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.080
I have something
else for you here.

358
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.080
What's that for?

359
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.480
[eerie music]

360
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.920
Oh.

361
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.960
The pistol.

362
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.360
Force of habit, I'm afraid

363
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.800
When you sleep
anywhere in the Orient,

364
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.480
it's a good idea to
be close to a weapon.

365
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.800
No, this is what I
want you to have.

366
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.920
It's my journal of
my time in Egypt.

367
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.320
Perhaps you can make
something of it.

368
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.080
Solve the mystery of
the cursed sarcophagus.

369
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.400
[eerie music] [rain pattering]

370
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.280
I never could.

371
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.680
It's even more beautiful
than I ever imagined.

372
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.880
It's gold.

373
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.760
It's real gold.

374
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.680
Well, this must be
worth a fortune.

375
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.760
[eerie music]

376
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.920
And he wants to brick
it up down here?

377
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.880
I'll have to see about that.

378
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.560
[eerie music]

379
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.360
Well, uncle, it's been
an absolute pleasure,

380
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.920
but must get back
into town, you know?

381
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.200
Places to be, people
to see and all that.

382
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.720
Archie, could you
show Everett out please?

383
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.080
I'm a little tired, I think.

384
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.880
Yes, of course.

385
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.480
[rain pattering]

386
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.680
Well, it's an
impressive building,

387
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.000
I'll give you that, Archie.

388
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.880
Not sure about these
floor tiles though.

389
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.360
Oh, and this wall here
is gonna have to go.

390
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.600
I mean, these old buildings

391
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.240
are full of these little
rooms, aren't they?

392
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.560
Not really great for
dinner parties, Archie.

393
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.440
Actually, Everett,

394
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.360
Uncle Felix said he's
leaving the house to me.

395
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.480
[thunder rumbles]

396
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.560
He said what?

397
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.240
Well, I'm here for the
summer for my research project.

398
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.800
And he didn't want
to turf me out,

399
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.600
if the worst were to happen.

400
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.680
And what about that
thingumajig in the basement?

401
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.600
The sarcophagus?

402
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.800
Well, I suppose
that'll be mine too,

403
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.240
if it's to stay in the basement.

404
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.400
That's nice, isn't it?

405
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.840
I mean, he writes me to tell
me about this inheritance

406
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.400
and then sends me away packing
with nothing in my pocket.

407
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.040
Typical. Typical of this family.

408
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.560
Always treated me like
a second class relative.

409
00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.880
Well, I'm sorry, Everett.

410
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.680
I don't quite know what to say.

411
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.760
That's all right, Archie.

412
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.280
You've always been a good lad.

413
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.600
Now tell me more about
this research stuff.

414
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.120
Well, it's rather
hard to explain

415
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.480
without going into detail.

416
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.400
I could show you, if you like.

417
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.480
[eerie music] [thunder rumbling]

418
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.680
Medical school is
closed for the summer,

419
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.960
so this is where I've been
conducting my research.

420
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.840
Not bad, Archie.

421
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.840
[rat squeaking]

422
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.600
What've you got in there?

423
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.520
Rats.

424
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.800
Ah.

425
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.440
[rat squeaking]

426
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.960
Very nice.

427
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.400
Yeah. This should do me
for the night, I think.

428
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.880
Sorry, what?

429
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.200
You don't mind, do you,

430
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.440
if I bunk down here with you?

431
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.080
It's just that
there's only one bed.

432
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.240
That's all right.

433
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.040
You'll be all right on
the floor, won't you?

434
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.920
It's just I thought you
needed to get back into town.

435
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.000
No rush.

436
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.120
Thought I might stick
around for a bit.

437
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.800
You know, keep an eye on things.

438
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.040
Watch out for you, Archie.

439
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.920
Me?

440
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.000
Yeah, well, [thunder rumbles]

441
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.960
family is family.

442
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.280
And what with you being the
sole heir and everything.

443
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.400
I mean, it'd be tragic if
anything happened to you.

444
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.320
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

445
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.520
That sarcophi...

446
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.520
Sarcophagus.

447
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.240
Yeah.

448
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.200
Did Uncle Felix say they
actually buried people inside them?

449
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.920
Yes. Well, only
important people.

450
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.600
Kings and such like.

451
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.640
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

452
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.640
They would mummify the
remains to preserve them,

453
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.360
stick them inside a sarcophagus,

454
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.160
and bury them.

455
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.560
That one, I believe,
belongs to a princess.

456
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.760
Princess?

457
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.440
Well, what's left of one.

458
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.560
It's not my area of expertise.

459
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.400
There's more
information in here.

460
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.040
And what's that?

461
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.520
Uncle Felix's journal.

462
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.680
According to the available
translated writing,

463
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.120
Princess Khenmetptah was
mummified using a unique process

464
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.880
to perfectly preserve
the body as if in life.

465
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.840
Unusually, the princess
was interred fully intact.

466
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.800
Whereas, in most cases of
Egyptian mummification,

467
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.000
a cut is made on the
left side of the abdomen

468
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.360
and the intestines, liver,
stomach, and lungs are removed

469
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.240
and a hooked instrument was used

470
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.880
to remove the brain
through the nose.

471
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.880
Bloody hell.

472
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.360
Leave it out, Archie.

473
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.120
[suspenseful music]

474
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.920
Apologies.

475
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.200
I forget people are
squeamish about these things.

476
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.680
Yeah, well you'd be
bloody squeamish too

477
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.240
if you'd seen the
stuff I'd seen today.

478
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.080
What's that?

479
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.520
Don't worry about it.

480
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.720
I'm gonna get some shut eye.

481
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.600
Probably have bloody
nightmares now.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.400

[woman murmuring] [eerie music]

490
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.080
No! No, no, please, no!

491
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.240
Please! Please!

[eerie music]
[creature growling]

493
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.680
Khenmetptah!

for me at last!

[men panting] [rain pattering]

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.600
- It wanted to take my heart.
It wanted to take my heart.

501
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.640
What did?

502
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.400
[woman screams]

503
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.240

[eerie music]

506
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.840
He's dead.

507
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.360
Dear God, look at
his expression.

508
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.320
[eerie music]

509
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.920
It's almost as if...

510
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.680
He was scared to death.

511
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.400
Bloody hell.

512
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.200
What's happened?

513
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.920
- Did you touch it?
[suspenseful music]

514
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.080
What?

515
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.920
- The sarcophagus.
Did you touch it?

516
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.960
[suspenseful music]

517
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:01.720
I...

518
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.840
[suspenseful music]

519
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.960
I knew it.

520
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.880
He specifically told
you not to touch it!

521
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.120
I only wanted to have a look.

522
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.760
It's cursed, Everett.

523
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.120
Sorry, what?

524
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.320
Hold the lamp.

525
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.880
Wait, what are you doing?

526
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.320
Why do you think he
told you not to touch it?

527
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.320
Probably thought
I was gonna nick it.

528
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.960
Were you?

529
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.160
[suspenseful music]

530
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.680
What's all this about a curse?

531
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.080
Anyone who touches
the sarcophagus

532
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.320
is doomed to a death
by a thousand terrors.

533
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.440
[suspenseful music]

534
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.600
Something scared the hell out
of you just now, didn't it?

535
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.200
Just a dream, that's all.

536
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.080
Was it?

537
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.640
You were screaming and
thrashing on that bed.

538
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.160
I've never seen
anything like it.

539
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.080
If Uncle Felix suffered
the same experience as you,

540
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.000
no wonder his heart gave out.

541
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.000
That's nonsense.

542
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.960
I mean, yeah, I touched
the sarcophagus.

543
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.040
Uncle Felix didn't.

544
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.960
So how comes he's
dead and I'm not?

545
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.120
You might have been

546
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.840
if I hadn't have woken you.

547
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.720
Come on, Archie.

548
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.960
I mean, you're supposed
to be a scientist, right?

549
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.680
Surely you don't
believe in curses.

550
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.280
[suspenseful music]

551
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.840
[birds chirping]

552
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.120
Archie, are you all right?

553
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.320
Yes.

554
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.720
A little tired.

555
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.480
Did you manage to sleep much?

556
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.480
No.

557
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.480
Me neither.

558
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.680
Where's...

559
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.160
Everett?

560
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.640
He was out at the crack of dawn.

561
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.360
Said he had things to do.

562
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.640
I brought you some tea.

563
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040
Nancy.

564
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.480
[gentle music]

565
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.880
You don't have to
do that anymore.

566
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.240
You were employed by my
Uncle Felix, not by me.

567
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.080
You don't have to be a
maid for anyone anymore.

568
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.640
Well, that's all very
well and good, Archie,

569
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.080
but it also means
I'm out of a job now.

570
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.840
And you don't have one either.

571
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.200
So what will we do?

572
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.840
Well, don't worry.

573
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.440
As soon as I'm
qualified as a doctor,

574
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.600
we'll be able to open up a
practice far away from here

575
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.640
where I'll just be Dr. Randolph

576
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.400
and you'll just
be Mrs. Randolph.

577
00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.760
[uplifting music]

578
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.440
No one will know
your background so...

579
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.320
Why are you looking
at me like that?

580
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.720
Mrs. Randolph?

581
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.880
Are you asking me
to marry you Archie?

582
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.360
- Oh, well I suppose I am.
[uplifting music]

583
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.160
Well, is that a yes then?

584
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.840
Of course it is.

585
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.880
You know, deep down
I always wondered

586
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.600
if your feelings
for me were real.

587
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.000
Of course they are.

588
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.960
Real enough, I mean.

589
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.360
Compared to what you
might have to sacrifice.

590
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.920
What are you talking about?

591
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.640
You know what I'm talking about.

592
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.400
A Randolph shouldn't
marry someone like me

593
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.680
and you know it.

594
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.960
Well, I am a Randolph

595
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.200
and I get to say whether
I should marry you or not.

596
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.600
And I say that I should.

597
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.720
[Everett coughs]

598
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.720
[Everett] Oh, tea.

599
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.600
Very nice.

600
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.000
You were out early this morning.

601
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.240
Yeah.

602
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.680
I wanted to get to
the newspaper office.

603
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.600
See, I've got a pal in there

604
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.040
that can get a story out quick.

605
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.160
Look at that.

606
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.360
Obituaries.

607
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.440
Dr. Felix Randolph.

608
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.280
Oh, I've registered the
death over at the town hall

609
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.520
and I've arranged the
undertakers to collect the body.

610
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.520
You certainly don't
waste any time, do you?

611
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.800
I'm just thinking
of you, Archie.

612
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.600
Probate is a slow process

613
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.720
and I don't suppose
this research brings

614
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.480
in much money, does it?

615
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.320
Well, one day it will.

616
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.280
One day I'll be able to prevent

617
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.000
what happened to Uncle Felix.

618
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.680
You're working on a cure
for death now, are you?

619
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.200
Not exactly.

620
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.120
But restarting the heart
after a major trauma.

621
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.200
It can be done, Everett.

622
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.880
It's entirely possible.

623
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.680
There was a case in Luxembourg

624
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.160
where a patient had been
pronounced dead for 30 minutes

625
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.960
before being
successfully revived.

626
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.360
And I'm replicating
this process on my rats.

627
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.760
Do you know there's
a lot of people in town

628
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.240
that make a lot of money
out of killing rats.

629
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.920
And there you are, trying to
bring the buggers back to life.

630
00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.080
Well, all I'm trying to do now

631
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.640
is figure out this
curse business.

632
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.280
It's my understanding that
these ancient Egyptians

633
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.840
were rather advanced

634
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.360
with their pharmacological
and medical knowledge.

635
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.800
Fascinating, I'm sure.

636
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.160
[eerie music]

637
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.920
I've been meaning to ask you,

638
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.040
what exactly was it
that you experienced?

639
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.840
Nothing.

640
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.520
It was just a dream.
[eerie music]

641
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.400
Probably brought on by all
that talk of extracting organs.

642
00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.320
Yes.

643
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.640
Organs.

644
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.240
You said it wanted your heart.

645
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.440
What did?

646
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.960
[eerie music]

647
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.160
Well, it was like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

648
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.200
She had bandages,

649
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.640
head to toe in bandages.

650
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.840
A woman?

651
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.400
She was, once.

652
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.160
The Princess Khenmetptah.

653
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.000
Nonsense.

654
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.520
And even if it was
some sort of curse,

655
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.080
then how comes it only
affected Uncle Felix

656
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.440
and not the rest of you?

657
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.720
I don't know.

658
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.280
What was the name of
that princess again?

659
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.120
Khenmetptah.

660
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.560
How do you spell that?

661
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.320
K-H-E-N-M-E-T-P-T-A-H.

662
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.840
Lovely. Thank you very much.

663
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.760
Why did you want to know that?

664
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.800
Just interested.

665
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.960
[silly bright music]

666
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.800

[suspenseful music]

669
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.360
Knobby, get the clamp.

670
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.480
[suspenseful music]

671
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.960
What's this?

672
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.440
It's my hand, Sykes.

673
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.360
You know, for the clamp.

674
00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.760
We're a bit beyond
that stage, Mr. Randolph.

675
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.280
There's something
else you've got two of

676
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.280
that we're gonna be
putting in the clamp today.

677
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.360
Get his pants off, lads.

678
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.600
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

679
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.880
You were supposed
to come and see me

680
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.320
after your little meeting.

681
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.360
I was just on my way.

682
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.400
You were heading in
the wrong direction.

683
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.800
No, I was just-

684
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.960
- Get him on the table, lads.

685
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.240
I had to sort out
a few things, okay?

686
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.440
Take care of business.

687
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.560
Take care of what?

688
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.120
When are you getting
this inheritance?

689
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.280
Obituaries. The back page.

690
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.360
[suspenseful music]
[fire crackling]

691
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.640
Noted Explorer Felix Randolph.

692
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.960
He's dead?

693
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.760
Died last night.

694
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.480
Well, that was bloody quick.

695
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.040
Did you have something
to do with this?

696
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.240
He had a weak heart.

697
00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.560
Yeah.

698
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.800
I might have helped things
move along a bit. Yeah.

699
00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.000
Well, well.

700
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.200
I've got to say, I'm
impressed, Everett.

701
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.360
I never thought you had the
balls to do something like that.

702
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.400
Well, if it's all
the same to you, Sykes,

703
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.560
I'd very much like
to keep hold of them.

704
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.160
All right.

705
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.160
Let him go.

706
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.800
Much obliged.

707
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.960
So what can we expect to
receive from your late uncle?

708
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.120
Oh, it's beautiful, Sykes.

709
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.840
It really is.

710
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.240
I mean, it's gold, jewel
encrusted, 4,000 years old.

711
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.960
I mean, it's priceless.

712
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.920
Your share of it will certainly
clear my debt with you.

713
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.080
My share of it?

714
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.600
You do make me laugh, Everett.

715
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.480
I mean, whoever said
anything about shares?

716
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.200
You see, the plan is
I get the inheritance.

717
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.200
And you?

718
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.280
You get to avoid what happened
to Alice happening to you.

719
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.040
At least I'm not
a woman, Sykes, eh?

720
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.480
Well, these labs
aren't fussy, Everett.

721
00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.640
They've done long stretches
inside. You know how it is.

[suspenseful music]

723
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.560
If I don't see
some hard evidence

724
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.240
of all this money you're gonna
make by the end of tomorrow,

725
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.200
you'll be a dead man.

726
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.480
All right?

[Felix Voiceover] Having
exhausted the writings

730
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.280
on the wall of the tomb,

731
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.720
I began to research further
into the life and death

732
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.200
of the princess.

733
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.840
Why had such a prominent person
died at such a young age?

734
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.880
What I discovered
shocked me to my core.

[birds chirping]

736
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.040
What are you reading?

737
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.680
This is Uncle Felix's journal.

738
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.760
I'm trying to figure
out this curse business.

739
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.200
According to the journal,

740
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.560
it's only those who've had
direct physical contact

741
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.080
with the sarcophagus
who've fallen victim to it.

742
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.360
Well, Everett certainly did.

743
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.760
Rubbed his hand all over it

744
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.760
like he was in love with it.

745
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.560
In love with the gold and
the jewels, I should imagine.

[eerie music]

747
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.760
Which hand did he use?

748
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.040
His right, I think.

749
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.880

shake hands with Uncle Felix.

Did you manage to pick up

I'm sorry, Ivy.

758

Just couldn't get
the cash in time.

Well, it's not with me.

765
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.520
It's a bit big.

766
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.200
I need to cash it in quick.

769
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.680
Yeah, you could say that.

Well, we've got to open her up.

774
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.920
Have a closer look at it.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.000
Are you sure?

776
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.680
Don't worry.

777
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.120

I mean, it's beautiful.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.960
It's gold.

782
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080
It's as big as a person.

783
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.360
It's priceless.

Of course I have.

Randolph dug up, isn't it?

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.680

792

and he died last night,

793

Finally caught up
with him in the end.

797
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.240
What did?

798
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.360
The curse from that sarcophagus.

[clocks ticking] [eerie music]

800
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.800
I thought so.

801
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.160
There's a layer of oil
coating the sarcophagus.

802
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.480
I'll need to take a sample.

803
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.080
Be careful, Archie.

804
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200
Not to worry.

805
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.920
I'm wearing gloves.

806
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.960
So you've heard about
this curse then, have you?

807
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.240
Everybody knows about it.

808
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.680
Everybody in the trade, anyway.

809
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.080
Randolph had to charter his
own ship to bring it to London.

810
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.560
No bugger would touch it.

811
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.000
It's all nonsense, Ivy.

812
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.080
And I heard someone on the ship

813
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.920
thought he'd have a butchers.

814
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.680
And it sent him mad.

815
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.560
He threw himself overboard.

816
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.920
Ivy, it's not that bad.

817
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.440
I touched it.

818
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.680
I'm not dead.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.800
Get out.

821
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.400
And don't you dare bring
that sarcophagus in here.

822
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.920
I don't wanna be
anywhere near it.

823
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.200
Fine.

824
00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.000
I'll take it over to
Irish Bob's place then.

825
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.080
He'll tell you the
same thing I did.

826
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.360
Anyone in the trade will.

827
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.000
That thing's not priceless.

828
00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.440
It's worthless.

[eerie music] [clocks ticking]

830
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.440
You couldn't pay anyone
to take it off your hands.

831
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.200
Now go on.

832
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Get out.

What are you doing?

837
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.880
I have a theory

838
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.840
that this curse is
more pharmacological

839
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.000
than it is supernatural.

840
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.760
Everett used his right hand
to touch the sarcophagus,

841
00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.520
acquiring a thin coating of oil.

842
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.200
And then he shook
hands with Uncle Felix,

843
00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.440
passing it on to him.

844
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.000

to one of my rats.

[rats squeaking]

847
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.840
There are certain
chemicals known

848
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.560
to have a psychotropic effect

849
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.240
when they enter the bloodstream.

850
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.960
[Nancy] Which means?

851
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.800
It makes you see
things. Drives you insane.

852
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.280
Seems very possible to me

853
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.880
that these clever
Egyptians created

854
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.200
some form of powerful
psychotropic formula

855
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.880
and then mixed it with
something, like ground thorns.

856
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.840
Something sharp enough
to pierce the skin,

857
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.520
but small enough that
you'd never feel it.

858
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.320
And then they coated
the sarcophagus with it.

859
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.320
But-

860
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.240
- Wait, listen.

He's becoming agitated.

863
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.280
I think it's working.

867
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.520
Yes.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.880
Right now he's
experiencing pure terror

869
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.600
and then his body will
release adrenaline,

870
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.720
too much for the
heart to cope with.

871
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.640
It's only a matter
of time before

[suspenseful music]

875
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.480
Is that what happened
to Dr. Randolph?

876

I'm afraid so.

877
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.040
Now we've just got to...

878
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.240
What is it?

880
00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.920
Oh God.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.720
I am so stupid.
So bloody stupid.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.560
What is it, Archie?

883
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.360
The oil.

884
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.080
If it can penetrate the skin,
it can penetrate leather.

Spare any change, mister?

889
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.120
You what?

890
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.760
Spare any change?

891
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.600
Does it look like
I've got money to waste?

892
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.600
Looks like you got more than me.

Yeah, well, give it time.

I might be by tomorrow.

Come on, mister, just a penny.

897
00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.160
I'll work for it.

898
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.760
I'll do anything for a penny.

899
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.640
All right, I'll think about it.

900
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.200
I'm always here, mister.

901
00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.760
Day or night.

902
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.520
Just ask around for Shelly.

903
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.520
[suspenseful music]

904
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.000
- That's it, Nancy.
As tight as you can.

905
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.840
If I start thrashing around,
I'm liable to injure myself.

906
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.080
What else can I do?

907
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.400
Just watch over me.

908
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.200
[suspenseful music]

909
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.280
If I go into a trance,
you'll have to wake me.

910
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.280
How?

911
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.880
Do whatever it takes.

912
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.480
It won't be easy, but it's
the only way to save my life.

913
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.600
You'll need to wake me before
the adrenaline in my system

914
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.840
starts to overstimulate
my heart and...

915
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.040
Nancy?

916
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.280
Oh God.

917
00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.720
Okay.

918
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.840
Whatever you see,
Archie, it is not real.

919
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.920
[suspenseful music]

920
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.840
[creature growling]

921
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.960
[suspenseful music]

922
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.880
Oh Lord!

923
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.680
[suspenseful music]
[creature growling]

924
00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.680
No!

925
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.680
No, no, no, my heart! No!

926
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.640
No!

927
00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.200
No, not my heart.

928
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.200
[Archie panting]

929
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.880
Are you alright?

930
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.440
- I think so.
[uplifting music]

931
00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.840
My heart is pounding.

932
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.720
You make me feel the same way.

933
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.920
[uplifting music]

934
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.480
You did it, Nancy.

935
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.960
You saved my life.

936
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.920
[uplifting music]

937
00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.520
- I knew it.
[bright suspenseful music]

938
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.640
I knew there was something
going on between the two of you.

939
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.040
I didn't have you down
as the kinky sort though.

940
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.640
You oughta watch her, Archie.

941
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.080
She'll have you wearing
her dresses next.

942
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.440
I know the type.

943
00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.320
Shut up and come
and help untie me.

944
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.640
I've just been through

945
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.600
the same thing you
and Uncle Felix have.

946
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.400
[Everett] You've
been cursed or what?

947
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.080
It's not a curse.

948
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.040
[melancholy music]

949
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.640
It's a psychotropic chemical.

950
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.960
It gets under your skin

951
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.160
and it makes you see things.

952
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.720
Terrible things.

953
00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.960
And then your body starts
to produce adrenaline,

954
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.440
too much for the
heart to cope with.

955
00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.440
And you die unless someone
can snap you out of it.

956
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.320
And how did you work that out?

957
00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.800
Science.

958
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.080
Science and research.

959
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.640
It's what I do. And
Nancy assists me.

960
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.720
I bet she does.

961
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.160
[uplifting music]

962
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.880
[Archie] This is the stuff.

963
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.880
Oh, be careful, Archie.

964
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.120
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

965
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.200
This could be a very
valuable discovery.

966
00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.560
[uplifting music]

967
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.440
Valuable?

968
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.760
To the scientific community.

969
00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.920
A valuable source of knowledge.

970
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.280
And there was me thinking

971
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.560
that maybe we could
bottle it up and sell it.

972
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.600
[uplifting music]

973
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.040
Bloody hell, Archie,

974
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160
there's gotta be
some way of getting

975
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.680
some sort of value
out of this thing.

976
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.360
[uplifting music]

977
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.200
Look, I'm gonna level
with you, Archie.

978
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.960
I need to find a way of
making some money fast.

979
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.920
Well, we'll have to
sell the house eventually.

980
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:25.680
No, no, no.

981
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.320
Not eventually, Archie.

982
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.760
Now. Okay?

983
00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.520
See, I owe a lot of money.

984
00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.320
And if I don't find a way of
making this money by tomorrow,

985
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.120
I'm dead. [melancholy music]

986
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.520
Look, I don't know what to say.

987
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.760
Making money has never
really been my strong suit.

988
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.720
Even Nancy and I are worried

989
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.400
about how we'll manage
with Uncle Felix gone.

990
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.200
- You're bloody useless.
The pair of you are useless.

991
00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.720
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

992
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.480
[melancholy music]

993
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.240
What this?

994
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.040
Live on show tonight,
the Hottentot Venus.

995
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.760
I've heard about that.

996
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.200
It's terribly cruel.

997
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.200
Some poor African woman they've
put on show half undressed

998
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.480
for people to gawk at.

999
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.720
Tickets are thruppence a piece.

1000
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.160
They've gotta be raking it in,

1001
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.840
just to see this African woman

1002
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.360
I've seen her actually.

1003
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.080
You have?

1004
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.560
Oh, it was with the Academy.

1005
00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:45.240
All of us went for
educational purposes.

1006
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.600
[Nancy] It's no more
than a freak show.

1007
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.240
She has very unusual
physical characteristics.

1008
00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.880
That's a polite
way of saying it.

1009
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.160
I've got to get the dinner on.

1010
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.560
[rain whooshing]
[suspenseful music]

1011
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.920
What are you thinking?

1012
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.440
If they're willing
to play thruppence

1013
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.800
to see some woman from Africa,

1014
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.720
what would they
be willing to pay

1015
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.560
to see an actual ancient
Egyptian princess?

1016
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:36.920
Everett, you can't put
a dead body on display.

1017
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.760
Even if it is a
thousand-year-old dead princess.

1018
00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.200
I'm not talking
about a dead princess.

1019
00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.800
I'm talking about a live one.

1020
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.360
I'm sorry? What?

1021
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.040
Think about it, Archie.

1022
00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:55.440
A living, breathing historical
artifact from far-off Egypt.

1023
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.400
I mean, forget thruppence.

1024
00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.880
We could charge a pound pop

1025
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
and they'll still be
lining the streets outside.

1026
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.560
It's possible to
restart a heart, yeah?

1027
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.720
You said that someone
over in Finland did it.

1028
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.400
Luxembourg.

1029
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.600
And in that case, the patient
had been dead for 30 minutes,

1030
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.400
not 4,000 years.

1031
00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.880
What difference does it make?

1032
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Yeah, dead is dead.

1033
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.360
As long as all the
parts are in good nick.

1034
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.480
- This is ridiculous.
It's unthinkable.

1035
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.680
But it worked with
the rats, didn't it?

1036
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.560
How did you do that?

1037
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.240
Well, I gave them a
large shot of adrenaline.

1038
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.880
But rats are much simpler
beings than humans.

1039
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.400
There's the higher brain
function to consider.

1040
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.400
Even if we could
get her body going,

1041
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.040
who's to say what condition
the mind would be in.

1042
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:44.920
I mean, you've gotta admit,

1043
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.400
it's an intriguing idea.

1044
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.520
And if it worked,

1045
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.960
it would definitely make
your name as a doctor.

1046
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.000
I mean, Archie, you'd
be world famous.

1047
00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.400
The man that conquered death!

1048
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.120
And you and Nancy would
never need to worry

1049
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.600
about money ever again.

1050
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.320
[rain whooshing]
[suspenseful music]

1051
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.680
And neither would
you, I suppose.

1052
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.840
I'd only want my
fair share, Archie.

1053
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.360
And how much is your fair share,

1054
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.080
considering I'd be
doing most of the work?

1055
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.680
So you are considering it?

1056
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.920
Look, Everett,
it's not that simple.

1057
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.000
The body ought to be
perfectly preserved,

1058
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.800
but what if the mummification
processes failed?

1059
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.160
Or the organs, what if
they're all putrified?

1060
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.520
Let's get her out and
have a proper look then.

1061
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.800
Right now?

1062
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.680
There's no time like
the present, Archie.

1063
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.200
And I did say that I was
in a bit of a hurry, so...

1064
00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.360
[eerie music] [rain whooshing]

1065
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.840
All right, but we
have to do this quickly.

1066
00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.640
I don't want Nancy to
know about any of this.

1067
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.440
She'd be appalled at the idea.

1068
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.640
How do you know?

1069
00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.040
Because I'm
appalled at the idea.

1070
00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.640
But you are intrigued by
the possibility, aren't you?

1071
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.600
Against my better judgment.

1072
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.800
It must be that sense of
adventure Felix always spoke about.

1073
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.000
[rain whooshing]

1074
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.760
[door rumbling]

1075
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.440
I dunno why I keep closing this.

1076
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.600
I only end up opening
it back up again.

1077
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.160
Do you want a hand with it?

1078
00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.640
Grab the chisel.

1079
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.440
[bright suspenseful music]

1080
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.920
[wood creaks]

1081
00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.440
And now for the fun part.

1082
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.960
Let's crack it open.

1083
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.000
[bright suspenseful music]

1084
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.800
[chisel tapping]

1085
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.920
[metal clanks]

1086
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.240
[bright suspenseful music]

1087
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.640
Come on then, let's
have a proper look at her.

1088
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.320
Too dark to see anything
in that basement.

1089
00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.240
I wouldn't get your
hopes up, Everett.

1090
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.960
[eerie music]

1091
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:25.840
Giddy aunt.

1092
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.360
You know, I'm starting to think

1093
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.440
that people'd actually pay
just to see her like this.

1094
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.800
Well, she won't stay
like this for long.

1095
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.760
See, the sarcophagus
was sealed airtight.

1096
00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:41.640
Now that she's
out in the oxygen,

1097
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.200
her body's going
to start to atrophy

1098
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.000
unless I can get
her blood moving.

1099
00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:46.880
And then...

1100
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:50.600
What?

1101
00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.560
It's no use, Everett.

1102
00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.440
This is never going to work.

1103
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.800
In the case in Luxembourg,

1104
00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.920
the patient had only
been dead for 30 minutes.

1105
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.480
But I thought we agreed that...

1106
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.200
The purpose of blood
is to carry oxygen

1107
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.000
to all of the internal organs.

1108
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.800
If you say so.

1109
00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.560
Blood is oxygenated from the
lungs breathing in and out.

1110
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.440
Well, after 4,000
years in a sarcophagus,

1111
00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.640
any blood that
remains in her body,

1112
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.160
well, it's not going to
have any oxygen in it.

1113
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.520
Before we start her heart,

1114
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.480
we're going to have to
do a blood transfusion.

1115
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.840
[eerie music] [rain whooshing]

1116
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.600
What's that mean?

1117
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.560
It means we're
going to need blood.

1118
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.720
Fresh blood from a living,
breathing human volunteer.

1119
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.600
Well, don't look at me.

1120
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.640
Well, do you want
to do this or not?

1121
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.960
Yeah, of course.

1122
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.000
Then we need to
do it by tonight,

1123
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.640
before the body starts to decay.

1124
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.920
I've got an idea.

1125
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.240
[suspenseful music]
[rain whooshing]

1126
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.760
Have you got a
penny I can borrow?

1127
00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.560
- Whatever for?
[coin clinks]

1128
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.040
Wait and see, Archie.

1129
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.800
Wait and see.

1130
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.560
Look, I need to nip out.

1131
00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.400
I'll be back later tonight.

1132
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.320
You're going out?

1133
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.560
But we need to open her up.

1134
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.120
We need to check the
condition of her organs.

1135
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.400
Oh Christ. You don't need
me to help you with that.

1136
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.280
No, I suppose not.

1137
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.680
But it is going
to take some time.

1138
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.120
I have to put everything back
exactly where I found it.

1139
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.800
Well, you better get on
with it then, hadn't you?

1140
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.160
I'll

1141
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.720
see you later.

1142
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.480
[rain pattering]

1143
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.520
[thunder rumbles]
[rain whooshing]

1144
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.200
[Archie] I'm sorry-

1145
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.280
- It doesn't matter.

1146
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.280
No, I mean about Everett.

1147
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.240
Everett's always
been a bit difficult.

1148
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.800
[melancholy music]

1149
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.560
But having seen the way the
family have treated him,

1150
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.800
I can hardly blame him.

1151
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.200
I can hardly believe the
two of you are related.

1152
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.920
Well, we might not be actually.

1153
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.080
Rumor at the time was that
Everett's father, my uncle,

1154
00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.960
was not actually his father,

1155
00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.600
if you know what I mean.

1156
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.960
It was a big
scandal at the time.

1157
00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.720
Tarnished the family name.
[melancholy music]

1158
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.840
So the entire family
shunned Everett.

1159
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.480
I see.

1160
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.200
Plus his father was
an inveterate gambler.

1161
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.240
He lost fortunes at
the card tables so

1162
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.000
Everett had to make his
own way in the world.

1163
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.400
And is the family name
still important to you?

1164
00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.280
- What do you mean?
[melancholy music]

1165
00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.160
If people found
out about you and me,

1166
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.120
would you be ashamed of me?

1167
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.560
No. Of course not.

1168
00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.480
[melancholy music]

1169
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.120
But you know how people are.

1170
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.480
It still feels funny sitting
at this table with you,

1171
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.560
instead of eating by
myself in the kitchen.

1172
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.240
I do miss Dr. Randolph,

1173
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.160
but it's so nice just to
be myself around the house

1174
00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.280
instead of keeping
everything secret.

1175
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.240
[melancholy music]

1176
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.200
What is it, Archie?

1177
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.040
Is something wrong?

1178
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.440
I have never kept
secrets, Nancy.

1179
00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.600
Not from you, I mean.

1180
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.200
I know that, Archie.

1181
00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.560
So if I asked you to
trust me, would you?

1182
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.760
- What are you getting at?
[melancholy music]

1183
00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.360
Me and Everett, we're
working on something.

1184
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.320
Oh no. What has
he talked you into?

1185
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.160
It's something that
could be incredible.

1186
01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.440
It could be fantastic.

1187
01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.160
It could solve all
of our problems.

1188
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.760
Or...

1189
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.640
Or what?

1190
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.320
Or it could be a
horrible nightmare.

1191
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.040
And for that reason,
after dinner, Nancy,

1192
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.520
I want you to go to your room
and stay there until morning.

1193
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.520
Do not come out, no
matter what you hear.

1194
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.640
What on earth are
you talking about?

1195
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.440
Please, Nancy.

1196
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.800
Promise me.

1197
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.920
But what if you
get into trouble?

1198
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.280
Is it something to do
with that sarcophagus?

1199
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.520
- No. No.
[suspenseful music]

1200
01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.240
We won't be going
near that again.

1201
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.880
I still don't like
the sound of this.

1202
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.440
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1203
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.920
I know.

1204
01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.240
And I knew you wouldn't,

1205
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.120
but I have to try this.

1206
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.200
And if it does work,

1207
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.080
we'd never have to
worry about money again.

1208
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640
All right, Archie.

1209
01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440
I trust you.

1210
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.080
But I don't trust your cousin.

1211
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.400
Neither do I.

1212
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.520
But I don't think I can
do this without him.

1213
01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.880

[thunder rumbles]

1215
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.560
Remember what I said.

1216
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.120
Stay in your room tonight.

1217
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.160
We'll know if we've
succeeded by the morning.

1218
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.360
It isn't something
dangerous, is it?

1219
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.200
I don't know.

1220
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.000
I don't think so.

1221
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.240
And you're sure Everett
isn't forcing you?

1222
01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.800
I'll admit, he can
be very persuasive.

1223
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.880
If at any time I don't feel
like I'm doing the right thing,

1224
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.360
I'll put a stop to it.

1225
01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.400
All right?

[bright suspenseful music]

1227
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.560

- [Felix Voiceover]
So there it was,

1233
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.360
the truth about Khenmetptah.

1234
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.720
There was no other such
case in recorded history,

1235
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.960
making my find
absolutely unique.

1236
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.440
Unique, and yet so grim

1237
01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.840
I feared no museum would
ever dare exhibit it.

Is it yours?

No.

What is it that you
want me to do then?

1246
01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.560
Look, I've already said.

1247
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.480
It's hard to explain.

Pleased to meet you, Archie.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.720
Thank you for agreeing to come.

1253
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.560
So how's it going?

1254
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.640
Fine.

1255
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.920
How were the innards?

1256
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.640
Fine.

1257
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.480
Well, rather
extraordinary, actually.

1258
01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.280
So we're in business then.

1259
01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.520
Look, Everett,

1260
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.280
I've been reading
Uncle Felix's journal.

1261
01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.320
There's some more information
here regarding our-

1262
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.760
- It sounds beautiful.

1263
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.440
Maybe you could tell
me about that later.

1264
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.760
Sorry to interrupt
you two gentlemen,

1265
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.280
but what is it exactly
that you wanted me to do?

1266
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.080
You haven't told
her why she's here?

1267
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.720
Well, I thought it would
be better coming from you.

1268
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.520
God.

1269
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.520
All right.

1270
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.480
Shelly, is it?

1271
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.880
Why don't you lay on the bed?

1272
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.400
[bright suspenseful music]

1273
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.320
I knew it.

1274
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.480
With the two of
you at once, is it?

1275
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.000
No, no, no, no, no.

1276
01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.880
You got me here
under false pretenses.

1277
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.640
You did say that you would
do anything for a penny.

1278
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.200
I didn't mean that.

1279
01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.760
I might be a beggar,
but I'm not a whore!

1280
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.560
If I may, all we need
is some of your blood.

1281
01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.200
[bright suspenseful music]

1282
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.640
What the bleeding hell is this?

1283
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.600
Look, we can explain.

1284
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.120
Help. Help! Police!

1285
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.000
Murder!

1286
01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.920
Let me go!

1287
01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.560
Get off me! Let me go!

1288
01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.040
Calm down!

1289
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.640
Get off me! Get off
of me, you murderers!

1290
01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.640
[blow thuds]

1291
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.640
[rain whooshing]

1292
01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.480
Well, this is just great.

1293
01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.360
Hold on.

1294
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.600
It's all right.

1295
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.040
She's just out cold.

1296
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.720
This is not right, Everett.

1297
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.920
This is awful.

1298
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:21.880
Come on.

1299
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.760
Help me get her up on the bed.

1300
01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.200
I promised Nancy that if,

1301
01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.920
at any point, I felt
uncomfortable with this,

1302
01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.400
I would put a stop to it.

1303
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.640
Oh yeah?

1304
01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.880
In any case, the girl
will never agree to it.

1305
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.840
Well, she doesn't
have to now, does she?

1306
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.840
You can just do your thing.

1307
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.160
While she's unconscious?

1308
01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.720
That is entirely unethical.

1309
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.760
Nevermind dangerous!

1310
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.240
How would we know if we've
taken too much blood?

1311
01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.160
This whole thing is
becoming intolerable.

1312
01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.400
[suspenseful music]

1313
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.280
Is it?

1314
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.240
Yes, it is.

1315
01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.880
And I haven't even told
you the worst of it.

1316
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.440
Has it never even
occurred to you

1317
01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.200
as to why the princess was
interred at such a young age?

1318
01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.440
How she died?

1319
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.680
No, Archie, it
didn't occur to me.

1320
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.440
And, what's more, I don't care.

1321
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.080
But if you are thinking
of backing out on me,

1322
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.880
I got news for you.

1323
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.440
While I was out,

1324
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.320
I popped in to see my pal
over at the newspaper.

1325
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.400
He was delighted when I
gave him this little tip

1326
01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.880
about this young heir
from a well-to-do family

1327
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.360
who's been caught having his
wicked way with the maid.

1328
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.320
You know how much the
press love a scandal.

1329
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.120
Especially when it
involves a Randolph.

1330
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.000
They're going to print that?

1331
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.880
Not if I put a stop to it. No.

1332
01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.600
What?

1333
01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.520
They call it a
dead-man's switch, Archie.

1334
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.800
Every day I go into the office,

1335
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.200
I tell 'em to put an
hold on the story.

1336
01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.920
But when that day comes that
I don't show up, well...

1337
01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.960
It goes to print.

1338
01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.080
[suspenseful music]

1339
01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.840
We're doing this, Archie,
whether you like it or not.

1340
01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.960
[suspenseful music]

1341
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.760
[thunder rumbling]
[rain whooshing]

1342
01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.520
[eerie music]

1343
01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.040
There.

1344
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.720
The transfusion has begun.

1345
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.720
So how long is
this gonna take then?

1346
01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.560
Well, the average person

1347
01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.360
has about eight pints
of blood in their body.

1348
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.280
Now, that's what carries
oxygen to all of the organs.

1349
01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.600
Naturally, we can't
take all eight pints.

1350
01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.480
Why's that?

1351
01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.200
She would die.

1352
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.800
Right.

1353
01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.400
All we need is enough

1354
01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.880
to get the heart pumping
the blood around the body.

1355
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.840
And then once the
organs start to work,

1356
01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.120
the princess's body will start

1357
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.880
to generate its
own blood supply.

1358
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.680
And how do we know when
we've got enough blood?

1359
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.280
I have no idea.

1360
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.640
To be honest, this
is all guesswork.

1361
01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.080
Guesswork?

1362
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.440
I thought you was
meant to be a doctor.

1363
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.920
This isn't exactly
what doctors do, Everett.

1364
01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.160
So what happens
after this blood trans-

1365
01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.360
- Well, there comes
the hard part.

1366
01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.000
We need adrenaline.

1367
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.360
I've only ever
done that on rats.

1368
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.200
Done what?

1369
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.600
Extracted it.

1370
01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.480
Pure adrenaline.

1371
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.960
4,000-year-old heart, it's
going need a rather large dose.

1372
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.800
Now the body only creates
it under certain conditions.

1373
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.920
When they're scared, right?

1374
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.760
See, I was listening.

1375
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.560
And I was never exactly
sure on how we were going to-

1376
01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.360
[suspenseful music]

1377
01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.040
[woman gasping]

1378
01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.120
Is she waking up?

1379
01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.200
No, she looks too weak.

1380
01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.600
[woman gasping]

1381
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.520
Shelly, Shelly, wake up!

1382
01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.600
Shelly!

1383
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.720
[woman groans]

1384
01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.640
[Everett] What are you doing?

1385
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.400
She's losing too much blood.

1386
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.960
I've got to turn it off.

1387
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.720
What if it's not enough
blood to wake up the princess?

1388
01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.320
Everett, she's going to die.

1389
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.560
Leave it a bit longer.

1390
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.480
[Shelly gasping]
[suspenseful music]

1391
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.720
I said leave it.

1392
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.440
[Shelly gasping]

1393
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.120
[ominous music]

1394
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.480
She's dead.

1395
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.440
This is over.

1396
01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.920
Nah, it's not over
until I say it is.

1397
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.760
- A girl has died.
[dramatic music]

1398
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.720
Well better her than me.

1399
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.760
[blow thuds]

1400
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.240
[men grunting]
[suspenseful music]

1401
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.160
What's going on?

1402
01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.280
Nancy, I told you
not to come down.

1403
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400
How could I stay upstairs

1404
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.560
with all the crashing
and the screaming and...

1405
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.520
Get back.

1406
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.120
Archie, what's going on?

1407
01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.280
It's okay, Nancy.

1408
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.520
It's over now.

1409
01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.880
[suspenseful music]

1410
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.160
[Nancy gasps]

1411
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.960
It's not over, Archie.

1412
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.520
Not by a long shot.

1413
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.360
Now, we've got Egyptian
princess over there

1414
01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480
full of fresh blood.

1415
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.520
And you are gonna
restart her heart.

1416
01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.320
[suspenseful music]

1417
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.040
Everett, I can't.

1418
01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.360
Not now that Shelly's dead.

1419
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.520
I can't extract
adrenaline from a corpse.

1420
01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.400
I need a working adrenal gland.

1421
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.080
I suppose we're gonna
need a new volunteer.

1422
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.440
No, no, I won't do it.

1423
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.200
I don't care if
you blackmail me.

1424
01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.640
Well, if you don't do it,

1425
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.000
then your little maid here
is gonna get a little bullet

1426
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.760
in the back of her little head.

1427
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.880
[suspenseful music]

1428
01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.560
There's a chair.

1429
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.600
Now tie her up nice and tight.

1430
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.680
[suspenseful music]

1431
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.160
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

1432
01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.920
Don't worry, Archie.

1433
01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:57.760
I'm not scared.

1434
01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.760
You say you're not scared, eh?

1435
01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.920
Well I just won't do, will it?

1436
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.640
That won't get the old
adrenaline pumping.

1437
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.360
But luckily I've got something

1438
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.320
that will help us
along with that.

1439
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.960
[suspenseful music]

1440
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.240
- [Archie] No!
It's too dangerous.

1441
01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.520
But it works, doesn't it?

1442
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.200
You said so yourself.

1443
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.480
A little bit of this
on the skin will soon

1444
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.200
get those glands
working overtime.

1445
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.280
Use me instead.

1446
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.080
Put it on me.

1447
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.520
Use my adrenaline.

1448
01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.400
That's very
commendable, that, Archie.

1449
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.000
But who's gonna extract it?

1450

[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1451
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.440
Get outta the way.

1452
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.520
Just a little bit, Nancy.

1453
01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.560
We don't want you
having a attack

1454
01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.600
before we're ready now, do we?

1455
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.560

[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1457
01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.560
Listen, Nancy, whatever you see,

1458
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.760
just remember it isn't real.

1459
01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.240
Haven't you got work to do?

1460
01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.720
Jesus!

1461
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.760
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1462
01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.000
What are you doing? What's that?

1463
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.640
An anatomy book.

1464
01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.360
I've never done this
on a human before.

1465
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.800
I need to get the location

1466
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.600
of the adrenal
gland exactly right.

1467
01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.120

God, it's starting!

1470
01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.040
Come over here and
help me, damn it!

1471
01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.280
Hold her still.

[dramatic music]

1473
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.920
Do it.

[rain pattering]

1478
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.240
It didn't work.

1479
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:28.760
What?

1480
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.520
It didn't work, Everett.

1481
01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.480
There was only ever
a small chance.

1482
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.320
A small chance?

A small chance?
[suspenseful music]

1487
01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.840
This was life or
death for me, Archie.

1488
01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.320
And you knew that.

1489
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.360
You Randolphs are all the same.

1490
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.600
Always treated me like dirt
on the bottom of your shoe.

1491
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.480
Denied me of my,
my, inheritance!

[Princess Khenmetptah gasps]

1493

[Everett gasps] [ominous music]

1497
01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.560
What's she doing?

1498
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.640
I tried to tell you, Everett.

1499
01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.560
She's a killer, a murderer!

1500
01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.400
They didn't mummify
her because she died.

1501
01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.560
She was buried alive!

[Felix Voiceover] There
is one item so dangerous

it must never see
the light of day.

It's a shame to have to
say goodbye to the old place.

We've no choice, Archie.

1522

Not since they printed
that news story.

I love you, Nancy, and
I don't care who knows.

That's easy for you to say,

I'd rather not have people
pointing and whispering

every time I go into
town to get groceries.

We would've had to have
moved sooner or later.

1528
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.000
I can't keep a house like
this, not on a doctor's salary.

What did you do
with it in the end?

1530

With what?

Felix requested,

I've moved it back
down to the basement.

1535
01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.000
And there's a group of
builders coming this afternoon

1536
01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.480
to seal it with brick.

I hear the houses in
Coventry are cheap

and there's an urgent
shortage of doctors.

even heard of a Randolph.
