<i>When we take it upon ourselves</i>

<i>to act against
our best interests...</i>

7
00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:56.527
...and the best interests
of our community,

8
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:59.195
we have to understand that
there are consequences

9
00:01:59.228 --> 00:02:00.364
for those actions.

10
00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:03.668
And we must respect

11
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.670
the hierarchy of power

12
00:02:05.703 --> 00:02:08.740
as it is handed down
to us from God.

13
00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:12.342
I did not ask for
this responsibility.

14
00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:15.712
I did rise to power
under my own volition,

15
00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:17.615
but the drive to do so

16
00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.518
was placed inside of me
by a higher power.

- Jimmy...
- [sniffles]

18
00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:26.389
[Clark] It's God's will
that I stand here today...

19
00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:32.629
to take a hard look
at your lives, people.

20
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.402
You believe that anything
happens without the will of God.

21
00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:40.872
If it were God's will
that He wanted one of you

- to be in charge...
- Hey, Briggs.

23
00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:44.418
[Clark] ...do you not think He
would have given you the drive?

24
00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.411
Keep a sharp eye out
for the brother.

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:48.478
Boss thinks he might
try something.

26
00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:50.682
[Clark] He did not.

27
00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:53.617
God blessed me with the means

28
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:55.151
and the mental fortitude

29
00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:57.655
to grow my interests
in this community.

30
00:02:57.688 --> 00:03:01.358
Not only was I able to open up
Clark's Mercantile and Trade,

31
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.326
but I was able to
lure in the railroad.

Now I know that many of you do
not agree with my methods.

Let me assure you
Mister McCallister

Don't stay here and watch this.

You hear me, son?

You go on home!

Well, your father is teaching
you a valuable lesson.

Yes, he did. Yes, he did!

He stole from
all these good people.

52
00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:58.650
That makes him a sinner.

you do other things.

So no arguing.
Grab your school books

and scoot before
you're both late.

I think you and your father

could use a little
walk together anyway.

- Wouldn't we be faster on the horse?
- Undoubtedly.

Then wouldn't the time
we save by being faster

126
00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:13.496
have made up for the time
it would have taken

Well, I'll tell you,
Mister Briggs.

153
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:30.634
My mother done got it
in her head yesterday

154
00:11:30.668 --> 00:11:31.902
that she wanted to bake a cake

155
00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:33.245
for the church potluck
this weekend.

156
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:35.407
And now last year,
she made a pie,

157
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.142
but the apples she used grew on
Mister Johnson's apple tree.

158
00:11:38.174 --> 00:11:40.945
You know, the one out back
by the outhouse?

159
00:11:40.977 --> 00:11:43.681
And wouldn't you know it,
them apples tasted plum-like shit

and made anybody who eat
them sick to they gut.

from that outhouse

has soaked down to the root

163
00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:52.155
and changed the way
a basic apple can taste.

164
00:11:52.188 --> 00:11:55.091
But Mister Johnson says
that's a bunch of hooey,

165
00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:57.827
and because of that, he won't
let Mama have no more apples

166
00:11:57.861 --> 00:12:00.397
for her apple pie, which,
as far as I'm concerned,

167
00:12:00.432 --> 00:12:03.933
is fine by me and Mama
because as I mentioned before,

168

like shit anyhow.

00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:38.403
The sack she has
is full of weevils

182
00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:40.480
and she don't think she can
sift them all out this time.

183
00:12:40.504 --> 00:12:41.772
How many pounds?

184
00:12:41.804 --> 00:12:43.774
Just a 20-pound bag'll do.

185
00:12:43.807 --> 00:12:46.243
[footsteps ascend]

186
00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:04.360
[whispering] I didn't, uh,
I didn't see you there.

187
00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:07.465
I wasn't really gonna steal 'em.

188
00:13:07.499 --> 00:13:10.167
It's just a game
I play with your daddy.

189
00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:11.335
[footsteps descend]

190
00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:15.038
Twenty pounds of flour.

191
00:13:15.072 --> 00:13:16.508
That'll be one dollar
and a nickel.

192
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:18.107
[register dings]

193
00:13:18.142 --> 00:13:20.477
Yeah, could you apply it
to my mother's account?

194
00:13:20.511 --> 00:13:23.913
- [Briggs] Of course.
- Thank you, Mister Briggs.

195
00:13:23.947 --> 00:13:25.816
Hope to see you
at the luncheon on Sunday.

196
00:13:26.383 --> 00:13:27.383
Madam.

197
00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:32.456
[door opens, closes]

198
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.024
Have you finished
reading your book?

199
00:13:34.057 --> 00:13:37.126
He tried to steal
some jelly beans.

200
00:13:38.962 --> 00:13:40.898
- What?
- [Brooke] That man.

201
00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:44.902
Mr. Jeffries?

202
00:13:44.934 --> 00:13:46.471
I caught him taking
some jelly beans

203
00:13:46.504 --> 00:13:48.172
and he put them back.

204
00:13:48.205 --> 00:13:49.740
He put them back?

205
00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:53.376
He did.

206
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:56.279
I'll discuss this with him
next time he's in my store.

207
00:14:01.351 --> 00:14:03.052
You want one?

208
00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:04.086
No.

209
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:06.756
Then what do you want?

210
00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:10.027
His hands were dirty.

211
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.243
[jaunty music playing]

212
00:15:50.927 --> 00:15:51.928
[birds chirping]

213
00:16:05.409 --> 00:16:07.511
- [Ruth gasps]
- Pardon me, ma'am.

214
00:16:07.544 --> 00:16:09.078
I didn't mean to frighten you.

215
00:16:10.715 --> 00:16:12.081
We weren't sure if
anyone was home.

216
00:16:13.082 --> 00:16:15.052
Someone is home.

217
00:16:15.085 --> 00:16:17.120
Me. How can I help you?

218
00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:19.322
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:23.461
First, me apologize for the
rudeness of my introduction.

220
00:16:23.495 --> 00:16:25.361
My name is James McCallister,

221
00:16:25.395 --> 00:16:26.972
and me and my companions
have been on the road

222
00:16:26.996 --> 00:16:28.633
for several days now.

223
00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:31.568
We're plum tired and we're
more than a little lost.

224
00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:34.706
"Companions?"

225
00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:37.039
Uh, yes, ma'am.

226
00:16:37.073 --> 00:16:39.510
That's Boots there,
out by the road.

227
00:16:39.543 --> 00:16:42.211
He didn't want to ride up to
the house and frighten folks.

228
00:16:42.245 --> 00:16:43.615
He's being polite.

229
00:16:43.648 --> 00:16:47.183
And behind you,
well, that's Big Mike.

230
00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:48.620
Thousand pardons, Miss.

231
00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:50.721
I was just around back
checking to see if

232
00:16:50.754 --> 00:16:52.956
there's anybody in your garden.

233
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.525
Was there?

234
00:16:54.558 --> 00:16:55.559
Nope.

235
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.996
You gentlemen should
have just knocked.

236
00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:01.130
Well, we did knock, ma'am.

237
00:17:01.164 --> 00:17:03.100
Hm, that's true.

238
00:17:03.133 --> 00:17:06.202
saw Big Mike step up to
that door and give it a rap.

239
00:17:06.236 --> 00:17:08.472
Most definitely witnessed
that with mine own.

240
00:17:10.073 --> 00:17:11.576
Must not have knocked too loud.

241
00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:14.211
I certainly didn't
hear it in the house.

242
00:17:14.243 --> 00:17:16.113
[chuckles]

243
00:17:16.145 --> 00:17:18.583
Nevertheless...

244
00:17:18.615 --> 00:17:20.652
Well, if you gentlemen will
just allow me a moment

245
00:17:20.684 --> 00:17:22.352
to put the laundry down,

246
00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:27.089
I will happily point you
in the direction of town.

247
00:17:27.124 --> 00:17:30.160
It's about a half hour's
walk up the road.

248
00:17:30.193 --> 00:17:32.195
And they've got hotels
and saloons,

249
00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:34.531
and a hot bath house
with a brand-new shower.

250
00:17:34.566 --> 00:17:36.567
Well, that would be
an act of kindness, ma'am.

251
00:17:36.601 --> 00:17:38.470
[Big Mike] We'd be much obliged.

252
00:17:38.502 --> 00:17:41.405
My husband will be along
any minute,

253
00:17:41.439 --> 00:17:44.509
so he might even be able to
show you the way himself.

254
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.176
Your husband?

255
00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:49.078
Yes, sir. My husband.

256
00:17:49.112 --> 00:17:51.415
He should be along any moment.

257
00:17:51.449 --> 00:17:53.016
Would your husband
happen to have been

258
00:17:53.049 --> 00:17:56.252
that feller we saw walking
down the road earlier?

259
00:17:56.286 --> 00:17:57.521
Walking with a little girl?

260
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.125
Yes, he was walking
our daughter to school.

261
00:18:02.159 --> 00:18:06.530
[James and Mike laugh]

262
00:18:06.564 --> 00:18:08.198
[James] Oh, ain't
that somethin'?

263
00:18:08.231 --> 00:18:12.436
A grown man walking
a little girl to school.

264
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.203
We certainly live in a new age.

265
00:18:14.238 --> 00:18:18.107
- Sure does seem like it.
- [James] Sure does.

266
00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:21.679
You said town's about a half
an hour walk up the road?

267
00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:23.580
That's right.

268
00:18:23.615 --> 00:18:27.150
Hm. Well...

269
00:18:27.183 --> 00:18:29.185
your man sure been
gone a long time

270
00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:31.419
if he was just walking your
daughter to school and back.

271
00:18:34.659 --> 00:18:37.094
Sure hope nothin' happened
to hold him up.

272
00:18:39.797 --> 00:18:40.832
[grunts]

273
00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:42.567
[Ruth screams]

274
00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:44.402
[groans]

275
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.372
Go help him.

276
00:18:48.405 --> 00:18:50.339
- [groans]
- You all right?

277
00:18:50.374 --> 00:18:52.108
The bitch kicked me
in the balls.

278
00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:54.778
You got your ass whooped by an
unarmed woman doing her laundry.

279
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:57.180
- Yeah.
- You sure you have balls?

280
00:18:57.213 --> 00:19:01.451
[suspenseful music playing]

281
00:19:01.486 --> 00:19:02.619
[pants]

282
00:19:14.163 --> 00:19:16.266
- [knocking]
- Open up, Missy.

283
00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:20.237
I'm coming in
one way or another.

284
00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:22.574
Might as well not
piss us off in the meantime.

285
00:19:22.606 --> 00:19:24.207
[latch clicks]

286
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.118
- [guns cocking]
- [James] Madam...

287
00:19:36.153 --> 00:19:39.557
I think you got the wrong idea
about me and the fellas.

288
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:44.561
Ain't no sense
runnin' off and hidin'.

289
00:19:44.596 --> 00:19:46.798
We don't want to hurt nobody.

290
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.499
We need to quit peckerin' around

291
00:19:48.532 --> 00:19:50.166
and get back on the trail.

292
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.703
That marshal can't
be too far behind.

293
00:19:52.737 --> 00:19:55.440
A day, day and a half at most.

294
00:19:55.472 --> 00:19:56.840
We need to keep moving

295
00:19:56.874 --> 00:19:59.175
unless you fools
want to end up back in jail.

296
00:19:59.209 --> 00:20:01.578
Eustice, shut your damn mouth.

297
00:20:01.613 --> 00:20:04.615
Now I know you're scared
and you're hiding.

298
00:20:04.648 --> 00:20:06.750
If you'll just
poke your head out,

299
00:20:06.784 --> 00:20:08.452
you'll see we don't
got any guns.

300
00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:10.821
We just want to talk.

301
00:20:13.657 --> 00:20:14.657
[whistles quietly]

302
00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:21.465
[neighing]

303
00:20:24.868 --> 00:20:27.170
[suspenseful music]

304
00:20:27.838 --> 00:20:28.839
[gunshot]

305
00:20:28.873 --> 00:20:30.607
[horse whinnies]

306
00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:36.246
[Eustice exclaims]

307
00:20:38.382 --> 00:20:40.451
[James]
Go on. Go get her.

308
00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:41.685
Bring her back.

309
00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:43.252
[horse neighs]

310
00:20:43.286 --> 00:20:44.555
[grunts]

311
00:20:45.522 --> 00:20:47.825
[screams]

312
00:20:47.858 --> 00:20:50.359
[grunts]

313
00:20:52.596 --> 00:20:55.231
[Ruth pants, grunts]

314
00:20:59.336 --> 00:21:00.738
[grunts]

315
00:21:04.675 --> 00:21:05.942
- You gon' live?
- Yeah.

316
00:21:22.426 --> 00:21:24.561
Bring her over! Quickly now!

317
00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:30.867
[groans]

318
00:21:33.904 --> 00:21:35.707
Her arm's all busted up.

319
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.509
That's fine. That's fine.

320
00:21:38.542 --> 00:21:41.679
- [groans]
- [James] I feel like we got off to a bad start.

321
00:21:41.712 --> 00:21:43.847
And I'm going to
put that on you.

322
00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:47.818
Now, when we first met,
I introduced myself, did I not?

323
00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:51.521
I said my name, loud and clear.

324
00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:55.692
You did not do me
the same honor. Did ya'?

325
00:21:58.061 --> 00:22:01.999
I said, did ya'?

326
00:22:02.032 --> 00:22:04.634
You'll get no honor from me.

327
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:06.303
Tell me this then, huh?

328
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:11.541
Is this your husband? Hm?

329
00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:14.612
Is he the man we saw walking
down the street this morning?

330
00:22:14.644 --> 00:22:17.781
Is your husband
the Colton Briggs?

331
00:22:17.815 --> 00:22:19.916
Heard of my husband, have you?

332
00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:25.056
[laughs] Oh, I've certainly
heard of your husband.

333
00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:27.324
We're like family, me and him.

334
00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:29.527
Good.

335
00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:33.029
That saves me the trouble
of explaining it to you.

336
00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:37.969
You boys are in a world...

337
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:39.971
of hurt.

338
00:22:41.672 --> 00:22:43.074
Who the shit is Colton Briggs?

339
00:22:43.106 --> 00:22:44.407
[Eustice]
Are you serious?

340
00:22:44.442 --> 00:22:46.343
Colton Briggs?

341
00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:47.979
This is Colton Briggs' place?

342
00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:49.614
Eustice, quiet.

343
00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:50.781
That's right.

344
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:54.951
[grunts] And I'm his wife.

345
00:22:57.555 --> 00:22:59.457
And you hit me...

346
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.625
in the face with your gun.

347
00:23:04.595 --> 00:23:05.730
Broke my arm.

348
00:23:06.864 --> 00:23:08.965
Shot his horse.

349
00:23:14.137 --> 00:23:17.607
You boys have woke up the devil.

350
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.113
- [laughs]
- [Eustice] God damn it, Jimmy.

351
00:23:22.145 --> 00:23:24.515
You bringing hell down on us!

352
00:23:24.548 --> 00:23:28.685
I absolutely
know your husband, hm.

353
00:23:30.054 --> 00:23:31.354
We go way back.

354
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.125
In fact, I owe him a debt.

355
00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:37.862
[tense music building]

356
00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:47.003
[Briggs] That'll do.

357
00:23:47.038 --> 00:23:48.605
It's time to head home.

358
00:23:52.108 --> 00:23:54.578
Mama didn't come
to get me from school.

359
00:23:54.612 --> 00:23:57.114
You weren't at school.
You were here.

360
00:23:57.147 --> 00:23:58.816
Yes, but wouldn't she
come here to find me

361
00:23:58.849 --> 00:24:00.550
if I wasn't at school?

362
00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:03.421

00:24:17.468 --> 00:24:18.979
- [horses neigh]
- [Deputy] Hey, Marshal!

365
00:24:19.002 --> 00:24:20.837
You better come on out here.

366
00:24:27.612 --> 00:24:29.713
Who are those men?

367
00:24:29.747 --> 00:24:32.016
[Marshal] What do we got here?
The family?

368
00:24:32.048 --> 00:24:33.693
Maybe it looks like
the father and the daughter

369
00:24:33.718 --> 00:24:35.384
from that picture
on the mantle in there.

370
00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:44.161
[Marshal] They must've been away
when those fellas came through.

371
00:24:44.194 --> 00:24:46.163
Thank God they're okay.

372
00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:47.964
A little bit of luck, finally.

373
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.535
Lucky, indeed.

374
00:24:54.238 --> 00:24:55.906
Tell the others to come outside.

375
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.550
We shouldn't be making
ourselves comfortable

376
00:24:57.575 --> 00:24:58.608
in these folks' home.

377
00:25:04.714 --> 00:25:06.182
[Deputy] Hey, you guys...

378
00:25:06.217 --> 00:25:08.219
family's here.

379
00:25:08.251 --> 00:25:10.054
- They're still alive?
- Yup.

380
00:25:12.222 --> 00:25:13.891
Oh, shit.

381
00:25:16.227 --> 00:25:18.930
- [horse neighs]
- This you folks home?

382
00:25:23.867 --> 00:25:26.170
I want to apologize for my men.

383
00:25:26.202 --> 00:25:29.874
We, uh, we didn't realize that
no one was home and...

384
00:25:29.906 --> 00:25:31.075
My wife was home.

385
00:25:34.211 --> 00:25:36.614
Yes, sir. l... uh...

386
00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:39.482
I apologize again.

387
00:25:39.517 --> 00:25:41.585
My name is US Marshall
Franklin Jarrett.

388
00:25:41.618 --> 00:25:42.853
I know who you are.

389
00:25:43.921 --> 00:25:45.088
Where's Ruth?

390
00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.927
I'm afraid you have me
at a loss, sir.

391
00:25:51.895 --> 00:25:53.230
Do I know you?

392
00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:01.672
Briggs?

393
00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:06.676
Well holy shit, man.

394
00:26:07.278 --> 00:26:08.278
I, uh...

395
00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:13.017
I apologize, little lady.

396
00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:15.019
That language is, uh,
not appropriate.

397
00:26:18.122 --> 00:26:19.856
You have a family?

398
00:26:25.296 --> 00:26:28.566
Well, that is a good thing.

399
00:26:28.598 --> 00:26:33.237
A man needs a family.
It, uh, grounds him.

400
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:35.638
Evens him out.
That is... this is good.

401
00:26:35.673 --> 00:26:37.575
Marshal...

402
00:26:45.883 --> 00:26:47.617
I'm sorry, Briggs, but...

403
00:26:49.086 --> 00:26:50.186
we need to talk.

404
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:55.259
Somewhere private, preferably.

405
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:58.261
[somber music playing]

406
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.202
Why don't you boys go
help him dig that hole?

407
00:27:07.704 --> 00:27:09.272
Says he don't want our help.

408
00:27:09.306 --> 00:27:11.241
Says we should've been
better at our jobs.

409
00:27:11.275 --> 00:27:13.144
[Jarrett] He ain't wrong.

410
00:27:13.176 --> 00:27:15.645
- Go get them horses ready.
- Hmm.

411
00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:17.213
[shovel hitting dirt]

412
00:27:25.355 --> 00:27:28.224
Little lady...

413
00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:31.228
I had Smiley heat up
some of that condensed milk

414
00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:32.930
and put a little
brown sugar in it.

415
00:27:32.962 --> 00:27:35.031
It's good. Make you feel better.

416
00:27:48.878 --> 00:27:50.780
I never knew your mama.

417
00:27:52.215 --> 00:27:54.117
But I know she was a good woman.

418
00:27:56.287 --> 00:27:57.755
But I did know your daddy.

419
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.157
Years and years ago.

420
00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:05.162
You meet a lot of people
in this business,

421
00:28:05.195 --> 00:28:08.398
and the faces, a lot of times,
just disappear over the years.

422
00:28:08.432 --> 00:28:11.734
But not your daddy.

423
00:28:11.769 --> 00:28:14.371
[chuckles] No, sir. Not him.

424
00:28:16.906 --> 00:28:18.308
Your daddy was about

425
00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:21.878
the meanest son of a bitch
I ever met.

426
00:28:21.912 --> 00:28:24.147
Pardon my language, but...

427
00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:26.182
I never met anybody like him.

428
00:28:28.085 --> 00:28:30.121
Just the way he would
look at you, just...

429
00:28:32.256 --> 00:28:34.191
like he was looking through you.

430
00:28:35.792 --> 00:28:37.361
Like you were nothing.

431
00:28:41.432 --> 00:28:43.032
And I don't say this lightly,

432
00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:47.037
but y... your daddy
was a violent man.

433
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.441
I've seen him shoot
three cowboys one time.

434
00:28:49.473 --> 00:28:51.174
Now it was a fair fight, but...

435
00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:54.211
I don't think his blood
raised an ounce.

436
00:28:54.244 --> 00:28:56.146
I can't say he was a criminal.

437
00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.317
I don't know that,
but I can say that he...

438
00:29:00.351 --> 00:29:02.720
was not what I would
call a "good man."

439
00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:05.756
Not back then.

440
00:29:07.724 --> 00:29:09.192
Why are you telling me this?

441
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:12.761
Hm.

442
00:29:17.902 --> 00:29:20.237
I guess I just want you
to understand...

443
00:29:22.105 --> 00:29:24.240
how good a woman your mama was.

444
00:29:24.275 --> 00:29:28.378
She took the coldest killer
that I've ever met,

445
00:29:28.413 --> 00:29:31.015
and she turned him
into a family man.

446
00:29:31.048 --> 00:29:33.349
Minding a store.

447
00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:37.153
Raising a little lady.

448
00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:39.323
That was a good thing
your mama done.

449
00:29:41.157 --> 00:29:43.093
My father used to kill people?

450
00:29:43.927 --> 00:29:45.796
Yeah.

451
00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:47.432
But that was years ago.

452
00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:51.902
I haven't even seen
my father hold a gun.

453
00:29:51.935 --> 00:29:53.971
And that's because
he's a good man now.

454
00:29:55.406 --> 00:29:57.173
Because of what your mama done.

455
00:30:00.109 --> 00:30:01.711
You carry a gun.

456
00:30:02.813 --> 00:30:04.080
Are you a good man?

457
00:30:05.816 --> 00:30:07.084
I try to be.

458
00:30:08.219 --> 00:30:10.119
My mama's dead now.

459
00:30:13.891 --> 00:30:15.925
Is my father still a good man?

460
00:30:19.063 --> 00:30:23.267
[somber music playing]

461
00:30:34.244 --> 00:30:36.380
Would you like for me
to say a few words?

462
00:30:36.413 --> 00:30:38.816
You said plenty of words.

463
00:30:38.848 --> 00:30:40.084
None of them helped.

464
00:30:45.855 --> 00:30:47.424
There's something
you should know.

465
00:30:47.459 --> 00:30:51.828
Um, them fellas left
a mess in your barn.

466
00:30:53.565 --> 00:30:56.000
Not something your
little girl should see.

467
00:30:56.032 --> 00:31:01.005
You'll wanna clean that up
before you let her go in there.

468
00:31:01.038 --> 00:31:02.940
I reckon we'll be
hitting the trail.

469
00:31:02.972 --> 00:31:05.509
I figured we're only
a few hours behind 'em.

470
00:31:05.542 --> 00:31:08.546
And I think I've got a pretty
good idea where they're going.

471
00:31:08.579 --> 00:31:11.415
Tell me the names of
the men who did this.

472
00:31:11.449 --> 00:31:13.250
Tell me where they're going.

473
00:31:15.452 --> 00:31:16.554
No, sir.

474
00:31:16.587 --> 00:31:18.922
I don't think I can do that.

475
00:31:18.955 --> 00:31:22.527
I reckon it's been
a few years since the world

476
00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:24.429
has seen the old Colton Briggs

477
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:26.363
and I think the world
is probably pretty happy

478
00:31:26.396 --> 00:31:28.298
leaving that just
right where it is.

479
00:31:28.332 --> 00:31:29.900
Tell me the names of the men

480
00:31:29.932 --> 00:31:31.934
responsible for
the death of my wife.

481
00:31:31.969 --> 00:31:33.971
[Jarrett]
Briggs, listen to yourself.

482
00:31:34.003 --> 00:31:35.939
You see that
little girl over there?

483
00:31:35.972 --> 00:31:37.840
She just lost her mama.

484
00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:41.311
She needs her father now.

485
00:31:41.345 --> 00:31:44.481
Whatever changes happened to
you that that woman gave you,

486
00:31:44.516 --> 00:31:46.282
don't let 'em die with her.

487
00:31:46.317 --> 00:31:51.055
That little girl needs the man
that she knows and loves.

488
00:31:51.087 --> 00:31:54.491
You know, ever since
we were granted statehood,

489
00:31:54.526 --> 00:31:58.496
this here land is now
part of a new country.

490
00:31:58.529 --> 00:32:02.500
We got laws.
We got due process.

491
00:32:02.534 --> 00:32:05.403
Folks just don't go around
killin' other folks.

492
00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:08.372
That ain't the world anymore.

493
00:32:08.405 --> 00:32:10.074
Keep right by your daughter.

494
00:32:11.075 --> 00:32:13.210
Keep right by God.

495
00:32:13.242 --> 00:32:17.347
I will find those
murderous sons of bitches.

496
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:20.585
I will catch 'em.
We will take them to trial,

497
00:32:20.617 --> 00:32:22.185
and they will hang.

498
00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:23.587
I promise that to you.

499
00:32:25.221 --> 00:32:26.990
Take care of your daughter.

500
00:32:27.023 --> 00:32:29.594
As long as that
little girl is alive,

501
00:32:31.327 --> 00:32:34.064
there's no room for
vengeance in your life.

502
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:56.554
What do we do now?

503
00:32:56.587 --> 00:32:57.954
[Briggs] Go to bed.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.804
[Briggs] Get dressed.

519
00:35:59.836 --> 00:36:01.572
Those are pants.

520
00:36:01.606 --> 00:36:04.576
No dresses.
We leave in 15 minutes.

521
00:36:12.617 --> 00:36:13.885
[Brooke] This is Mama's horse.

522
00:36:13.918 --> 00:36:15.719
[Briggs] Yeah. They killed mine.

523
00:36:15.753 --> 00:36:18.422
We'll have to travel light.

524
00:36:18.456 --> 00:36:20.324
She can't run with both of us.

525
00:36:20.356 --> 00:36:21.702
If we're gonna catch up
with those men,

526
00:36:21.726 --> 00:36:23.360
we're gonna need another horse.

527
00:36:23.393 --> 00:36:25.195
Yeah. We'll find one
along the way.

[Brooke] This is a good time
for us to do this.

532
00:37:04.568 --> 00:37:06.436
My teacher at school is sick.

533
00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:08.371
If it's pox, she could
be sick for days.

534
00:37:08.405 --> 00:37:09.440
She could die.

535
00:37:09.474 --> 00:37:11.909
They'll get a new teacher.

536
00:37:11.943 --> 00:37:14.711
I forgot my school books.

537
00:37:14.746 --> 00:37:17.255
- I think they burned up in the fire.
- [Briggs] We'll get new books.

538
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.358
- [Brooke] What about my clothes?
- [Briggs] We'll get new clothes.

539
00:37:19.382 --> 00:37:20.728
[Brooke] Why did we
burn the old ones?

540
00:37:20.751 --> 00:37:22.251
Because we're not going back!

541
00:37:24.588 --> 00:37:26.289
We're not going back.

542
00:37:27.824 --> 00:37:29.726
As soon as I finish
what I have to do,

543
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.295
we'll find a new place and...

544
00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:33.831
we'll replace
everything you lost.

545
00:37:35.867 --> 00:37:37.266
Except Mama.

546
00:37:40.672 --> 00:37:42.873
[dramatic music playing]

547
00:37:52.617 --> 00:37:53.851
Give me the belt.

548
00:37:56.586 --> 00:37:57.722
You gonna whoop me?

549
00:38:11.436 --> 00:38:12.637
Take that.

550
00:38:14.038 --> 00:38:16.708
Over there by that tree,
off the path.

551
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.010
You can sleep for 30 minutes,
not longer.

552
00:38:19.043 --> 00:38:21.579
Then we'll eat,
and we'll get back on trail.

553
00:38:21.612 --> 00:38:24.246
We'll do that every four hours
until we catch 'em.

554
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.918
Aren't those men
getting further away?

555
00:38:26.951 --> 00:38:28.686
They're only men.
They need sleep as well.

556
00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:29.987
They'll wait for us.

557
00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:31.956
But if we keep going,
we can be there sooner,

558
00:38:31.989 --> 00:38:35.927
- before anything...
- Won't do us no good if we get there dead tired.

559
00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.730
Or if our horse
dies from exhaustion.

560
00:38:38.762 --> 00:38:41.398
It's not enough
that we find these men.

561
00:38:41.431 --> 00:38:44.001
We need to be ready to kill 'em.

562
00:38:44.034 --> 00:38:45.836
Because they'll be
meaning to kill us.

563
00:38:47.538 --> 00:38:48.706
[sighs]

564
00:38:51.708 --> 00:38:54.010
[foreboding music playing]

565
00:38:58.849 --> 00:39:04.856
[adventurous music playing]

566
00:39:04.889 --> 00:39:09.494
[horses neighing]

567
00:39:12.864 --> 00:39:14.664
Did that seem strange to you?

568
00:39:14.699 --> 00:39:16.298
That little girl last night?

569
00:39:17.601 --> 00:39:19.536
How do you mean?

570
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.938
Her mama had just been killed.

571
00:39:21.972 --> 00:39:24.842
She was sittin' there right
next to the body.

572
00:39:24.876 --> 00:39:26.476
Not a tear on her face.

573
00:39:28.612 --> 00:39:30.481
Hell, I never even
met the woman.

574
00:39:30.514 --> 00:39:34.585
I cried more about it
than her own daughter.

575
00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:36.987
Well, she's probably just
shocked from the news.

576
00:39:37.021 --> 00:39:39.556
I mean, her mama was just killed.
She ain't never coming back.

577
00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:42.927
Gotta be hard for any
youngster to understand.

578
00:39:44.628 --> 00:39:45.963
I suppose so.

579
00:39:47.565 --> 00:39:48.800
[gunshot]

580
00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:50.701
[horse neighs]

581
00:39:51.702 --> 00:39:53.637
Holy shit!

582
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.873
- [gun fires]
- [horses neigh]

583
00:39:55.907 --> 00:39:56.873
Come on. Come on. Come on.

584
00:39:56.907 --> 00:40:01.378
[gunshots continue]

585
00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:10.054
Holy shit, son.

586
00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:12.088
How'd you do that?

587
00:40:15.992 --> 00:40:16.992
[grunts]

588
00:40:19.096 --> 00:40:20.931
My leg is busted.

589
00:40:32.409 --> 00:40:34.445
That one's a shooter, shit.

590
00:40:34.478 --> 00:40:36.146
It's that marshal.

591
00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:37.681
You didn't shoot the marshal?

592
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.925
God damn it!

593
00:40:47.958 --> 00:40:50.170
That asshole started the ambush
before we're in position!

594
00:40:50.193 --> 00:40:52.929
[gunshots continue]

595
00:40:52.963 --> 00:40:54.898
[horse neighs]

596
00:40:58.768 --> 00:40:59.903
What do we do?

597
00:40:59.936 --> 00:41:01.706
Do you see Briggs?

598
00:41:01.739 --> 00:41:03.458
Shit, boss, I don't know
what he looks like.

599
00:41:04.876 --> 00:41:06.476
Oh, you'll know
when you see him.

600
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.677
I promise you that.

601
00:41:20.657 --> 00:41:22.693
Get down, Smiley!

602
00:41:22.726 --> 00:41:24.094
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

603
00:41:24.128 --> 00:41:25.695
Dumbass.

604
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.498
Let's see how far
them bastards get now.

605
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:32.637
Boss is pulling out.

606
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.106
Next reload,
let's get up that hill.

607
00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:37.108
[gunshots continue]

608
00:41:39.242 --> 00:41:40.777
I'm out of here!

609
00:41:44.148 --> 00:41:46.217
[gun cocking]

610
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.818
God help us.

611
00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:55.126
[twig snaps]

612
00:41:56.693 --> 00:41:57.929
[gasps]

613
00:42:02.532 --> 00:42:03.934
Is it time to leave?

614
00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:07.804
I heard gunshots coming
from across the canyon.

615
00:42:07.838 --> 00:42:10.007
- When?
- [Briggs] Ten minutes ago.

616
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:11.442
Why didn't you wake me?

617
00:42:12.677 --> 00:42:15.112
No reason to hurry.

618
00:42:15.146 --> 00:42:19.717
Gunshots might have a way of
speeding some folks up, but...

619
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.688
they have a nasty habit of
slowing other folks down.

620
00:42:28.059 --> 00:42:29.927
We'll find out what
happened soon enough.

621
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.994
Either way.

622
00:42:35.967 --> 00:42:37.134
[James] I can't believe you.

623
00:42:37.168 --> 00:42:39.036
[grunts]

624
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.505
You want to tell me what
the hell just happened? Huh?

625
00:42:41.539 --> 00:42:43.139
What the hell, boss?

626
00:42:43.173 --> 00:42:45.710
Those guys up front, they were
about to go behind the hill.

627
00:42:45.742 --> 00:42:47.210
I wouldn't have
seen 'em if I waited.

628
00:42:47.244 --> 00:42:50.880
You were supposed to shoot
the Marshal first. Huh?

629
00:42:50.914 --> 00:42:53.583
Instead, genius here decides to
shoot the first guy he sees,

630
00:42:53.617 --> 00:42:56.853
chasing everybody, including
the marshal, into cover.

631
00:42:56.887 --> 00:42:58.021
You know...

632
00:42:58.054 --> 00:42:59.757
I go to enormous pains

633
00:42:59.789 --> 00:43:01.791
to invite Colton Briggs
to come find me.

634
00:43:01.826 --> 00:43:04.795
You go ahead and leave a perfectly
healthy lawman between us.

635
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:06.831
It's like you're trying
to work against me.

636
00:43:08.766 --> 00:43:11.534
Is that what's
happening here? Huh?

637
00:43:11.568 --> 00:43:13.003
You're working against me?

638
00:43:17.208 --> 00:43:18.541
Nah, boss.

639
00:43:19.577 --> 00:43:21.545
I'm with you.

640
00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:23.681
I just messed up. That's all.

641
00:43:23.713 --> 00:43:26.583
I certainly hope so.

642
00:43:26.617 --> 00:43:28.052
Because if that
lawman stops Briggs

643
00:43:28.085 --> 00:43:29.186
before he can get to me...

644
00:43:30.887 --> 00:43:32.590
there will be hell to pay.

645
00:43:32.623 --> 00:43:34.090
Mm.

646
00:43:34.125 --> 00:43:35.893
[Eustice] It don't
matter for nothing.

647
00:43:38.362 --> 00:43:40.297
You got somethin' to say,
old man?

648
00:43:40.331 --> 00:43:42.932
If Colton Briggs
decides he's coming,

649
00:43:42.967 --> 00:43:45.168
you might as well set
an extra plate at the table

650
00:43:46.302 --> 00:43:48.072
because Colton Briggs is coming.

651
00:44:01.284 --> 00:44:02.952
What's going on?

652
00:44:02.987 --> 00:44:04.554
There's a rider coming.

653
00:44:05.722 --> 00:44:07.690
One of the men who killed Mama?

654
00:44:09.793 --> 00:44:11.829
Maybe one of the men
from the posse?

655
00:44:11.862 --> 00:44:14.297
Either way, we need his horse.

656
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:16.733
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm gonna take his horse.

657
00:44:16.766 --> 00:44:18.601
Chances are, he won't
like me doing that.

658
00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:20.380
I don't think Mama would
like you killin' no lawman.

659
00:44:20.405 --> 00:44:22.806
I don't know if he is a lawman.

660
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.275
Chances are he won't stop
and give me time to ask.

661
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:29.612
Can't you think of
another way to stop him?

662
00:44:42.827 --> 00:44:44.170
He'll be coming from
that direction.

663
00:44:44.195 --> 00:44:45.963
You stand there
and get him to stop.

664
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:47.931
How?

665
00:44:47.965 --> 00:44:50.367
Cry. Make him
feel sorry for you.

666
00:44:53.204 --> 00:44:54.905
I don't know how.

667
00:44:54.938 --> 00:44:56.273
[sighs]

668
00:44:59.175 --> 00:45:00.376
What did you just say?

669
00:45:02.947 --> 00:45:04.614
I don't know how to cry.

670
00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:09.686
Now, you listen to me.

671
00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:12.722
People in this world
expect you to act like they do.

672
00:45:12.755 --> 00:45:14.757
They expect you to laugh
at their jokes,

673
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:17.327
and sigh at their babies,
and cry at their funerals.

674
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.096
And if you can't learn
to do those things,

675
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.065
they won't accept you.
They'll push you out.

676
00:45:21.097 --> 00:45:23.032
Now, do you wanna
make it in this world?

677
00:45:23.067 --> 00:45:26.237
Answer me! Do you wanna fit in?

678
00:45:26.269 --> 00:45:28.550
Then you're going to have
figure out how to act like them.

679
00:45:30.273 --> 00:45:33.010
You remember last summer when
the parson's daughter died?

680
00:45:33.043 --> 00:45:34.844
You remember how his wife cried?

681
00:45:34.878 --> 00:45:36.380
Wahh wahh!

682
00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:38.349
Wahh wahh!

683
00:45:38.382 --> 00:45:39.849
A little louder. Wahh wahh!

684
00:45:39.884 --> 00:45:41.152
My baby! My baby!

685
00:45:41.184 --> 00:45:43.954
Wahh wahh! My baby! My baby!

686
00:45:45.155 --> 00:45:46.757
That'll have to do. Keep it up.

687
00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:55.065
Wahh wahh! Wahh wahh!

688
00:45:55.099 --> 00:45:57.034
Wahh wahh!

689
00:45:57.067 --> 00:45:58.335
You okay, little girl?

690
00:45:58.369 --> 00:46:01.137
Wahh! My baby! My baby!
Wahh!

691
00:46:01.172 --> 00:46:03.139
Baby? What baby?
What? What are you getting at?

692
00:46:03.173 --> 00:46:04.476
- Wahh!
- [gun cocks]

693
00:46:04.509 --> 00:46:06.143
You're gettin' off that horse.

694
00:46:08.012 --> 00:46:09.146
[horse snorts]

695
00:46:10.813 --> 00:46:12.054
You should have gone with Mark.

696
00:46:12.081 --> 00:46:14.885
[grunts] He looked pretty bad.

697
00:46:14.918 --> 00:46:18.054
And what? Leave you two
here without protection?

698
00:46:18.088 --> 00:46:20.123
I ain't helpless.

699
00:46:20.157 --> 00:46:22.793
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
It's me.

700
00:46:22.826 --> 00:46:24.295
Shit, Mark.

701
00:46:24.327 --> 00:46:26.963
You scared the hell out of us.

702
00:46:26.996 --> 00:46:28.500
What the hell are you
doing back here?

703
00:46:28.532 --> 00:46:29.967
Where's your horse?

704
00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:31.869
Ask them.

705
00:46:31.902 --> 00:46:33.771
- [gun cocks]
- What the hell?!

706
00:46:36.273 --> 00:46:37.340
[Mark] I'm sorry, guys.

707
00:46:39.476 --> 00:46:41.244
Now, Briggs,

708
00:46:41.277 --> 00:46:43.847
I know you're upset.
Hell, I don't blame you.

709
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.282
But whatever
you think you're doing,

710
00:46:45.315 --> 00:46:47.083
you need to let these boys go.

711
00:46:48.885 --> 00:46:50.753
Fetch that Rossi
and bring it here.

712
00:46:54.257 --> 00:46:56.260
My father wants your shotgun.

713
00:46:57.561 --> 00:46:59.195
Do what she says, Greg.

714
00:47:01.432 --> 00:47:05.034
I will blow this little girl's
brains all over this valley.

715
00:47:09.172 --> 00:47:10.373
Do you hear me?

716
00:47:12.943 --> 00:47:16.880
I said I will blow her brains
all over this valley.

717
00:47:16.914 --> 00:47:18.516
I'll pull the trigger right now!

718
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.351
[screams]

719
00:47:20.384 --> 00:47:22.885
[groans]

720
00:47:28.425 --> 00:47:30.360
[grunting]

721
00:47:30.393 --> 00:47:32.128
He cries pretty good.

722
00:47:32.929 --> 00:47:35.331
[grunts]

723
00:47:35.365 --> 00:47:37.434
I'm gonna try and do it
like him next time.

724
00:47:39.936 --> 00:47:42.039
Both of you put your hands
behind your back.

725
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.849
Is this enough wood?

726
00:47:51.882 --> 00:47:54.952
That wood's too green.
It needs to burn hotter.

727
00:47:54.985 --> 00:47:57.086
See the tip of that?

728
00:47:57.121 --> 00:47:59.123
Should burn so hot it glows red.

729
00:47:59.155 --> 00:48:00.224
Fetch dry wood.

730
00:48:00.257 --> 00:48:02.358
It burns hotter.
It burns faster.

731
00:48:13.438 --> 00:48:15.005
Listen to me, Briggs.

732
00:48:15.039 --> 00:48:16.507
Just listen to me.

733
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:20.077
Up till now, you haven't
committed any crimes

734
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.579
that you can't walk away from.

735
00:48:23.914 --> 00:48:26.182
I understand that you're
under a lot of pressure,

736
00:48:26.215 --> 00:48:28.284
pain of losing your wife.

737
00:48:28.318 --> 00:48:29.853
I can't imagine it.

738
00:48:29.887 --> 00:48:31.588
Any man might have done
the same thing.

739
00:48:31.623 --> 00:48:34.858
Made some of the same
decisions that you've made.

740
00:48:34.891 --> 00:48:36.360
But you are about to
cross a line

741
00:48:36.393 --> 00:48:38.228
that you can't get back from.

742
00:48:38.262 --> 00:48:41.465
Assaulting a US Marshal,

743
00:48:41.498 --> 00:48:43.400
murdering a US Marshal,

744
00:48:43.434 --> 00:48:46.936
that is trouble that you have
not encountered before.

745
00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:50.608
Are you sure about that?

746
00:48:55.978 --> 00:48:57.548
What about your daughter,
Briggs?

747
00:48:57.581 --> 00:49:00.485
You're making her an accessory.

748
00:49:00.518 --> 00:49:02.619
These men here need
medical attention

749
00:49:02.653 --> 00:49:04.297
and you are preventing
them from getting it.

750
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.657
No. You are.

751
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.992
By not telling me
what I want to know.

752
00:49:09.025 --> 00:49:10.427
I'm a federal marshal.

753
00:49:10.461 --> 00:49:12.429
You're asking me to
participate in murder.

754
00:49:12.463 --> 00:49:14.030
You're protecting a killer.

755
00:49:14.063 --> 00:49:15.365
From another killer.

756
00:49:17.967 --> 00:49:19.001
Correct.

757
00:49:25.543 --> 00:49:26.943
Is this dry enough?

758
00:49:26.976 --> 00:49:28.978
Good. Put it on the fire.

759
00:49:29.012 --> 00:49:30.514
We'll be ready to start soon.

760
00:49:33.518 --> 00:49:36.320
If anything happens to my men,
I swear to God,

761
00:49:36.353 --> 00:49:39.088
I will hunt you down
and I will kill you myself.

762
00:49:40.492 --> 00:49:42.626
[foreboding music playing]

763
00:49:44.961 --> 00:49:47.632
Like you hunted down the
man who killed my wife?

764
00:49:47.664 --> 00:49:49.932
The man who killed your men?

765
00:49:49.967 --> 00:49:53.336
The man responsible for
everything happening right now?

766
00:49:56.005 --> 00:49:57.641
I'll take my chances.

767
00:49:57.675 --> 00:49:58.675
Rip his shirt.

768
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:00.677
Don't you touch me!

769
00:50:00.711 --> 00:50:02.646
Give him the stick
like I showed you.

770
00:50:05.382 --> 00:50:07.552
- Please... stop... [screams]
- James McCallister!

771
00:50:10.755 --> 00:50:14.324
Name's James McCallister.
He rides with three men,

772
00:50:14.358 --> 00:50:17.695
Michael Orleans and Boots Miller
and Eustice Bedford.

773
00:50:17.728 --> 00:50:19.597
They're all hardened criminals.

774
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.998
Word is, he promised them
a share of a lockbox

775
00:50:22.032 --> 00:50:24.134
he's got stashed somewhere
if they'd bust him out of

776
00:50:24.168 --> 00:50:25.570
the prison in Powell County.

777
00:50:25.603 --> 00:50:27.472
And they're headed to Colorado.

778
00:50:27.505 --> 00:50:30.239
Somebody told me he's got a
little Mexican girl down there

779
00:50:30.273 --> 00:50:32.476
in a town he likes
called Santa Rosa.

780
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.112
The trail I was on meant that
he was headed that way.

781
00:50:35.144 --> 00:50:38.014
And that's all I know
about it. I swear it.

782
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:40.751
Hold him.

783
00:50:40.784 --> 00:50:43.119
- No, no.
- Oh, you son of a bitch!

784
00:50:43.152 --> 00:50:45.722
- [screams]
- I will kill you, you son of a bitch!

785
00:50:45.757 --> 00:50:47.224
[screams]

786
00:50:50.561 --> 00:50:52.630
[bullet clangs]

787
00:50:52.664 --> 00:50:54.097
Bring me the iron.

788
00:50:58.536 --> 00:51:02.440
Pinch the flesh on each side of
the wound and push it together.

789
00:51:02.474 --> 00:51:05.074
We have to burn it with the iron

790
00:51:05.108 --> 00:51:06.777
or he'll bleed out soon.

791
00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:08.378
[flesh searing]

792
00:51:11.148 --> 00:51:12.717
Smells like Mama's rabbit chops.

793
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:15.018
Mm, that's the whiskey.

794
00:51:17.822 --> 00:51:19.289
Makes me hungry.

795
00:51:19.322 --> 00:51:20.356
Mm-hmm.

796
00:51:22.659 --> 00:51:23.659
[bullet clattering]

797
00:51:25.762 --> 00:51:27.331
The bullet was poisoning him.

798
00:51:27.364 --> 00:51:29.501
He's got a chance now.

799
00:51:29.534 --> 00:51:32.335
But these men are not
walking out of this canyon.

800
00:51:34.806 --> 00:51:37.039
If get to Santa Rosa...

801
00:51:37.074 --> 00:51:39.777
and there's
no James McCallister,

802
00:51:39.811 --> 00:51:42.447
no Mexican girl,
no gang of four,

803
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.748
I will come back here
and I will kill these two men

804
00:51:44.782 --> 00:51:48.050
before you can return with help.

805
00:51:48.085 --> 00:51:50.253
And then, I will wait for you.

806
00:51:50.286 --> 00:51:52.657
And no matter how many men
you bring back with you,

807
00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:54.224
I will kill you first.

808
00:51:54.257 --> 00:51:56.494
I will kill you...

809
00:51:56.527 --> 00:51:58.530
before you even see me.

810
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.532
Do you understand?

811
00:52:04.501 --> 00:52:07.639
We're taking your guns
and your horse.

812
00:52:07.672 --> 00:52:09.507
You gotta leave me
a horse, Briggs!

813
00:52:09.541 --> 00:52:12.744
- You can't take my horse!
- Take your mother's horse.

814
00:52:12.777 --> 00:52:15.512
- This one suits me fine.
- Damn it, don't question me.

815
00:52:15.547 --> 00:52:17.356
You've got more experience
with your mother's horse.

816
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.750
She knows you.
Fewer surprises.

817
00:52:18.782 --> 00:52:19.784
Now get up.

818
00:52:19.817 --> 00:52:21.284
[horse snorts]

819
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:33.831
[somber music]

820
00:52:43.172 --> 00:52:45.742
I'll leave your horse
tied up in Santa Rosa.

821
00:52:45.777 --> 00:52:47.244
I'm no horse thief.

822
00:52:47.277 --> 00:52:50.246
Justice is gonna
find you, Briggs.

823
00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.217
- H'yah!
- You hear me? God damn you.

824
00:52:54.251 --> 00:52:56.320
Justice will catch you!

825
00:53:33.222 --> 00:53:34.291
[James] There.

826
00:53:34.324 --> 00:53:35.860
Just like I told you boys.

827
00:53:35.893 --> 00:53:37.929
[Eustice] Let's crack her open
and see what we got.

828
00:53:37.961 --> 00:53:40.297
[creaking]

829
00:53:41.632 --> 00:53:42.934
Oh, lordy.

830
00:53:42.967 --> 00:53:45.436
[laughing] Whoo-hoo!

831
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.244
<i>"El Banco Londres Y Mexico"?</i>

832
00:53:54.277 --> 00:53:55.713
What the hell?

833
00:53:55.746 --> 00:53:56.880
Now settle down.

834
00:53:57.949 --> 00:53:59.416
What the hell, boss?

835
00:53:59.449 --> 00:54:01.518
Where's the money, boss?

836
00:54:01.552 --> 00:54:04.856
Now, if I was crossing you,

837
00:54:04.889 --> 00:54:06.289
I would have killed you already.

838
00:54:06.322 --> 00:54:07.858
But I didn't.

839
00:54:09.994 --> 00:54:12.429
Nothing but a dirty rat...

840
00:54:13.498 --> 00:54:14.766
[grumbles]

841
00:54:14.798 --> 00:54:16.567
You ain't too bright now,
is you?

842
00:54:16.601 --> 00:54:18.268
But that's okay.
That's why you got me.

843
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.804
I got brains.

844
00:54:19.836 --> 00:54:22.472
And my brains know that since
we busted out of jail,

845
00:54:22.507 --> 00:54:23.884
we're gonna have to
lay low for a while.

846
00:54:23.907 --> 00:54:25.909
At least a year or so.

847
00:54:25.943 --> 00:54:27.878
Any of you boys got any idea
what kind of money

848
00:54:27.911 --> 00:54:29.914
they spend down in Mexico? Hm?

849
00:54:30.947 --> 00:54:32.617
Right there,

850
00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:33.960
that's enough <i>dinero</i>
for each of us

851
00:54:33.985 --> 00:54:36.487
to live like kings
for as long as we need.

852
00:54:36.521 --> 00:54:38.623
Each of you get an equal share,

853
00:54:38.655 --> 00:54:41.324
hm, as long as
you stick with me.

854
00:54:41.358 --> 00:54:44.929
Or, we can split it up here
and part ways as friends.

855
00:54:44.961 --> 00:54:46.463
But I will tell you this.

856
00:54:46.496 --> 00:54:48.231
That money...

857
00:54:48.264 --> 00:54:51.902
well, ain't worth a nickel
this side of the border.

858
00:54:51.936 --> 00:54:53.871
Not unless you know
where to spend it.

859
00:54:53.905 --> 00:54:54.972
And boys...

860
00:54:56.338 --> 00:54:57.340
I do.

861
00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.746
What about this Briggs fella?

862
00:55:01.778 --> 00:55:03.023
Yeah, we're gonna have to
figure that out

863
00:55:03.047 --> 00:55:04.481
and figure it out fast.

864
00:55:04.514 --> 00:55:05.782
It's all part of the plan.

865
00:55:05.817 --> 00:55:07.518
Should we wait for him
and set a ambush

866
00:55:07.552 --> 00:55:09.251
like we did for the marshal?

867
00:55:09.286 --> 00:55:11.588
We don't know how far
behind us Briggs might be.

868
00:55:11.621 --> 00:55:14.291
We could be sittin'
in the bush for days.

869
00:55:14.324 --> 00:55:16.460
And two, Briggs
ain't the type of man

870
00:55:16.494 --> 00:55:18.496
to walk into
an ambush unprepared.

871
00:55:19.664 --> 00:55:20.965
Then how do we hunt him down?

872
00:55:20.998 --> 00:55:24.001
I thought I made myself clear.

873
00:55:24.034 --> 00:55:25.869
We ain't huntin' nobody.

874
00:55:27.804 --> 00:55:29.740
Briggs is huntin' us.

875
00:55:29.773 --> 00:55:31.442
[chuckles]

876
00:55:31.476 --> 00:55:38.380
[ominous music playing]

877
00:55:40.585 --> 00:55:42.351
[horses snort]

878
00:55:50.594 --> 00:55:51.963
What do we need that for?

879
00:55:51.996 --> 00:55:53.431
It's good firewood.

880
00:55:56.365 --> 00:55:57.869
That was on someone's grave.

881
00:55:57.902 --> 00:55:58.902
So?

882
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:02.539
It belongs to someone.

883
00:56:05.443 --> 00:56:07.811
Nothing belongs to the dead...

884
00:56:07.844 --> 00:56:09.847
because the dead
don't need anything.

885
00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.849
Only the living
need to possess things.

886
00:56:12.884 --> 00:56:16.318
The living need food,
water, shelter,

887
00:56:16.353 --> 00:56:21.458
clothes, family,
money, and land.

888
00:56:21.492 --> 00:56:25.429
But the dead, the dead've
already been tended to.

889
00:56:25.463 --> 00:56:27.764
Once they're put in the ground,

890
00:56:27.798 --> 00:56:29.500
they have all they need.

891
00:56:29.534 --> 00:56:30.967
They're not selfish.

892
00:56:32.103 --> 00:56:34.405
I like the dead.

893
00:56:34.438 --> 00:56:36.338
[acoustic guitar music playing]

894
00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.387
[horses snort]

895
00:56:58.728 --> 00:57:00.530
[Eustice] I don't like this.

896
00:57:00.565 --> 00:57:01.833
There's a sheriff.

897
00:57:01.865 --> 00:57:03.701
Well, the sheriff's in Denver.

898
00:57:03.733 --> 00:57:05.101
Two days away.

899
00:57:05.135 --> 00:57:07.369
We cut the telegraph lines
coming into town,

900
00:57:07.405 --> 00:57:08.981
which means it'll be
upwards of four days

901
00:57:09.005 --> 00:57:10.818
before any sheriff can get
the news that we're here

902
00:57:10.842 --> 00:57:12.610
and show up to do
anything about it.

903
00:57:12.643 --> 00:57:14.644
That office is where
they keep the bad folks

904
00:57:14.679 --> 00:57:16.847
until the lawman
can come pick 'em up.

905
00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.583
[horses whinny]

906
00:57:20.518 --> 00:57:21.552
[Eustice] Still...

907
00:57:21.585 --> 00:57:23.688
feelin' mighty exposed

908
00:57:23.721 --> 00:57:25.088
ridin' into town like this.

909
00:57:25.121 --> 00:57:26.824
You gonna question
my every call?

910
00:57:29.059 --> 00:57:31.027
Now, I need you boys
to set a guard

911
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:32.394
at the edge of town, all right?

912
00:57:32.429 --> 00:57:34.798
Anyone rides in,
you let me know.

913
00:57:34.831 --> 00:57:36.900
And rotate every couple hours.

914
00:57:36.934 --> 00:57:38.635
Y'all look like dog shit.

915
00:57:38.668 --> 00:57:40.112
I need you rested for
when Briggs gets here

916
00:57:40.137 --> 00:57:41.505
or you're of no use to me.

917
00:57:41.539 --> 00:57:44.141
Understand?

918
00:57:44.175 --> 00:57:47.445
And ladies,
I assume you're well rested.

919
00:57:47.478 --> 00:57:50.014
I am in need of your services.

920
00:57:50.047 --> 00:57:52.148
You heard him.
Who wants first watch?

921
00:57:55.552 --> 00:57:57.420
Well, I'll take first watch.

922
00:57:57.454 --> 00:57:59.724
But you better come
and relieve me in four hours.

923
00:58:02.893 --> 00:58:04.773
[Big Mike] You want to
give me a hand with this?

924
00:58:04.862 --> 00:58:06.396
[grunts]

925
00:58:07.831 --> 00:58:12.168
[foreboding music]

926
00:58:17.041 --> 00:58:19.476
That marshal said
you used to kill people.

927
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.811
That marshal should
guard his words

928
00:58:21.846 --> 00:58:23.547
when speaking to children.

929
00:58:26.684 --> 00:58:28.518
[sighs]

930
00:58:28.552 --> 00:58:29.786
Is it true?

931
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.887
Yes.

932
00:58:37.728 --> 00:58:39.063
He said you gave it up.

933
00:58:41.032 --> 00:58:42.766
He said you gave it up for Mama.

934
00:58:47.237 --> 00:58:48.639
Is that true?

935
00:58:57.648 --> 00:58:59.516
He said Mama changed you.

936
00:59:03.753 --> 00:59:05.489
My entire life...

937
00:59:06.523 --> 00:59:08.793
even as a boy, I knew.

938
00:59:10.126 --> 00:59:11.762
I knew I was different.

939
00:59:14.931 --> 00:59:18.702
My mother always said
I didn't cry as a baby.

940
00:59:18.735 --> 00:59:20.036
I didn't laugh.

941
00:59:22.005 --> 00:59:24.240
When my mother died,
I was very young,

942
00:59:24.275 --> 00:59:26.677
but I didn't shed a tear
at her funeral.

943
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:29.914
Lots of folks did, but I didn't.

944
00:59:29.947 --> 00:59:32.182
Growing up, the other kids
would play games

945
00:59:32.215 --> 00:59:33.583
and joke with each other,

946
00:59:33.617 --> 00:59:35.552
and they would cry...

947
00:59:35.585 --> 00:59:38.222
if they got hurt
or if they were scared.

948
00:59:38.255 --> 00:59:39.956
And I'd watch 'em.

949
00:59:41.057 --> 00:59:43.027
I got pretty good at pretending.

950
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:47.731
Good enough, anyway.

951
00:59:47.764 --> 00:59:50.701
Pretending I was like
the other kids.

952
00:59:51.702 --> 00:59:53.570
Pretending I was...

953
00:59:54.704 --> 00:59:55.905
normal.

954
00:59:57.742 --> 01:00:01.545
That's when I realized
I had never known fear.

955
01:00:03.047 --> 01:00:05.115
My whole life, I'd seen fear

956
01:00:05.148 --> 01:00:07.751
in the eyes of
every man I ever met.

957
01:00:07.784 --> 01:00:09.753
I've come to expect it.

958
01:00:09.786 --> 01:00:13.190
Grown men, terrified when
they had no reason to be.

959
01:00:17.795 --> 01:00:20.030
I remember this one man
who was looking for me

960
01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:22.032
because I had shot
a couple of his friends.

961
01:00:23.733 --> 01:00:26.302
He caught up with me
in a bathhouse.

962
01:00:26.336 --> 01:00:29.672
My pistol's lying out of reach,
next to my clothes.

963
01:00:29.706 --> 01:00:33.344
And I remember seeing
this man holding a gun

964
01:00:33.376 --> 01:00:36.179
on a cold, naked man
sitting in a tub,

965
01:00:36.213 --> 01:00:38.148
and yet, he was the one shaking.

966
01:00:38.181 --> 01:00:40.083
[scoffs] Too scared to move.

967
01:00:42.887 --> 01:00:46.190
So, I stood up from my bath,

968
01:00:46.222 --> 01:00:50.193
and I quietly
walked over to the man

969
01:00:50.226 --> 01:00:52.195
and I took his pistol away.

970
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.101
And then I shot him
dead with it.

971
01:01:00.304 --> 01:01:02.273
He didn't even beg for his life.

972
01:01:08.846 --> 01:01:12.382
And even though I could
recognize fear in men,

973
01:01:12.416 --> 01:01:16.186
even to a point where I could
use it against them,

974
01:01:16.219 --> 01:01:20.090
I can honestly say I had no
idea what it actually felt like.

975
01:01:22.293 --> 01:01:23.860
It was as if...

976
01:01:25.728 --> 01:01:27.197
I'd been born...

977
01:01:28.331 --> 01:01:29.934
dead inside.

978
01:01:32.103 --> 01:01:33.771
But I didn't care.

979
01:01:35.139 --> 01:01:36.706
'Cause I was dead inside.

980
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:41.811
[Briggs sips, sighs]

981
01:01:50.353 --> 01:01:52.123
How did Mama change that?

982
01:01:54.992 --> 01:01:58.362
When I met your mother,
there was no introduction.

983
01:01:58.394 --> 01:02:00.664
There was no getting
to know each other.

984
01:02:02.467 --> 01:02:05.369
And in that first moment,
I saw her.

985
01:02:08.405 --> 01:02:09.974
I felt something.

986
01:02:12.976 --> 01:02:14.811
Something I'd never felt before.

987
01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.380
Love?

988
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:22.887
Fear.

989
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.356
Fear she wouldn't talk to me.
Fear she wouldn't love me.

990
01:02:28.224 --> 01:02:30.226
Fear I couldn't
make her my wife.

991
01:02:31.228 --> 01:02:33.329
[sobs]

992
01:02:34.465 --> 01:02:36.733
Fear of losing her.

993
01:02:43.106 --> 01:02:46.076
She was the only thing
I ever feared...

994
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.389
and the only thing I ever loved.

995
01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:56.954
[somber music]

996
01:03:01.257 --> 01:03:04.260
When they told me Mama was dead,
I didn't know how to feel.

997
01:03:04.295 --> 01:03:06.262
She was your mother.

998
01:03:06.297 --> 01:03:09.199
You feel sad. You feel loss.

999
01:03:10.434 --> 01:03:12.101
Is that how you felt?

1000
01:03:13.304 --> 01:03:14.804
I felt pain.

1001
01:03:17.074 --> 01:03:19.210
Like a part of me
was killed with her.

1002
01:03:21.778 --> 01:03:23.380
Do you still feel like that?

1003
01:03:28.985 --> 01:03:32.021
When Mama died,
I didn't feel anything.

1004
01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:39.096
It was as if I died.

1005
01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:46.027
[whispering] Like I was lost.

1006
01:03:47.838 --> 01:03:51.074
I was lying in my bed,
in my room...

1007
01:03:53.844 --> 01:03:55.278
in our house.

1008
01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:02.286
But it felt like I would
never find my way back

1009
01:04:02.318 --> 01:04:03.420
to those things again.

1010
01:04:05.054 --> 01:04:06.289
You will.

1011
01:04:19.003 --> 01:04:20.572
Do you know the man
who killed Mama?

1012
01:04:20.605 --> 01:04:23.306
The man the marshal
told us about?

1013
01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:26.909
James McCallister?

1014
01:04:31.114 --> 01:04:33.983
Tomorrow,
after the sun comes up...

1015
01:04:36.987 --> 01:04:38.289
can you teach me how to shoot?

1016
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:45.461
Good.

1017
01:04:48.164 --> 01:04:49.501
I think I'd like that.

1018
01:04:51.168 --> 01:04:57.974
[dramatic music]

1019
01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.253
Oh! Son of a bitch.

1020
01:05:09.286 --> 01:05:12.222
Oh. Oh, damn it.

1021
01:05:12.255 --> 01:05:14.992
Now remember,
keep your left eye closed.

1022
01:05:15.025 --> 01:05:18.530
Let the barrel drift
right above your target.

1023
01:05:18.563 --> 01:05:21.931
When you're ready,
gently breathe

1024
01:05:21.965 --> 01:05:25.302
all the air out of your lungs
and let the barrel fall.

1025
01:05:25.335 --> 01:05:30.007
Time it so your breath ends
just as you line up your shot.

1026
01:05:30.039 --> 01:05:31.375
At the bottom of your breath,

1027
01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:33.943
squeeze the trigger, don't pull,

1028
01:05:33.976 --> 01:05:35.556
- Squeeze with your whole hand.
- [gun shot]

1029
01:05:35.579 --> 01:05:37.146
[Brooke gasps]

1030
01:05:45.422 --> 01:05:47.157
Were you aiming for the hat?

1031
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:48.492
Just below it.

1032
01:05:48.525 --> 01:05:50.494
I was aiming for his chest.

1033
01:05:50.527 --> 01:05:52.896
You pulled. You didn't squeeze.

1034
01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.601
Let's try it again.

1035
01:06:03.106 --> 01:06:05.543
- [sighs]
- What's wrong?

1036
01:06:07.378 --> 01:06:08.911
Can I try the pistol?

1037
01:06:10.581 --> 01:06:12.516
[Briggs] H'yah! Hit!

1038
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.485
[jaunty music playing]

1039
01:06:14.518 --> 01:06:16.286
Remember to squeeze.

1040
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.353
Don't pull.

1041
01:06:23.695 --> 01:06:27.364
[sweeping music]

1042
01:06:40.677 --> 01:06:42.547
Morning, Eustice.

1043
01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:46.016
Those turkey bungholes never
relieved me of duty last night.

1044
01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:48.184
Left me sittin' out there
all night!

1045
01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:49.318
Is that so?

1046
01:06:50.454 --> 01:06:53.190
Boys? Come on down.

1047
01:06:53.222 --> 01:06:54.458
What is it, boss?

1048
01:06:54.492 --> 01:06:56.527
Eustice here has a grievance

1049
01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:58.596
he would like to air with
the rest of the gang.

1050
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:01.398
- Go ahead.
- [Eustice] You two!

1051
01:07:01.432 --> 01:07:04.402
You were supposed to relieve me
in my post after four hours.

1052
01:07:04.436 --> 01:07:06.471
And that didn't happen.

1053
01:07:06.503 --> 01:07:08.105
And that's bullshit!

1054
01:07:08.137 --> 01:07:10.072
Eustice, please accept
my sincerest apologies

1055
01:07:10.106 --> 01:07:11.509
on behalf of
the rest of the gang.

1056
01:07:11.543 --> 01:07:15.045
We sure are sorry,
ain't we, boys?

1057
01:07:15.077 --> 01:07:16.681
And why didn't you
just come get us?

1058
01:07:18.047 --> 01:07:19.248
What?

1059
01:07:19.282 --> 01:07:21.652
If we were supposed to
relieve you,

1060
01:07:21.686 --> 01:07:24.021
why didn't you just come get
one of us to take your place?

1061
01:07:24.054 --> 01:07:26.322
Eustice? Why didn't you just
come get one of the boys?

1062
01:07:26.356 --> 01:07:30.527
Well, I... I didn't want to
leave my post, you know?

1063
01:07:30.561 --> 01:07:32.496
Briggs is a dangerous man.

1064
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:35.231
And if he would've seen
there was no guard,

1065
01:07:35.264 --> 01:07:37.067
he might have snuck
in here and got us.

1066
01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:39.670
You didn't...
fall asleep, did you?

1067
01:07:39.704 --> 01:07:42.239
[suspenseful music]

1068
01:07:42.271 --> 01:07:43.474
No, boss.

1069
01:07:43.507 --> 01:07:46.411
Eustice...

1070
01:07:46.443 --> 01:07:48.244
you wouldn't be lying to me,
would you?

1071
01:07:48.277 --> 01:07:51.047
No, boss. I mean,
I... I might've...

1072
01:07:51.081 --> 01:07:53.317
I might've shut my eyes
for a second or two as I...

1073
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:54.585
You know, was so tired.

1074
01:07:54.619 --> 01:07:56.161
It was... it was a
long ride and I... I...

1075
01:07:56.186 --> 01:07:57.186
Eustice, shh.

1076
01:07:59.724 --> 01:08:01.023
Oh.

1077
01:08:03.126 --> 01:08:07.331
Falling asleep on guard duty
is a terrible thing to do.

1078
01:08:07.364 --> 01:08:09.534
What if Briggs had shown up
and you'd been asleep?

1079
01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:11.603
[Big Mike] Yeah. Yeah,

1080
01:08:11.635 --> 01:08:13.737
he might have snuck in and
got us, like you said.

1081
01:08:13.771 --> 01:08:15.606
No. I would have seen him.

1082
01:08:15.639 --> 01:08:18.375
- [bones crack]
- [screams]

1083
01:08:18.408 --> 01:08:20.511
- [James shushes]
- [whimpers]

1084
01:08:20.545 --> 01:08:23.814
Now, I did you a favor.
All right?

1085
01:08:23.847 --> 01:08:26.650
Next time you're on watch,
you get a little sleepy,

1086
01:08:26.684 --> 01:08:29.420
you just give that
broken finger a squeeze,

1087
01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:31.121
and you'll perk right back up.

1088
01:08:37.595 --> 01:08:39.061
[Brooke] What's wrong?

1089
01:08:39.095 --> 01:08:42.198
There's only one way into town.

1090
01:08:42.231 --> 01:08:44.134
If they're down there,

1091
01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:45.806
they'll be watching
everyone who comes in.

1092
01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:52.443
They left a message in the barn.

1093
01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:53.845
It felt familiar.

1094
01:08:53.877 --> 01:08:56.179
Like it was meant for me.

1095
01:08:57.782 --> 01:08:59.382
What'd it say?

1096
01:09:03.386 --> 01:09:06.623
I don't like walking in, not
knowing who I'm looking for.

1097
01:09:06.658 --> 01:09:09.192
If they know me,
it'll give them the edge.

1098
01:09:09.225 --> 01:09:10.728
They'll see me coming.

1099
01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:12.328
I won't see them.

1100
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:16.265
Do you think they'll know me?

1101
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.443
[Briggs] <i>Now you</i>
<i>ride into town casually.</i>

1102
01:09:25.475 --> 01:09:28.746
<i>You've been sent on an errand
from your parents' farm up the road.</i>

1103
01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:31.180
<i>Keep your head up,
and look at everyone carefully.</i>

1104
01:09:44.429 --> 01:09:46.863
<i>Head straight for
the mercantile.</i>

1105
01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:50.568
<i>Go inside and ask the man
to buy something.</i>

1106
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:54.439
<i>And then casually ask if any
riders had come through town.</i>

1107
01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:59.510
<i>Whatever he tells you,
you bring that information</i>

1108
01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:01.479
<i>straight back to me.</i>

1109
01:10:06.751 --> 01:10:07.831
Can I help you, young lady?

1110
01:10:10.287 --> 01:10:11.287
Young lady?

1111
01:10:14.859 --> 01:10:17.293
Pardon my manners.
You must have caught me daydreaming.

1112
01:10:17.327 --> 01:10:19.930
I almost forgot
why I came in here.

1113
01:10:19.963 --> 01:10:21.565
My mama got it in
her head yesterday

1114
01:10:21.599 --> 01:10:22.833
that she had to bake a cake

1115
01:10:22.867 --> 01:10:24.601
for the church potluck
this weekend.

1116
01:10:24.636 --> 01:10:26.837
Last year, she made a pie,
but the apples that she used

1117
01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:28.405
grew on Mr. Johnson's
apple tree,

1118
01:10:28.439 --> 01:10:30.207
the one back by his outhouse.

1119
01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:31.442
And wouldn't you know it,

1120
01:10:31.475 --> 01:10:33.176
those apples tasted
plum like shit

1121
01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:35.378
and made anyone who ate
them sick to their gut.

1122
01:10:35.412 --> 01:10:37.515
I tell ya', I think that
shit in that outhouse

1123
01:10:37.547 --> 01:10:38.783
soaked down into the roots

1124
01:10:38.815 --> 01:10:40.359
and changed the way
a basic apple can taste.

1125
01:10:40.384 --> 01:10:42.886
But Mr. Johnson says
that's a bunch of hooey,

1126
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.622
and because of that,
he won't let Mama

1127
01:10:44.655 --> 01:10:46.390
have any more apples
for her apple pie,

1128
01:10:46.423 --> 01:10:48.693
which, as far as I'm concerned,
is fine by me and Mama

1129
01:10:48.725 --> 01:10:49.936
because like I mentioned before,

1130
01:10:49.961 --> 01:10:51.929
those apples
taste like shit anyhow.

1131
01:10:53.329 --> 01:10:54.599
Who the hell is Mr. Johnson?

1132
01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.342
[Big Mike] Is this
the little girl you seen, Boots?

1133
01:11:07.912 --> 01:11:10.782
It is the little girl we
saw the other morning.

1134
01:11:10.814 --> 01:11:13.618
Hello there, little miss.

1135
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:15.787
That's a fine horse
you're riding.

1136
01:11:15.819 --> 01:11:19.423
Couldn't help
but notice the saddle.

1137
01:11:19.457 --> 01:11:21.457
Wouldn't mind telling me
how you got it, would you?

1138
01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.429
Better yet...

1139
01:11:24.462 --> 01:11:26.596
Why don't you just tell me
where your daddy is?

1140
01:11:26.631 --> 01:11:28.932
[tense music playing]

1141
01:11:33.938 --> 01:11:37.742
Maria, this here is
my little sister.

1142
01:11:37.774 --> 01:11:40.377
<i>- Buenos dias.</i>
- [chuckles]

1143
01:11:43.914 --> 01:11:45.416
[Boots] Still no sign of him.

1144
01:11:45.449 --> 01:11:47.585
[James] Hm.

1145
01:11:47.618 --> 01:11:49.029
He'll be around soon enough,
I 'spect.

1146
01:11:49.052 --> 01:11:50.887
This one hasn't
touched her food.

1147
01:11:50.921 --> 01:11:52.989
I 'spect she's
too scared to eat.

1148
01:11:53.024 --> 01:11:54.859
Is that it, little sister?

1149
01:11:54.891 --> 01:11:56.259
You too scared to eat?

1150
01:11:56.894 --> 01:11:57.929
No.

1151
01:12:00.396 --> 01:12:01.698
[James]
Of course not.

1152
01:12:01.733 --> 01:12:03.042
'Spect the daughter
of Colton Briggs

1153
01:12:03.067 --> 01:12:04.333
ain't scared of nothin'.

1154
01:12:10.707 --> 01:12:12.710
You boys hang that sign
outside like I asked?

1155
01:12:12.743 --> 01:12:15.046
Red paint. Just like you asked.

1156
01:12:15.078 --> 01:12:17.047
Good. Where's Big Mike?

1157
01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:19.381
He's got a good angle
at the road into town.

1158
01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:21.452
Ah, well.

1159
01:12:21.485 --> 01:12:23.520
One of you set up
at the other end of town.

1160
01:12:23.554 --> 01:12:25.489
- The other across the street.
- Yes, sir.

1161
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:28.725
Oh, and, boys...

1162
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.595
Stay out of sight, all right?

1163
01:12:30.627 --> 01:12:32.038
It's important he gets to
the middle of town

1164
01:12:32.063 --> 01:12:33.698
and sees our invitation

1165
01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:35.766
before we throw him his
little surprise party.

1166
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.836
Boss, if we get a chance to put
a bullet in Colton Briggs,

1167
01:12:38.869 --> 01:12:40.671
we oughta do it.

1168
01:12:40.704 --> 01:12:43.305
It ain't smart playing games
with a fella like that.

1169
01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.510
Sounds like he's
the one who's scared.

1170
01:12:45.542 --> 01:12:46.978
[chuckles]

1171
01:12:48.679 --> 01:12:50.547
Sure does, doesn't it?

1172
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:54.551
You hear what little
sister just said?

1173
01:12:55.418 --> 01:12:56.587
You scared?

1174
01:12:56.621 --> 01:12:58.555
I'll take the other end of town.

1175
01:13:00.123 --> 01:13:01.893
[doors swing]

1176
01:13:04.628 --> 01:13:06.395
[horses neigh]

1177
01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:12.737
[Eustice] Boss is
expecting Briggs anytime.

1178
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:15.605
Might wanna wake your ass up.

1179
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.011
- I'm awake.
- [Eustice] Good. Keep it that way.

1180
01:13:20.043 --> 01:13:23.014
We're supposed to let him get
into town before we kill him.

1181
01:13:23.046 --> 01:13:25.347
He wants him to see that we got
his daughter or something.

1182
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:27.417
- Makes sense.
- [gun cocks]

1183
01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:29.020
You do yourself and
all of us a favor.

1184
01:13:29.052 --> 01:13:31.354
You see that son of a bitch,

1185
01:13:31.387 --> 01:13:32.523
you put a bullet in him.

1186
01:13:34.926 --> 01:13:35.926
H'yah!

1187
01:13:40.698 --> 01:13:41.932
Go back right there.

1188
01:13:48.805 --> 01:13:50.474
If you ain't too scared to eat,

1189
01:13:50.507 --> 01:13:51.819
why ain't you
touched your food yet?

1190
01:13:51.842 --> 01:13:53.109
It's probably poison.

1191
01:13:53.144 --> 01:13:54.744
So you is scared.

1192
01:13:55.846 --> 01:13:57.515
Scared of poison.

1193
01:13:57.547 --> 01:13:59.649
You don't have to be scared
to not eat poison.

1194
01:14:00.551 --> 01:14:01.918
Just not stupid.

1195
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:06.590
[James] You see this?

1196
01:14:11.828 --> 01:14:13.730
No poison.

1197
01:14:13.764 --> 01:14:16.434
I couldn't poison you
even if I wanted to.

1198
01:14:16.466 --> 01:14:19.670
Reckon it's some kind of
sin to poison your kin.

1199
01:14:22.539 --> 01:14:23.740
Stop saying that.

1200
01:14:24.876 --> 01:14:26.510
Stop sayin' what?

1201
01:14:26.543 --> 01:14:28.945
Stop calling me your sister.

1202
01:14:28.979 --> 01:14:30.514
We ain't kin.

1203
01:14:30.547 --> 01:14:31.925
[James] You and I are
most certainly kin

1204
01:14:31.948 --> 01:14:33.551
in almost all respects.

1205
01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:36.820
The uh... fruits of
your father's labors.

1206
01:14:36.854 --> 01:14:41.458
[chuckles] Sure as shootin'.

1207
01:14:41.492 --> 01:14:43.461
- You're a liar.
- [James] I'm not saying that

1208
01:14:43.493 --> 01:14:46.096
your daddy knocked my mama up
and they made a baby.

1209
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:48.164
No, no, no.

1210
01:14:48.198 --> 01:14:50.610
There was another man who had
the honors of my physical birth.

1211
01:14:50.635 --> 01:14:54.505
But he's not around no more...

1212
01:14:54.537 --> 01:14:57.440
on account of the day
I like to call my...

1213
01:14:57.475 --> 01:14:59.609
"spiritual birth."

1214
01:14:59.644 --> 01:15:03.447
You see, it was on that day
that your daddy...

1215
01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.815
he decided I didn't
need mine anymore.

1216
01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:07.717
He took him away from me.

1217
01:15:07.752 --> 01:15:08.985
Right there in front of me.

1218
01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:12.890
I watched him die.

1219
01:15:12.923 --> 01:15:14.891
Watched the life leave his eyes.

1220
01:15:17.494 --> 01:15:19.072
It was right then that
I stared into the eyes

1221
01:15:19.095 --> 01:15:20.136
of the man who killed him.

1222
01:15:21.698 --> 01:15:23.167
And you know what
your daddy did?

1223
01:15:25.836 --> 01:15:27.171
He stared right back at me.

1224
01:15:30.975 --> 01:15:33.210
Then he...

1225
01:15:33.243 --> 01:15:35.813
he got on his horse
and he rode away.

1226
01:15:38.815 --> 01:15:40.051
But not all of him.

1227
01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:42.953
No. See, he...

1228
01:15:42.987 --> 01:15:44.889
he left a tiny little
piece of himself

1229
01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:46.623
buried deep inside of me.

1230
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:48.893
Like a seed.

1231
01:15:48.926 --> 01:15:51.095
[suspenseful music]

1232
01:16:04.207 --> 01:16:08.578
[tense music]

1233
01:16:18.756 --> 01:16:21.826
Workin' on
a little insurance policy.

1234
01:16:21.859 --> 01:16:24.561
We don't need those
boys gettin' any ideas

1235
01:16:24.595 --> 01:16:26.130
about running off
with the money.

1236
01:16:27.998 --> 01:16:30.201
[chuckles] It used to be
you couldn't find nothing

1237
01:16:30.234 --> 01:16:31.801
around these parts
except tequila.

1238
01:16:34.137 --> 01:16:36.106
Finding whiskey in Santa Rosa?

1239
01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.240
It's progress.

1240
01:16:39.577 --> 01:16:42.645
You see, the problem
with progress

1241
01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.114
is that something's gonna go.

1242
01:16:44.148 --> 01:16:46.317
In with the new,

1243
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:47.551
out with the old.

1244
01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:50.887
That's the way of the world.

1245
01:16:52.922 --> 01:16:54.190
But this transition...

1246
01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:01.297
Oh, it's rarely a peaceful one.
No, ma'am.

1247
01:17:01.332 --> 01:17:03.167
Transition of power
is one of violence.

1248
01:17:03.199 --> 01:17:04.801
Necessary violence.

1249
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:08.939
Which is why we're here today.

1250
01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.307
You see...

1251
01:17:12.943 --> 01:17:15.679
I got a monster inside of me.

1252
01:17:15.712 --> 01:17:18.048
The devil himself.

1253
01:17:18.082 --> 01:17:19.949
That devil can't get out

1254
01:17:19.984 --> 01:17:22.184
as long as there's another
devil out there in the world.

1255
01:17:22.752 --> 01:17:25.221
Both these devils...

1256
01:17:25.256 --> 01:17:26.957
can't exist at the same time.

1257
01:17:28.993 --> 01:17:30.194
Oh, I get it.

1258
01:17:31.962 --> 01:17:33.064
You're crazy.

1259
01:17:36.167 --> 01:17:39.270
But don't worry, my father will
be here soon. He'll fix that.

1260
01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:43.873
[James] Hmm, you know,

1261
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:48.345
I'm glad we had
this time together.

1262
01:17:48.378 --> 01:17:51.047
Get to know each other
as siblings.

1263
01:17:52.682 --> 01:17:54.118
'Cause after tonight,

1264
01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:56.087
after your father gets here...

1265
01:17:59.023 --> 01:18:00.925
well, I'm gonna be
your new daddy.

1266
01:18:02.359 --> 01:18:04.127
And we'll see what needs fixin'.

[grunts] Oh, he's here.

1272
01:19:00.484 --> 01:19:01.752
Eustice!

1273
01:19:01.784 --> 01:19:03.186
He's here!

1274
01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.220
Help!

1275
01:19:05.457 --> 01:19:06.923
He's here.

1279
01:19:24.073 --> 01:19:25.909

[gunshots]

1281
01:19:31.215 --> 01:19:33.050
He's here!

1282
01:19:33.082 --> 01:19:34.318
He done killed Big Mike,

1283
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:35.752
and got one of them
Mexican cowboys!

1284
01:19:37.854 --> 01:19:39.823
The devil does not disappoint.

1285
01:19:41.391 --> 01:19:43.092
Let's go see Pa.

1286
01:19:48.765 --> 01:19:49.867
Walk.

1289
01:20:01.145 --> 01:20:02.279
He went down that alley,

01:20:02.313 --> 01:20:04.215
behind these buildings.

1291
01:20:04.247 --> 01:20:05.449
Go around and flush him out.

1292
01:20:07.784 --> 01:20:09.453
Christ Almighty.

1293
01:20:09.487 --> 01:20:11.854
Eustice, did you hear what said?

1294
01:20:11.889 --> 01:20:12.889
Go!

1296
01:20:23.234 --> 01:20:24.768
I got you, <i>pendejo.</i>

1297
01:20:43.319 --> 01:20:44.456
You see him?

1298
01:20:44.488 --> 01:20:45.889
He must've circled back.

1299

I got him! He got Boots,
but I shot him!

1303
01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:03.475
- Is he dead?
- [Eustice] No. I only winged him.

1304
01:21:03.507 --> 01:21:06.342
But he's got a bullet in him,
sure as shit.

1305
01:21:06.377 --> 01:21:09.145
He's holed up in that building
over there by the alley.

1306
01:21:09.179 --> 01:21:11.047
You're sure about that?

1307
01:21:11.081 --> 01:21:12.949
He seem like the type of
fella to just hole up

1308
01:21:12.983 --> 01:21:14.262
and wait for us to come get him?

1309
01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:18.087
Guess we'll see.

1311
01:21:28.265 --> 01:21:29.434
[James] You two.

1312
01:21:29.466 --> 01:21:31.135
You see that mercantile?

1313
01:21:31.167 --> 01:21:33.012
Now, the villain that killed
your buddy is inside.

1314
01:21:33.037 --> 01:21:34.605
Why don't you go
in there and get him?

1315
01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.519
I'll double your pay
if you bring him out alive.

1316
01:21:38.475 --> 01:21:41.011
Be careful now. He's a snake.

1317
01:21:41.045 --> 01:21:42.555
[Eustice] He may be
a snake but he ain't

1318
01:21:42.579 --> 01:21:44.180
- a Goddamn wizard.
- Eustice...

1319

[grunts]

1320
01:21:50.087 --> 01:21:51.889
[James] I need you
to just trust me.

1321
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:54.591
Can you do that?

1322
01:21:54.626 --> 01:21:56.470
Shame to have to let you
go so close to the end.

[James] Briggs!

1326
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:15.945
I'm calling you out.

1327
01:22:15.979 --> 01:22:18.948
Ain't that what
you boys used to do?

1328
01:22:18.981 --> 01:22:21.351
Call each other out?

1329
01:22:21.385 --> 01:22:23.220
Settle your differences
in the street?

1330
01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:28.292
Let's do this the old way!

Holster that pistol, Mister.

1334
01:22:55.487 --> 01:22:58.287
I swear to God,
I'll kill this little girl.

1335
01:23:09.533 --> 01:23:10.967
Hello, handsome.

1336
01:23:11.668 --> 01:23:12.668
Remember me?

1337
01:23:17.306 --> 01:23:19.444
No.

1338
01:23:19.476 --> 01:23:20.612
[Eustice]
Get your hands up.

1339
01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:25.349
Both of 'em.

1340
01:23:25.381 --> 01:23:27.216
It's busted.

1341
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:29.587
[Eustice] You got him, boss.
What are we gonna do?

1342
01:23:31.722 --> 01:23:33.390
You really don't remember me.

1343
01:23:36.326 --> 01:23:39.061
I gotta say, hurts my feelings.

1344
01:23:41.331 --> 01:23:43.233
But I guess it's
not too surprising.

1345
01:23:43.266 --> 01:23:46.470
I was just a little whooper
last time you saw me.

1346
01:23:46.503 --> 01:23:47.639
The important thing is...

1347
01:23:49.372 --> 01:23:50.408
I remember you.

1348
01:23:54.746 --> 01:23:56.180
Don't worry.

1349
01:23:56.212 --> 01:23:58.247
I'm okay.

1350
01:23:58.282 --> 01:24:01.118
I definitely remember you,
Colton Briggs.

1351
01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.253
Every time I close my eyes,

1352
01:24:05.622 --> 01:24:07.056
I see your face...

1353
01:24:08.358 --> 01:24:09.694
staring me down.

1354
01:24:12.162 --> 01:24:14.666
I smell the smoke
from your guns,

1355
01:24:14.698 --> 01:24:17.367
hear the noises my
daddy made as he died.

1356
01:24:19.136 --> 01:24:20.404
And that's why we're here.

1357
01:24:21.672 --> 01:24:23.306
You, me...

1358
01:24:24.509 --> 01:24:26.009
your little girl.

1359
01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:29.246
She never would
tell me her name,

1360
01:24:29.279 --> 01:24:32.349
but it don't matter none.

1361
01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:34.418
We're just one big happy family.

we're gonna have a showdown,
you and me.

1365
01:24:42.292 --> 01:24:45.796
And you get the opportunity
to put a bullet in my head

1366
01:24:45.829 --> 01:24:47.498
just like you did my daddy.

1367
01:24:48.632 --> 01:24:49.766
And if you do that,

1368
01:24:50.734 --> 01:24:52.470
Eustice here,

1369
01:24:52.503 --> 01:24:54.439
he's gonna blow
your little girl's head off.

- [Eustice] Boss, just kill him!
- Shut up!

Now...

you kill me...

1373
01:25:01.645 --> 01:25:03.279
and watch your little girl die.

1374
01:25:04.448 --> 01:25:06.518
Or save your daughter,

1375
01:25:06.551 --> 01:25:08.118

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.087
I killed him!

I'm so sorry, Daddy.
I love you so much.

1388
01:25:49.426 --> 01:25:50.394

I killed him!

1393
01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:01.471
You hear that, Daddy?

take your mother.

Found another body

That makes four of 'em.

1412
01:27:29.259 --> 01:27:31.228
[Jarrett] More or less
what I expected.

1413
01:27:31.261 --> 01:27:33.831

01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:41.471
Yeah, I suppose they will.

1417
01:27:42.539 --> 01:27:43.707
Thank you.

1418
01:27:48.011 --> 01:27:49.179
Marshal?

1419
01:27:51.948 --> 01:27:53.451
What are you going to tell them?

1420
01:27:56.353 --> 01:27:59.923
I thought I might bring you in
for what you and your daddy did.

1421
01:27:59.957 --> 01:28:04.895
Tell them how you captured us
and tortured us and...

1422
01:28:04.929 --> 01:28:07.497
left us to die
out in the desert.

1423
01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:11.802
But I suppose the judge would
just say that you were...

1424
01:28:11.836 --> 01:28:14.471
following your
daddy's orders and...

1425
01:28:14.505 --> 01:28:18.643
blind with rage over
your mama's murder...

1426
01:28:18.676 --> 01:28:21.546
even though you and I both
know that ain't quite true.

1427
01:28:22.947 --> 01:28:25.282
And in that case,

1428
01:28:25.314 --> 01:28:28.552
your daddy would be
buried as a criminal.

1429
01:28:28.586 --> 01:28:30.421
And you would go home

1430
01:28:30.454 --> 01:28:32.689
to try to figure out what to
do with your daddy's store.

1431
01:28:35.292 --> 01:28:37.694
Found a strongbox
in the saloon, Marshal.

1432
01:28:40.064 --> 01:28:41.666
Good work, Corporal.

1433
01:28:41.698 --> 01:28:42.934
That'll be all.

1434
01:28:48.072 --> 01:28:51.509
And then I considered telling
them that you and your daddy...

1435
01:28:51.542 --> 01:28:54.779
came along, and you
saved my deputy's life...

1436
01:28:54.811 --> 01:28:58.015
by performing field surgery
on his shoulder.

1437
01:28:58.048 --> 01:29:01.418
Then you proceeded to track
down your mother's murderers

1438
01:29:01.452 --> 01:29:06.355
and then he was killed in the
process of their apprehension

1439
01:29:06.389 --> 01:29:09.594
in which case you
would still go home.

1440
01:29:09.627 --> 01:29:11.595
So, I figure since the outcomes

1441
01:29:11.628 --> 01:29:14.564
in both those scenarios
are the same,

1442
01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:16.934
I prefer the story
that doesn't involve

1443
01:29:16.967 --> 01:29:19.470
me getting captured by
a 12-year-old girl.

1444
01:29:20.771 --> 01:29:22.974
And maybe in that version,

1445
01:29:23.006 --> 01:29:25.643
we can forget all about
that strong box, too.

1446
01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:28.880
In that version...

1447
01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.582
my daddy gets to be a hero?

1448
01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:35.987
[sighs]

1449
01:29:40.091 --> 01:29:42.827
In exchange for your discretion.

1450
01:29:42.859 --> 01:29:44.360
Yes.

1451
01:29:44.394 --> 01:29:47.731
I believe that
sounds about right.

1452
01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:49.298
Well then, it's decided.

1453
01:29:50.534 --> 01:29:51.702
Marshal?

1454
01:29:54.404 --> 01:29:55.640
Did you find your horse?

1455
01:29:56.774 --> 01:29:58.475
Tied up at the edge of town.

1456
01:30:01.878 --> 01:30:03.547
Just like he said.

1457
01:30:05.716 --> 01:30:08.452
You get on home, little Briggs.

1458
01:30:08.485 --> 01:30:10.020
Take care of your daddy's store.

1459
01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:13.591
- [horse snorts]
- H'yah.

[somber music playing]

1461
01:30:24.635 --> 01:30:26.368
You hear that, Daddy?

1462
01:30:27.771 --> 01:30:29.539
[crying] You're gonna be a hero.

1463
01:30:33.911 --> 01:30:35.813
Mama would be so proud.

1464
01:30:52.963 --> 01:30:54.564
Maria, isn't it?

1465
01:30:54.599 --> 01:30:56.500
<i>Si, Senorita.</i>

1466
01:30:56.533 --> 01:30:59.403
Why don't you fetch me
my brother's saddlebag

1467
01:30:59.436 --> 01:31:00.770
from inside the saloon?

1468
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.373
I best be getting on home.
