1
00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.625
Morning, gentlemen.

2
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.333
- You Augustus Landor?
- I am.

3
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.250
And you?

4
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.375
Captain Hitchcock at your service.
Second-in-command at the Academy.

5
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.833
I'm here to inform you

6
00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:14.791
Superintendent Thayer
requests an immediate audience.

7
00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.916
- And the nature of this audience?
- I'll leave that to the colonel.

8
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:21.791
- When might this take place?
- At your earliest convenience.

9
00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.416
And if I should decide not to come?

10
00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:34.291
That would be your own concern.
You're a private citizen.

11
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.208
Well, it's a fine day for a ride.

12
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.625
<i>The governor suggests
that you were a legend</i>

13
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.458
<i>among New York City constables.</i>

14
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.291
<i>And when he recommended your services,
he noted your impressive accomplishments,</i>

15
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.666
<i>including apprehending
the leaders of the Daybreak Boys,</i>

16
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.958
<i>breaking up the dreaded Shirt Tails gang,</i>

17
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:14.208
<i>and solving a particularly grisly murder
of a young prostitute in Elysian Fields.</i>

18
00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.250
<i>Your talents include
code breaking, riot control,</i>

19
00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.416
<i>and gloveless interrogation.</i>

20
00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:25.000
<i>You're a minister's son from Gloucester</i>

21
00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:27.416
<i>who came to New York
while still in your teens.</i>

22
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.375
<i>And you are a widower, Mr. Landor.</i>

23
00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:33.833
<i>Three years now.</i>

24
00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:39.125
- Shall I send for coffee?
- Beer will do nicely.

25
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.166
You, uh…

26
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:54.666
You keep these notes in a pigeonhole
back there somewhere, do you?

27
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.666
What else do they say?

28
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.958
Do they say that I haven't
darkened the door of a church

29
00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:01.625
in a long time?

30
00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:07.000
Does it mention
that my daughter ran off a while back?

31
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:11.916
We are aware
of your daughter's disappearance.

32
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.416
And we offer our sympathy.

33
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:18.500
With all due respect,
I hope I have not offended.

34
00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:21.166
No. No, no, no.

35
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.583
No, sorry. I ought to apologize.

36
00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:27.375
And I do. Please carry on.

37
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.083
Mr. Landor, we are obliged
to proceed with extreme discretion.

38
00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.708
We're looking for someone.

39
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:38.375
A private citizen
of well-documented industry and tact

40
00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.958
who might carry out inquiries
on the Academy's behalf.

41
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:44.125
Huh.

42
00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:46.625
They're of a highly complex
and delicate nature

43
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:49.333
and concern one of our cadets.

44
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.458
Second-year man
from Kentucky by the name of Fry.

45
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.916
- Leroy Fry.
- There's no point in dancing around it.

46
00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:01.041
Fry hanged himself… last night.

47
00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:04.000
Oh.

48
00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:06.541
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

49
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:12.458
A dreadful business, this.
But you must understand our position.

50
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:16.541
We have been specifically charged
with the care of these young men,

51
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:20.708
to make them gentlemen and soldiers,
and to that end, we drive them.

52
00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:26.000
But we'd like to think
we know when to… stop driving them.

53
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.750
A boy hangs himself…

54
00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:31.666
uh, that's a matter for the coroner.

55
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.750
I'm afraid
that's not the end of it.

56
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:41.500
Cadet Fry's body was
violated last night in the hospital ward.

57
00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:45.541
Violated? By whom?

58
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:48.958
Well, if we knew that, we would
have had no need to summon you.

59
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.833
I'm sure the Academy
has its share of pranksters.

60
00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:54.500
This was no prank, Mr. Landor.

61
00:05:56.375 --> 00:06:00.125
Leroy Fry's heart
was carved from his chest.

62
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:07.291
Dr. Marquis, how does
a person go about doing this?

63
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:13.708
Scalpel. Or any good,
sharp knife would do.

64
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.458
But getting to the heart,
that's the tricky part.

65
00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:24.416
Those gashes on the lungs and liver

66
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.625
came from angling
the blade to save the heart.

67
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:31.541
And how would one preserve the heart?

68
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.375
A container of some sort.

69
00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:38.541
Wrapped in muslin, maybe, or newspaper.

70
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:41.666
Very likely surrounded by ice.

71
00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.916
What type of fella could do this?

72
00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.708
A strong one.

73
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.500
Not a woman, then?

74
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:53.083
No woman as I've ever had
the pleasure of meeting, no.

75
00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.708
What about his medical pedigree?

76
00:06:55.791 --> 00:07:00.708
Would he need to be as well-educated
and well-trained as yourself?

77
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.416
Not necessarily.

78
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.083
He'd need a lot of light,
and know where to cut,

79
00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:11.500
but it wouldn't have to be
a doctor or a surgeon.

80
00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:13.166
- It'd have to be...
- A madman!

81
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.833
And still out there.

82
00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:20.000
Port arms!

83
00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:22.541
You'll have to forgive me,
Mr. Landor.

84
00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:24.791
You've found us
in a very delicate position.

85
00:07:24.875 --> 00:07:26.083
Left, face!

86
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:28.500
There are certain
powerful senators in Washington

87
00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:32.375
who would like nothing more than
to see us fail utterly, to shut us down.

88
00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:40.541
I'm asking you to help save the honor
of the United States Military Academy.

89
00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:43.041
And save it, I'll try.

90
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:51.333
You were, uh, on guard duty
last night, Mr. Huntoon.

91
00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:52.458
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:56.375
Post at 9:30. Relieved at midnight
and made my way back to the guardroom.

93
00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:57.625
Where is that?

94
00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.333
Number four, sir. By Fort Clinton.

95
00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:03.125
I… I admit, I'm not very familiar
with the grounds,

96
00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:05.916
but it seems that the part
we're standing on right now

97
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.583
is not on the way
from Fort Clinton to North Barracks.

98
00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:12.708
- No, sir.
- Oh. What took you off course?

99
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:15.500
Well, sir, on my way, I heard something.

100
00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:17.875
I reckoned it was an animal.

101
00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.375
It sounded like it was dying
or caught in a trap, so I came to help.

102
00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:23.541
I'm terribly partial to animals.

103
00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.416
Uh… I was running this way
until I brushed Cadet Fry, sir.

104
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.833
- How'd he look?
- Not well, sir.

105
00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.250
He wasn't hanging straight.

106
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.916
It was almost
as if he was seated in a chair.

107
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.666
I'm not following you.

108
00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.458
Well, his feet were
touching the ground, sir.

109
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:47.875
- His feet were touching the ground?
- Yes, sir.

110
00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:53.625
All right. What did you do next?

111
00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.541
I ran. Ran straight back
to North Barracks.

112
00:08:58.583 --> 00:08:59.416
Hmm.

113
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.875
Uh, one last question
and I'll trouble you no more.

114
00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.333
Did you see anyone else about?

115
00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:08.041
No, sir.

116
00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:12.125
Mr. Huntoon.

117
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
<i>The neck…</i>

118
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.583
That's what first struck me.

119
00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:25.208
See?

120
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:29.000
Not a clean cinch at all.
The rope grabbed at him

121
00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:33.083
and ran up and down the neck
looking for purchase.

122
00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:34.583
As though…

123
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:37.416
As though he was… fighting.

124
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:38.958
Hmm?

125
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:42.583
Look, if you would, at his fingers.

126
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:45.458
Blistered fresh
from clutching at the rope…

127
00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:50.125
…trying to peel the thing off him.

128
00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:52.416
May I ask what's going on here?

129
00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:55.875
This is, uh, quite irregular.

130
00:09:57.125 --> 00:10:01.500
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
feeling around the back of Mr. Fry's head.

131
00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:03.833
You did examine Mr. Fry?

132
00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:06.916
Of course I examined him, as is my job.

133
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.833
Hmm.

134
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:14.125
Haven't we already
been through this?

135
00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.375
- Uh…
- Hmm.

136
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.250
There is a contusion of sort.

137
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:34.625
Parietal region.

138
00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:37.875
Approximately three inches.

139
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.791
- I must have missed that.
- Mmm.

140
00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:48.791
Someone murdered Mr. Fry.

141
00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:52.000
Is this what
you're telling us, Mr. Landor?

142
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:55.166
You might be onto something there,
Captain Hitchcock.

143
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.166
Well, anyone
could have missed that, doctor.

144
00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:36.666
Mr. Landor.

145
00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:41.500
So now you're on board,

146
00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:45.083
I think it's important
we set some ground rules.

147
00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:49.750
You will report to me
on a daily basis and I to the colonel.

148
00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:54.666
And you mustn't breathe a word of this
to anyone, inside or outside the Academy.

149
00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:58.666
- Is that all?
- One final condition.

150
00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:03.875
There will be no drinking throughout
the course of this investigation.

151
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:08.250
Your reputation precedes you.

152
00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:34.958
Oh.

153
00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:35.875
Pardon.

154
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.416
- Are you Augustus Landor?
- I am.

155
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.500
Unless I mistake, you've been
tasked with solving the mystery

156
00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:44.125
surrounding Leroy Fry.

157
00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:46.416
That's so. What might I do for you?

158
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.250
It is incumbent upon me
and the honor of this institution

159
00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:53.583
to divulge some of the conclusions
which I have reached.

160
00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:54.625
Conclusions?

161
00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:57.000
Regarding the late Mr. Fry.

162
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.625
I'd be most interested.

163
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.333
The man you're looking for

164
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.250
is a poet.

165
00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:16.583
Private Cochrane.

166
00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:20.666
When Leroy Fry's body
was brought back to the hospital,

167
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.333
you were detailed to guard it?

168
00:13:23.416 --> 00:13:24.625
I was, sir.

169
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.291
- Did anything happen while on watch?
- Not till around 2:30.

170
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.708
- That's when I was relieved of my duty.
- Who relieved you?

171
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:38.333
- Private, who relieved you?
- I can't tell you, sir.

172
00:13:39.416 --> 00:13:40.916
Only that it was an officer.

173
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.541
- He never identified himself?
- No, sir.

174
00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:47.291
But I wouldn't expect it of an officer.

175
00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:49.583
Hmm.

176
00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:51.333
What did this officer say to you?

177
00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:56.541
He said, "Thank you, private.
That will be all. I'm relieving you."

178
00:13:56.625 --> 00:14:00.291
- An odd request, no?
- Yes, sir. Very.

179
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.666
- Did you see this officer's face?
- No, sir.

180
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.875
I had only a candle. It was terribly dark.

181
00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.750
Right, tell me then,
how did you know it was an officer?

182
00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:15.416
The bar on his shoulder, sir.
But I must admit, it was so very strange.

183
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.375
- How so?
- The bars.

184
00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:20.625
The bars on his left shoulder
were missing.

185
00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:40.916
Ah, there's the man himself.

186
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.958
Benny knows a man
who's in need of a drink when he sees one.

187
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:49.125
The very sight of it warms my blood.

188
00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:51.375
- Benny!
- Sir.

189
00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.708
- Here's… to rules.
- Fuck 'em.

190
00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:02.625
Patsy.

191
00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:04.458
Patsy!

192
00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:05.541
What's grieving you?

193
00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:09.958
Did you hear about that poor cadet?

194
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.583
- They say it took him hours to die.
- "They"?

195
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:17.666
Him.

196
00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:34.083
Aren't you meant to be in recital?

197
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.750
Uh… Good evening. Recital?

198
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.291
No, I won't be missed.

199
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.791
They hardly know I'm at the Academy.

200
00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:45.000
And besides, I've learned more
in rooms like this than any classroom.

201
00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.250
I don't doubt it.

202
00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:50.875
Sit, please. Please, sit. Have a… Have a…

203
00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.541
- Seat?
- Seat. Thank you. Uh…

204
00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:56.708
Fourth Classman Poe. E. A. Poe.

205
00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.208
Edgar A. Poe.

206
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.333
Worked up quite a thirst, I see.

207
00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:05.041
Helps take the bite off the gloom.

208
00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:11.791
Um…

209
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:17.833
So tell me, how did you learn
about Leroy Fry?

210
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:21.333
Uh, well, from Huntoon, of course.

211
00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:25.625
He has been spouting the news
like the town crier.

212
00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.916
Perhaps someone
might hang <i>him</i> before too long.

213
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.916
You don't mean to imply
that someone <i>hanged</i> Mr. Fry?

214
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.916
I don't mean to imply anything.

215
00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:43.458
Why do you think that the man
who cut Leroy Fry's heart out

216
00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:45.166
was a poet?

217
00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:46.791
Well…

218
00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:51.750
The heart is a symbol or it is nothing.

219
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:54.583
Now take away the symbol
and what do you have?

220
00:16:56.291 --> 00:17:00.791
It's a fistful of muscle of no more
aesthetic interest than a bladder.

221
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.083
Now, to remove a man's heart
is to traffic in symbol.

222
00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:07.250
And who better equipped for such labor

223
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:09.875
than a poet?

224
00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:13.750
Awfully literal-minded poet,
it would seem...

225
00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:16.333
Oh, you cannot pretend
that this act of savagery

226
00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:21.958
did not startle the literary resonances
from the very crevices of your mind.

227
00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:27.041
Lord Suckling's charming song,

228
00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:31.125
<i>"I prithee send me back my heart
Since I cannot have thine"</i>

229
00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:33.333
Or… Or the Bible even,

230
00:17:33.416 --> 00:17:35.291
"Create in me a clean heart, O God."

231
00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:39.416
"A broken and a contrite heart
thou wilt not despise."

232
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:44.500
Then we might just as easily
be seeking a religious maniac.

233
00:17:44.583 --> 00:17:49.208
No, you see, I neglected
to tell you that I am a poet myself,

234
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:50.916
hence inclined to think as one.

235
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.333
I don't get around to poetry much.

236
00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:56.875
Why should you? You're an American.

237
00:17:58.541 --> 00:17:59.541
And you?

238
00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:03.708
An artist.
That is to say, without country.

239
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:07.333
- Oh…
- What, Mr. Landor?

240
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:09.708
You've been a great help.

241
00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:16.916
You want a second look
at a cadet named Loughborough.

242
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:22.833
In former days, Leroy Fry's roommate,
until they had a falling out.

243
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:27.375
The nature of which remains uncertain.

244
00:18:47.416 --> 00:18:48.708
Mr. Loughborough.

245
00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:53.208
Tell Mr. Landor
how you were acquainted with Mr. Fry.

246
00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:56.000
Yes, sir. We were roommates.

247
00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:56.916
Hmm.

248
00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:00.750
You ever have a falling out?

249
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:04.833
I wouldn't call it a falling out. Just…

250
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:09.625
a matter of diverging paths, sir.

251
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.958
- What made you diverge?
- Well…

252
00:19:12.875 --> 00:19:14.208
Nothing so…

253
00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:17.416
A matter of course.

254
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.916
If you know of anything
pertaining to Mr. Fry,

255
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.833
you're bound to disclose it at once.

256
00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:25.666
Well, it's like this, sir.

257
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.958
I'd say he'd fallen in with

258
00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:32.833
a bad bunch.

259
00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.166
At least that's what he called them.

260
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:41.083
Now then, tell me,
by "bad bunch,"

261
00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:43.041
did he mean other cadets?

262
00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:46.333
He never said, but I assumed so.

263
00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:48.750
And why didn't you come forward earlier?

264
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:52.041
I didn't quite see
that it had any bearing,

265
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.291
happening so long ago, sir.

266
00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.500
Dismissed.

267
00:20:02.541 --> 00:20:03.750
Mr. Stoddard.

268
00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:08.625
You were the last one
to see Mr. Fry alive.

269
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.166
Yes, sir.

270
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.583
- Speak up.
- I'm just a bit ill, sir.

271
00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:18.125
I did see Leroy
late on the night in question.

272
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:21.500
Passed him on the way
to barracks as I was coming in.

273
00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:24.208
You spoke to him?

274
00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:27.625
He stopped me,
asking if any officers were about.

275
00:20:28.708 --> 00:20:29.791
How did Mr. Fry look?

276
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.875
It was so very dark.
I… I wouldn't trust my memory.

277
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:39.083
Did you see anything
on his person, a length of rope, maybe?

278
00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:41.666
- None that I could see.
- Hmm.

279
00:20:43.791 --> 00:20:45.541
There was something. Uh…

280
00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:49.875
As Fry was leaving, I did ask
where he was off to at such an hour.

281
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500
And?

282
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:54.500
He said, "Necessary business."

283
00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:57.458
What did you take that to mean?

284
00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.166
I don't know.

285
00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:06.625
Dismissed.

286
00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:19.750
- Pardon me, captain.
- Yes.

287
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:31.875
Christ almighty.

288
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:37.416
"A cow and sheep have been
murdered and mutilated in Cold Spring."

289
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.000
"Their chests most cruelly carved open
and their hearts removed."

290
00:21:42.583 --> 00:21:45.583
Are any of God's creatures
immune from this man?

291
00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:48.208
We don't know that this is the same man.

292
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.125
What?

293
00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:52.416
Coincidence, is it?

294
00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:58.000
Effective 0600 tomorrow morning,

295
00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:03.291
all men will only attend
class, meals, prayer services.

296
00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:04.958
Nothing more!

297
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:17.583
If any of your classmates ask,

298
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:20.583
we did nothing more than discuss
your acquaintance with Leroy Fry.

299
00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:23.166
There was no acquaintance.
I never knew him.

300
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.041
- What?
- I never knew the fellow.

301
00:22:25.583 --> 00:22:28.708
- Then I misunderstood you.
- Huh. You're not the first.

302
00:22:29.458 --> 00:22:31.708
So, if this is not a discussion,
what is it?

303
00:22:32.916 --> 00:22:34.125
An offer of employment.

304
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.250
There's no pay.

305
00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:40.458
None of your classmates
may know what you're doing

306
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:43.750
until long after you're done with it.

307
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:47.583
If they do find out,
they'll likely curse your name.

308
00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:51.458
Oh! An irresistible offer.

309
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:53.875
No, um, please, tell me more.

310
00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:59.500
Excellent. I need you to decipher this…
This segment of a larger note.

311
00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:04.000
You'll have to work secretly
and as precisely as you can.

312
00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:06.791
I am pleased to report
I have successfully decoded your message.

313
00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:11.166
Hmm. Handwritten,
it is of a personal nature.

314
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.583
Fry had it with him
at the time of his death.

315
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:15.833
From that,
we may presume it was sufficient

316
00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:19.083
to draw him from his barracks
on the night in question.

317
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:22.208
As the rest of the message
was torn from his hand,

318
00:24:22.291 --> 00:24:25.875
we may presume that the note,
in some way, identified its sender.

319
00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:28.833
Now the use
of rather primitive black capitals

320
00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:32.750
would also indicate that the sender
wished to disguise his identity.

321
00:24:32.833 --> 00:24:38.666
An invitation of sorts, or might we
more accurately call it a trap.

322
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.416
A trap?

323
00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:42.458
Hmm.

324
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:45.916
- Now, with that in mind… Oh, may I?
- Mmm-hmm.

325
00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:49.708
Let's concentrate
our labors on the third line

326
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:51.833
which we know, for a fact, is complete.

327
00:24:51.916 --> 00:24:53.416
"Be." But be what?

328
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.541
Something that begins with "L."

329
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.458
"Little"? "Lucky"?

330
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:04.125
No. Neither gibes with the invitation.

331
00:25:04.208 --> 00:25:09.000
"Be lost"?
No. No. Too ungainly a construction.

332
00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:13.125
If in fact Leroy Fry's attendance was
desired at a particular time and place,

333
00:25:13.208 --> 00:25:15.958
there is but one word, "late."

334
00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:18.958
"Be late."

335
00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:21.208
And as we scan the third line,

336
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:26.041
the first word becomes almost
insultingly simple to deduce, "don't."

337
00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:29.625
So, "Don't be late."

338
00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:33.791
Now, look closely, Mr. Landor.

339
00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:36.333
We need not journey far
for a suitable candidate.

340
00:25:37.125 --> 00:25:40.333
If Fry is going
to a predetermined location,

341
00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:43.916
he was, from the perspective
of the writer, coming.

342
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.041
So, "Come, Mr. Fry."

343
00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:50.125
Now, with that in place,
it is the height of simplicity

344
00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:53.625
to deduce the next word.
Can it be any other than "soon"?

345
00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:56.125
We insert the word, <i>et voilà!</i>

346
00:25:56.208 --> 00:25:58.541
"Don't be late. Come soon."

347
00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:02.083
And there you have it,
the solution to our <i>petite énigme</i>

348
00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:05.083
- respectfully submitted.
- Mmm-hmm.

349
00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:13.625
First-rate work. I thank you.

350
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:16.333
- Just one thing.
- Yes?

351
00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:18.750
Did you have any luck
with the first two lines?

352
00:26:18.833 --> 00:26:21.416
Well, I was forced to declare them a loss.

353
00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:23.583
Are you a good speller?

354
00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:26.000
Oh, flawless. Judged so
by no less an authority

355
00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:29.250
than the Reverend John Bransby
of Stoke Newington.

356
00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:35.875
So I take it that you've never done
what so many of… us do.

357
00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:39.791
Misspell similar sounding words.

358
00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:46.916
For example,
"they're," "their," and "there."

359
00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:50.000
A common solecism.

360
00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:52.625
An invitation indeed. "Meet me there."

361
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:57.125
Of course, we still don't know
where to meet, do we?

362
00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:02.041
Something with "N-G" trailing behind.

363
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:04.958
The landing!

364
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.750
- And might I add, the cove by the landing.
- Excellent choice.

365
00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:14.958
So, "I'll be at the cove by the landing."

366
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:17.125
"Meet me there at say, 11:00 p.m. or so."

367
00:27:17.208 --> 00:27:21.541
So, "Don't be late. Come see me."
Might be closer to the mark.

368
00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:23.041
- Yeah.
- Ah…

369
00:27:23.125 --> 00:27:25.166
Does this suggest anything to you?

370
00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:28.083
Why would he meet
a fellow cadet at the landing

371
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:30.541
- when you can meet him anywhere?
- Hmm.

372
00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:37.500
Because it's not a cadet, but a woman.

373
00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:38.416
Hmm.

374
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:43.500
You knew the solution
all along, Mr. Landor.

375
00:27:43.583 --> 00:27:44.708
I had an idea.

376
00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:49.125
Well, if this is indeed a woman we seek,

377
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:54.083
I believe I may be credited
with a sighting of her.

378
00:27:56.083 --> 00:28:00.625
The morning after Leroy Fry's death,
before I knew anything of what had passed,

379
00:28:02.541 --> 00:28:07.250
I awoke, and began speaking
the opening lines of a poem,

380
00:28:09.125 --> 00:28:14.041
<i>lines that speak of a mysterious woman
in profound distress.</i>

381
00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:20.625
<i>Then, just outside the mess,
appears the most beautiful creature</i>

382
00:28:20.708 --> 00:28:23.041
<i>I've ever had the pleasure
of laying eyes on.</i>

383
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:29.750
<i>Who was she?</i>

384
00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:32.958
I haven't the faintest.

385
00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:37.791
But why do you believe that this poem
or young woman are connected with Mr. Fry?

386
00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:39.916
The air of concealed violence.

387
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:43.625
Unspeakable duress.

388
00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:46.750
An unknown woman.

389
00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:51.291
You could have woken
any morning and written this.

390
00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:55.166
But I didn't write it. It was dictated.

391
00:28:55.791 --> 00:28:57.458
- Dictated?
- Mmm-hmm.

392
00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:00.125
By whom?

393
00:29:02.666 --> 00:29:03.500
My mother.

394
00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:08.041
She's dead.

395
00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:12.083
Dead nearly, uh, 20 years.

396
00:29:19.416 --> 00:29:21.750
<i>Tell me about this Poe fella.</i>

397
00:29:24.583 --> 00:29:26.000
Oh, Poe, he…

398
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.541
A lovely boy.

399
00:29:31.416 --> 00:29:35.583
Beautiful manners. Um… Talks a lot.

400
00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:40.583
Definitely. And definitely
something peculiar about him.

401
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.791
Because he talks a lot?

402
00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:45.291
No, because he's filled
with senseless fantasies.

403
00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:48.000
Tells me about a poem,

404
00:29:48.083 --> 00:29:51.916
claims it has something
to do with Leroy Fry's death.

405
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.958
Claims it was dictated to him
in his sleep by his dead mother.

406
00:30:05.541 --> 00:30:10.375
You of all people know
that the people we lost…

407
00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:14.125
are always with us.

408
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:23.625
Man will do most anything
to cheat death, won't he?

409
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.166
<i>A container of some sort.</i>

410
00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:27.708
<i>Wrapped in muslin, maybe, or newspaper.</i>

411
00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:30.375
<i>Very likely surrounded by ice.</i>

412
00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:55.000
Good. My note reached you.

413
00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:56.791
- Were you followed?
- Followed?

414
00:34:57.375 --> 00:34:59.708
How unprofessional. Certainly not.

415
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:05.791
- What is this?
- The scene of the crime.

416
00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:08.833
The second… crime.

417
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:12.750
Where Fry's heart was brought.

418
00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:16.500
You mentioned the taking
of Fry's heart drew you to the Bible.

419
00:35:16.583 --> 00:35:19.208
I must admit.
I was already moving in that direction.

420
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:21.916
Not to the Bible.

421
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.333
But to religion.

422
00:35:25.833 --> 00:35:30.291
This… This does appear to render
a ceremony of some sort.

423
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:33.875
Blood and candles placed
in an intentional manner.

424
00:35:38.166 --> 00:35:41.291
- A circle.
- Mmm. And a triangle.

425
00:35:42.916 --> 00:35:47.833
And Fry's heart very likely placed inside.

426
00:35:53.541 --> 00:35:56.708
I have an old friend
who might be of some use.

427
00:36:04.625 --> 00:36:09.000
<i>Professor Jean Pépé
is an expert in symbols…</i>

428
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.791
- Pépé!
<i>- …Rituals…</i>

429
00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:14.083
<i>- …the occult.</i>
- Professor!

430
00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:15.083
<i>Pépé might be</i>

431
00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:17.541
<i>- the most peculiar man…</i>
- Come in. I'm back here.

432
00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:20.583
- Sorry to intrude.
<i>- …I've had the pleasure of coming across.</i>

433
00:36:20.666 --> 00:36:24.625
I, uh, bring something curious
I would like you to observe.

434
00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:26.041
Uh…

435
00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:30.041
This can only be a magic circle.

436
00:36:31.083 --> 00:36:34.208
I remember seeing it in
<i>Le Véritable Dragon Rouge.</i>

437
00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:37.708
And if I recall all right,
the magician would stand there

438
00:36:39.041 --> 00:36:40.333
in the triangle.

439
00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:42.083
Alone?

440
00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:44.833
Well, he might have
a group of assistants.

441
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:47.875
And candles and torches
on either side, light everywhere,

442
00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:49.916
a festival of light, in fact.

443
00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:55.416
Now, Gus, if you go to the third shelf…

444
00:36:56.375 --> 00:36:58.125
On the second to the top.

445
00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:01.125
That volume on the top.

446
00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:05.375
Yes. Yes.

447
00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:11.583
Pierre de Lancre,
redoubtable witch hunter.

448
00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:17.375
- You read French, Mr. Poe?
- Well, yes.

449
00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:20.208
Please read in silence.
It's in the center page.

450
00:37:22.708 --> 00:37:25.875
De Lancre executed 600 Basque witches

451
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.666
and left behind
the remarkable volume you now peruse.

452
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.291
But the book I wish to give you,
<i>Discours du Diable</i> by Henri Le Clerc,

453
00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:38.125
who executed 700 witches
before he was done,

454
00:37:38.208 --> 00:37:39.958
is reputed to have been destroyed.

455
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:44.541
Now, rumor has it that he left behind
two or three other volumes

456
00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.875
identical to the one destroyed.

457
00:37:47.958 --> 00:37:53.000
Now, finding one has become
the <i>idée fixe</i> of many an occult collector.

458
00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:57.333
- Why?
- Why? Ooh…

459
00:37:57.416 --> 00:38:01.958
Le Clerc left behind instructions
for securing…

460
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.250
immortality.

461
00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:06.875
Oh, my Lord.

462
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:13.125
"It is commonly known
among the fraternity of evil angels

463
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.833
that the contents
of a witch's sabbath feast

464
00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:20.041
are confined to the following sundries."

465
00:38:20.125 --> 00:38:24.458
"Unclean animals such as are
never eaten by Christian peoples,

466
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.291
the hearts of unbaptized children,

467
00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:33.333
and the hearts of hanged men."

468
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.958
<i>I need you
to discretely infiltrate the cadets,</i>

469
00:38:50.041 --> 00:38:53.500
<i>see if you can ferret out which of them
may have a connection to the occult.</i>

470
00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:55.708
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

471
00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:59.125
Well, um, certain overtures
have been made to me,

472
00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:01.958
rather dark, and shall I say,
unchristian overtures.

473
00:39:02.041 --> 00:39:03.000
- Unchristian?
- Yes.

474
00:39:03.083 --> 00:39:06.000
I've been spurred to question
the very grounds of my faith.

475
00:39:06.083 --> 00:39:09.833
And to dabble in mysterious and arcane
practices of an ancient provenance.

476
00:39:09.916 --> 00:39:12.791
- Arcane practices?
- He means black magic. Who was it?

477
00:39:12.875 --> 00:39:14.375
I demand to know.

478
00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:16.208
I'm honor bound
not to reveal his name.

479
00:39:16.291 --> 00:39:17.125
Who was it?

480
00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:18.416
You can't drag it from me,

481
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.666
not if God himself threatened
to smite me with a lightning bolt.

482
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.333
- If you want to join our prayers...
- No, I gave my word.

483
00:39:24.416 --> 00:39:27.166
- One asks you to question your faith...
- It must stay private.

484
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:28.333
Was it Marquis?

485
00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.458
Hamilton, watch yourself.

486
00:39:31.916 --> 00:39:34.791
<i>Yes, I have a name,
but I need a face to go with it.</i>

487
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.083
- Vertigo, hmm?
- Mmm.

488
00:39:47.333 --> 00:39:49.666
Well, things are swirling about.

489
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.625
Your heart rate is rather quick.

490
00:39:54.875 --> 00:39:58.375
Very well, Mr. Poe,
keep to the house today

491
00:39:58.458 --> 00:40:00.125
and take care of yourself.

492
00:40:01.125 --> 00:40:05.791
Present this to Lieutenant Locke
and his cadet commandeer,

493
00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:08.041
Artemus, my son.

494
00:40:09.166 --> 00:40:12.333
He'll make sure
you're relieved of your duties.

495
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:18.250
You wish to be excused
from class because you were feeling

496
00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:20.333
vertiginous?

497
00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:23.375
And an even worse ailment not noted.

498
00:40:24.083 --> 00:40:25.458
A grand ennui seizure.

499
00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:27.958
"Grand ennui"?

500
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:30.416
Of a most pronounced character.

501
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.000
Mind yourself, Poe.

502
00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:33.875
You may ask the doctor yourself.

503
00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:38.500
It's true, Lieutenant.

504
00:40:39.166 --> 00:40:41.791
My father did tell me
he's never seen anything quite like it.

505
00:40:41.875 --> 00:40:42.875
Very well.

506
00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:47.166
But I am charging you
with unbecoming brazenness.

507
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:48.666
Three demerits.

508
00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:51.666
Return at once to your quarters.

509
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.833
And you would best be there when
the officers come around for inspection.

510
00:41:08.708 --> 00:41:10.916
- Poe, is it?
- Yes.

511
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.375
Artemus Marquis.

512
00:41:13.208 --> 00:41:16.000
I must say, your brazenness is admirable.

513
00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:21.083
Tonight, eleven o'clock.
18 North Barracks.

514
00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:28.916
Apologies for my tardiness.
I hope I haven't kept you too long.

515
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:31.708
This is lovely.

516
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.208
Books!

517
00:41:40.583 --> 00:41:42.458
You have never interested me more.

518
00:41:43.208 --> 00:41:45.625
Where to begin? Oh…

519
00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:51.958
The lamentable Fenimore Cooper.
I guess every library must have one.

520
00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:54.416
Ooh, what a collection.

521
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:58.041
History of Egypt, and all sorts.

522
00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:06.416
You've been found out.

523
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.333
Oh?

524
00:42:08.916 --> 00:42:11.000
You gave me to understand
you didn't read poetry.

525
00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:12.791
I don't.

526
00:42:14.916 --> 00:42:15.916
Byron!

527
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:19.916
- A personal favorite, Mr. Landor…
- Please.

528
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
…and might I say, terribly well-thumbed.

529
00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:23.708
That's my daughter's.

530
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:37.375
And your daughter is no longer here?

531
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:40.958
No. No, she ran off with someone.

532
00:42:42.666 --> 00:42:43.541
Someone you knew?

533
00:42:44.916 --> 00:42:45.875
In passing.

534
00:42:46.916 --> 00:42:48.291
And she's never to return?

535
00:42:50.791 --> 00:42:51.791
Not likely.

536
00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:55.416
Then we're both alone in this world.

537
00:42:57.125 --> 00:42:58.541
But you have your mother.

538
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:01.833
She still speaks to you.

539
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.208
- At any rate.
- Yes.

540
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:06.541
Yes, from time to time.

541
00:43:07.375 --> 00:43:12.541
And I might add, whatever's good in me,
in person, in spirit, comes from her.

542
00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:19.250
Your daughter. What's her name?
If you don't object.

543
00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:22.583
Mathilde.

544
00:43:25.875 --> 00:43:26.875
Mattie.

545
00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:32.333
You needn't say anymore, Mr. Landor.

546
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:40.583
- So you say you found something.
- Well, no. Better than that.

547
00:43:40.666 --> 00:43:43.916
Someone goes by the name Marquis.

548
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.416
The doctor.

549
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.000
No. His son, Artemus.

550
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:53.000
And I have tasked myself with maneuvering
into his impenetrable peer group.

551
00:43:55.208 --> 00:43:57.541
Here's another
good creature of God.

552
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:01.250
Courtesy of <i>la</i> divine Patsy.

553
00:44:02.416 --> 00:44:05.750
Are you going to report us
for defying curfew, Poe?

554
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:11.375
Do our wee transgressions offend thee?

555
00:44:11.458 --> 00:44:17.833
Not only am I not offended,
Mr. Ballinger, but, mmm…

556
00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:21.625
another round is in order.

557
00:44:27.708 --> 00:44:28.583
Drink it.

558
00:44:30.416 --> 00:44:31.833
All of it, woman.

559
00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:34.541
Ballinger, you really
are quite the bully tonight.

560
00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:35.458
Mmm.

561
00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:39.083
Another, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

562
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.375
Oh, I thank you.

563
00:44:46.166 --> 00:44:47.000
Mmm.

564
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.458
- I can do this all night.
- Uh-uh.

565
00:44:50.708 --> 00:44:51.708
Easy, Ballinger.

566
00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:55.041
I've gone to great trouble
to secure that mash.

567
00:44:56.125 --> 00:44:56.958
Poe.

568
00:44:58.125 --> 00:45:00.000
I understand you're a published poet.

569
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:03.541
I am told I evidence a humble gift.

570
00:45:04.083 --> 00:45:06.791
Well, then I demand
a public reading.

571
00:45:07.666 --> 00:45:09.750
- Pleasure us.
- Oh.

572
00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:16.791
<i>I met a lewd nude in Bermuda</i>

573
00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:19.208
<i>Who thought she was shrewd</i>

574
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.250
<i>I was shrewder</i>

575
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.791
<i>She thought it quite crude
To be wooed in the nude</i>

576
00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:28.416
<i>I pursued her
Subdued her and screwed her</i>

577
00:45:29.458 --> 00:45:31.125
Well done, Poe.

578
00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:32.875
Bravo.

579
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:39.083
Losing card… is a seven.

580
00:45:40.083 --> 00:45:42.333
Winning card… is a jack.

581
00:45:43.458 --> 00:45:44.333
Oh!

582
00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:46.541
Well, well, well.
It's your lucky day, Poe.

583
00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:48.083
Thank you.

584
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Is it true, Poe, that Detective Landor
interrogated you about Fry?

585
00:45:54.458 --> 00:45:59.208
He was mistakenly under the impression
that I was an intimate of Fry's.

586
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.500
Were you?

587
00:46:03.291 --> 00:46:04.125
I was not.

588
00:46:04.833 --> 00:46:08.041
Fitting that the only thing
that Fry could do to gain attention

589
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:10.541
was to hang himself.

590
00:46:11.833 --> 00:46:15.708
I think he hanged himself
in despair over being jilted by a lady.

591
00:46:15.791 --> 00:46:17.791
And what lady
might that be, Stoddard?

592
00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.708
What of your sister, Artemus?

593
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:23.000
Didn't she dazzle Fry?

594
00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:27.333
Oh, come now, Randy.

595
00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:30.500
You were closer to Fry
than anyone in this room.

596
00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:33.750
I don't believe
I was so near to him…

597
00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:34.750
…as you.

598
00:46:49.541 --> 00:46:52.166
All right. Where were we?

599
00:47:21.083 --> 00:47:22.291
Halt!

600
00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:26.250
Curfew not apply to you, Mr. Poe?

601
00:47:27.375 --> 00:47:28.541
Explain yourself.

602
00:47:28.625 --> 00:47:32.000
Candles were
to be extinguished three hours ago.

603
00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:33.750
I'm sorry, sir.

604
00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:37.958
Your apologies have always
rung hollow with me.

605
00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:42.375
Leroy Fry met his maker
when he too was out after curfew.

606
00:47:44.541 --> 00:47:46.750
Return to barracks at once.

607
00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:50.916
You're lucky you're not
digging your own grave.

608
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.458
Thank you, sir.

609
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:55.666
Pick up the pace.

610
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:35.458
Mattie?

611
00:49:50.083 --> 00:49:55.000
"Remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake, O Lord."

612
00:49:55.833 --> 00:49:59.333
"For in death
there is no remembrance of thee,

613
00:49:59.916 --> 00:50:03.500
in thy grave who shall give thee thanks?"

614
00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:06.375
"According to thy mercy,

615
00:50:06.916 --> 00:50:11.041
remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake, O Lord."

616
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.250
"Mine eye is consumed because of grief."

617
00:50:18.875 --> 00:50:21.708
You're Mr. Landor. Aren't you?

618
00:50:22.375 --> 00:50:23.208
I am.

619
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.125
I'm Leroy's mother.

620
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:31.666
I'd like you to have this.

621
00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:33.166
Leroy's diary.

622
00:50:34.625 --> 00:50:36.875
It goes back at least three years.

623
00:50:37.541 --> 00:50:39.166
I don't recall…

624
00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:41.375
I'm sorry.

625
00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:44.166
Terrible loss.

626
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:50.916
I don't recall any diary
being found with his personal effects.

627
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.875
It was Mr. Ballinger who sent it to me.

628
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:55.250
- Mr. Ballinger?
- Yes.

629
00:50:55.916 --> 00:50:58.000
As soon as he heard what had happened,

630
00:50:58.083 --> 00:51:01.625
he went straight to Leroy's quarters
to see what could be done.

631
00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:03.458
The dear boy mailed it to me.

632
00:51:03.541 --> 00:51:04.375
I see.

633
00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:08.750
And just now… as soon as he saw me,

634
00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:14.583
he said, "I thought you should have
Leroy's diary with you in Kentucky."

635
00:51:15.416 --> 00:51:17.958
"And if you feel like burning it,
go right ahead."

636
00:51:19.291 --> 00:51:20.583
How considerate of him.

637
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.291
But I can make no sense of it.

638
00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:25.750
All the numbers and letters…

639
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:30.875
But… seeing how the Army
is depending on you,

640
00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:33.625
it seems only right
that you should have it.

641
00:52:05.583 --> 00:52:08.875
I'll be back to meet you
all the time.

642
00:52:08.958 --> 00:52:10.875
- To manage her needs…
- I understand.

643
00:52:10.958 --> 00:52:12.875
…'cause all of us are in this together.

644
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:15.083
Doctor!

645
00:52:15.875 --> 00:52:19.541
Ah, Mr. Landor.
What a pleasant surprise.

646
00:52:20.125 --> 00:52:23.875
Uh, please, let me introduce you
to my wife, Julia.

647
00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:27.625
I've heard so much about you.

648
00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:29.125
It's a pleasure.

649
00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:32.958
Aren't you the gentleman
inquiring after Mr. Fry's death?

650
00:52:33.833 --> 00:52:34.666
I am.

651
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.833
Well, we were just discussing the matter.

652
00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:43.666
Indeed, my husband informs me
that despite his own heroic efforts,

653
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:49.625
the body of Mr. Fry had been judged
too far along for public display.

654
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:51.375
Hmm.

655
00:52:52.083 --> 00:52:54.208
His poor parents.

656
00:52:54.708 --> 00:52:55.708
Oh. Indeed.

657
00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:58.916
Well, this whole matter has shaken us.

658
00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:03.916
Be assured, I won't rest
until we've apprehended him.

659
00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:10.708
Lovely to make your acquaintance.

660
00:53:11.416 --> 00:53:12.500
My dear.

661
00:53:12.583 --> 00:53:15.833
I understand you're a widower, Mr. Landor.

662
00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:18.916
That is so.

663
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.708
Well, all due sympathy.

664
00:53:22.333 --> 00:53:25.833
Was it recent?
Your wife going to her reward?

665
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.541
Two years ago now.

666
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:33.041
Only a few months
after we moved to the Highlands.

667
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.916
A sudden illness, was it?

668
00:53:38.458 --> 00:53:39.291
Not sudden…

669
00:53:40.833 --> 00:53:41.666
enough.

670
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:46.375
Well, your sacrifices aren't lost on me.

671
00:53:47.583 --> 00:53:50.000
- Condolences.
- Thank you.

672
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.083
Hmm.

673
00:54:27.416 --> 00:54:28.333
Brava.

674
00:54:29.375 --> 00:54:32.166
Edgar, did I not tell you
my sister is a prodigy?

675
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:35.500
Marvelous, my dear.
Brought a tear to my eye.

676
00:54:35.583 --> 00:54:36.458
Yeah.

677
00:54:37.041 --> 00:54:39.125
A lovely run, Miss Marquis.

678
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:40.666
- Truly.
- Yes.

679
00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:43.375
Your immortality is assured.

680
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.958
I can't think of any woman
who wishes to be immortal, Randy.

681
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:50.375
I am at once reminded
of Sir Thomas Grey's,

682
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.750
<i>"Full many a flower
Is born to blush unseen"</i>

683
00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:56.583
<i>"And waste its sweetness
On the desert air"</i>

684
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.041
A favorite, Mr. Poe.

685
00:55:02.083 --> 00:55:05.250
And what do you think
of my little protégé?

686
00:55:06.166 --> 00:55:08.791
I think Mr. Poe is far beyond
being anyone's protégé.

687
00:55:09.625 --> 00:55:12.000
He's certainly not to be corrupted
by the likes of you.

688
00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:15.833
All right, Lea.

689
00:55:15.916 --> 00:55:19.333
That's enough now.
You need to rest before dinner.

690
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.875
- If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Lea.

691
00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:25.875
Randy, chairs.

692
00:55:26.583 --> 00:55:28.208
Stoddard, come on, man. Chess board.

693
00:55:29.958 --> 00:55:31.208
All right. I'm bored now.

694
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:33.541
I don't care! She's ill.

695
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:36.125
In her condition,
she shouldn't be entertaining at all.

696
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:37.708
Miss Marquis.

697
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:40.750
Oh, um… Pardon me.

698
00:55:44.833 --> 00:55:49.916
Nothing would afford me greater pleasure
than an audience with you on Saturday.

699
00:55:51.791 --> 00:55:56.291
I'm sure that's true, Mr. Poe,
but… I'm afraid I'm engaged Saturday.

700
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.208
Ah, I see.

701
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:01.375
Your coat and your hat, sir.

702
00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:04.250
Thank you, Eugenia. You needn't have.

703
00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:06.833
I could have fetched my coat myself.

704
00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:08.833
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

705
00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:13.000
You speak French, Mr. Poe.

706
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:16.666
With an accent that is rather charming.

707
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:24.083
So you propose this Saturday?

708
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:28.041
Or Sunday, if that's preferable.

709
00:56:29.916 --> 00:56:30.916
Or Monday, even.

710
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.250
And where do you propose this audience?

711
00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:35.916
Let me guess.
Gee's Point? Flirtation Walk?

712
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Oh, no, no, no.

713
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:38.875
Neither, I'm afraid, no.

714
00:56:39.708 --> 00:56:41.458
I had in mind the cemetery.

715
00:56:42.333 --> 00:56:43.833
- The cemetery?
- Mmm.

716
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.333
How interesting.

717
00:56:47.416 --> 00:56:48.750
Yes, I certainly think so.

718
00:56:51.666 --> 00:56:53.541
Well, I wish you good evening.

719
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.708
<i>It's all so bare now.</i>

720
00:57:54.625 --> 00:57:57.750
But to enjoy the Highlands
in the full extent of their glory,

721
00:57:58.291 --> 00:58:01.541
it must be seen immediately
after the fall of the leaf.

722
00:58:02.583 --> 00:58:03.416
Why is that?

723
00:58:04.125 --> 00:58:06.083
Vegetation does not improve,

724
00:58:06.166 --> 00:58:09.541
but rather obstructs
God's originating design.

725
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:11.458
A romantic.

726
00:58:12.916 --> 00:58:16.000
You do enjoy talking
about God and death, don't you?

727
00:58:16.625 --> 00:58:20.291
I do consider death
to be poetry's most exalted theme.

728
00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:29.208
Shall we?

729
00:58:33.708 --> 00:58:36.041
- A lovely spot.
- Yes, it's my favorite.

730
00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:44.333
How well it sits on you, morbidity.

731
00:58:46.125 --> 00:58:47.875
Suits you better than your uniform.

732
00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:52.666
The only one to match you is Artemus.

733
00:58:54.041 --> 00:58:57.333
I've never seen him dwell
in the realms of melancholy.

734
00:58:58.875 --> 00:59:02.041
He does consent
to visit our world for long intervals.

735
00:59:13.916 --> 00:59:16.541
<i>You know I believe it's possible
to dance on broken glass</i>

736
00:59:16.625 --> 00:59:18.250
<i>for some length of time.</i>

737
00:59:18.916 --> 00:59:20.125
Not forever.

738
00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:27.583
Yes, I can see you two
hold much in common.

739
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.166
I hope you aren't cold.

740
00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:42.458
The frigid climate
has clearly settled in for good.

741
00:59:42.541 --> 00:59:43.541
Please, let us not.

742
00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:47.166
Do not suppose I came here
to talk about the weather. How prosaic.

743
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.666
I'm sorry.
My sole concern was for your welfare.

744
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.000
Proceed then, by all means.

745
00:59:52.083 --> 00:59:55.750
Declare your undying love, so we may
both return home and be none the worse.

746
00:59:55.833 --> 00:59:58.458
- I was just saying...
- I'm sorry.

747
00:59:59.708 --> 01:00:02.166
Sorry, I'm being a horror,
and I have no idea why.

748
01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:06.333
You are cold.

749
01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:08.791
Miss Marquis, would you
like to borrow my cloak?

750
01:00:09.791 --> 01:00:11.750
- Quite all right.
- It's really no, um…

751
01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:12.666
I…

752
01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:16.000
- What?
- Miss Marquis.

753
01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:18.541
Lea! Lea!

754
01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:25.541
Lea! Lea? What's happening?

755
01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:26.458
Lea!

756
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:29.708
Lea.

757
01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:39.083
My God, Lea.

758
01:00:40.666 --> 01:00:41.833
Are you all right?

759
01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.083
- Lea?
- I'm rather fine.

760
01:00:56.666 --> 01:01:00.458
<i>Are you sure you're all right?
I was quite terrified.</i>

761
01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:03.625
<i>It happens.
It's nothing to worry about.</i>

762
01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:06.125
Your, um…

763
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.916
Your spirit so emboldens me
that I feel free to confess…

764
01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:19.458
my mother has
a kind of presence in my life.

765
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:23.583
My sleepings and my awakenings.

766
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.833
Yes. Yes.

767
01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:31.083
At times, I believe the dead haunt us
because we love them too little.

768
01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:36.250
We forget them, you see.
We don't mean to, but we do.

769
01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:42.833
I believe they feel most cruelly deserted,
and so they clamor for us.

770
01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:47.083
Perhaps it best we don't give
that too much thought.

771
01:01:58.291 --> 01:02:00.208
I want you to know how grateful I was…

772
01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.625
to open my eyes and find you there.

773
01:02:05.916 --> 01:02:07.291
To look deep within you

774
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:10.583
and find something
I would never have expected.

775
01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:13.666
Not in a thousand years.

776
01:02:15.666 --> 01:02:16.666
Thank you.

777
01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:14.500
Stop!

778
01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:26.041
Bastards ought to know
their fucking place.

779
01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:31.083
Stay away from Lea.

780
01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:34.708
Leave off!

781
01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:39.500
Leave off, Ballinger!

782
01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.958
Or you will be court-martialed!

783
01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:56.500
Ugly fuck.

784
01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:02.166
You all right?

785
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:06.000
Clearly that savage knows
that Lea prefers me to him.

786
01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:08.416
- And if he seeks to frighten me away...
- Frighten?

787
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.541
- He looked set on killing you.
- Killing me? Oh!

788
01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:16.291
Oh, no. Before I let him come
between me and my heart's desire,

789
01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.041
I will kill <i>him.</i>

790
01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:24.083
It's always been this way.
People underestimating me.

791
01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:27.250
Friends, classmates,
my very own benefactor.

792
01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:28.750
- Thank you, Patsy.
- Everyone.

793
01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:30.416
Everyone…

794
01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.625
but my dear mother.

795
01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:40.333
And thank you for assisting earlier.

796
01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:43.250
It's unlike me to be caught by surprise.

797
01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:47.333
And you surprise too. Don't you, Landor?

798
01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:50.750
I have no desire to offend,

799
01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:54.750
but you're much more sophisticated
than you present.

800
01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:59.708
Now, tell me, is it true
you once solicited a confession

801
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:02.250
with nothing more than a piercing look?

802
01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.333
With enough patience,

803
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.291
the suspect will often
interrogate himself.

804
01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.583
Well, you are most
delightful company, Landor.

805
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.666
I shall write a poem someday.

806
01:05:29.791 --> 01:05:33.208
Something that shall send
your name down through the ages.

807
01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:55.250
<i>Even after this attack,
you don't suspect Randy Ballinger?</i>

808
01:05:57.541 --> 01:05:59.125
So where does this leave you?

809
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.375
Your investigation.

810
01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.458
I'm interested in Artemus Marquis.

811
01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.041
I take it you know him?

812
01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:11.708
Well, who doesn't?

813
01:06:13.791 --> 01:06:15.416
<i>Glorious look to him.</i>

814
01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:20.208
<i>He'd almost have
to die young, wouldn't he?</i>

815
01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:26.250
<i>But I wouldn't have
picked him for the violent sort.</i>

816
01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:29.541
<i>Always, um, very cool.</i>

817
01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:33.416
<i>Perhaps he's not our man.</i>

818
01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:39.208
<i>There's a quality to him.
To his entire family.</i>

819
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:42.125
<i>They act like people
who are guilty of something.</i>

820
01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:48.291
Aren't all families guilty of something?

821
01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:58.166
- Captain.
- It's Mr. Ballinger.

822
01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:01.083
I'm afraid he's gone missing.

823
01:07:14.708 --> 01:07:16.291
Next to those rocks.

824
01:07:17.708 --> 01:07:19.166
Here on this side too.

825
01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:23.916
Up the hill.

826
01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:28.125
Cadet, right side.
Behind those trees.

827
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:29.958
Nothing here.

828
01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:43.666
Captain! Up here!

829
01:07:55.833 --> 01:07:56.833
My Lord.

830
01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:25.833
Mr. Ballinger's dissection
wasn't as clean as Fry's.

831
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.708
Suggesting it was performed
by different hands.

832
01:08:31.958 --> 01:08:34.583
As for the castration…

833
01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:38.750
Well, I'm…

834
01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:39.875
Castration?

835
01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:42.208
My God, Landor.

836
01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:45.833
We're no closer to finding
who's responsible for this

837
01:08:45.916 --> 01:08:47.291
than we were a month ago!

838
01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:48.875
We are closer.

839
01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.208
- It's only a matter of time.
- Tell me!

840
01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:55.583
Have you found
more evidence of satanic practices?

841
01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.541
What of the so-called officer
who persuaded Private Cochrane

842
01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:02.291
to abandon Leroy Fry's body?

843
01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:04.625
Or Fry's diary?

844
01:09:04.708 --> 01:09:07.833
Have you found a single clue
that might be of use?

845
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:13.875
A maniac is freely roaming these hills,
disemboweling my men.

846
01:09:13.958 --> 01:09:18.416
Men who barely carry out their duties,
hardly leave their barracks or sleep.

847
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.250
And if they can sleep,
do so with their muskets!

848
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.666
I'm beginning to believe
you no longer think I'm competent

849
01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.916
to undertake this investigation.

850
01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:34.166
Thank you, doctor.

851
01:09:41.541 --> 01:09:45.208
It's not your competence we question,
it's your allegiance.

852
01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:50.166
Is there any possibility that this
could have been the work of Mr. Poe?

853
01:09:51.208 --> 01:09:52.041
Poe?

854
01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:54.791
Just yesterday,
he was regaling his table mates

855
01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:58.500
with an heroic account
of his epic tussle with Mr. Ballinger,

856
01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:02.083
declaring that he
fully intended to kill him

857
01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:04.500
should they ever cross swords again.

858
01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.208
You've seen Poe.

859
01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:11.291
Can you honestly tell me
he subdued Ballinger?

860
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:15.083
No, there would have been no need.
Firearm would have turned the trick.

861
01:10:15.166 --> 01:10:17.583
Whatever his relations with Ballinger,

862
01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:21.958
there's no sign of any link
between Poe and Leroy Fry.

863
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:25.125
- They didn't even know each other.
- Oh, but they did.

864
01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:28.791
They had a tussle
of their own last summer.

865
01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:33.958
I don't suppose he ever volunteered
that bit of information, did he?

866
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.125
Then arrest him.

867
01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:43.958
Arrest him if you are so persuaded.

868
01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:45.958
All we have is motive.

869
01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:49.166
We're looking to you to supply evidence!

870
01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:54.958
Mr. Landor, do you harbor
a latent hostility toward this Academy?

871
01:10:55.541 --> 01:10:56.541
Is that it?

872
01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:05.208
I am risking my life
on behalf of your precious institution.

873
01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:09.250
But yes.

874
01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:16.875
I do believe that the Academy
takes away a young man's will.

875
01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:21.125
It fences him with regulations and rules.

876
01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:27.291
Deprives him of reason.
It makes him less human.

877
01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:32.125
Are you implying
the Academy is to blame for these deaths?

878
01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:36.500
Someone connected to the Academy, yes.
Hence, the Academy itself.

879
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.000
Well, that's absurd.

880
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:39.291
By your standard,

881
01:11:40.041 --> 01:11:44.000
every crime committed
by a Christian will be a stain on Christ.

882
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.541
And so it is.

883
01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:07.583
When I first asked you… to take this job,

884
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:16.166
you told me you never
had dealings with Leroy Fry, so, uh…

885
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.333
Let's start there. Well?

886
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:26.541
- Well, that's not entirely true...
- Well… Well… Well…

887
01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:29.166
Why is nothing simple with you, Poe?

888
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.666
Where are the facts?
Where are the simple facts?

889
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:34.083
Yes! Or no!

890
01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:36.625
The truth!

891
01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:43.083
- Did you know Leroy Fry?
- Yes.

892
01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:47.333
Did you have words with Leroy Fry?

893
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.208
Yes. Yes.

894
01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.291
Did you kill Leroy Fry?

895
01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:02.916
Did you kill Randolph Ballinger?

896
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.833
No.

897
01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:15.375
Did you have anything to do
with the desecrating of their bodies?

898
01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:18.916
- No, no, no. May I be struck dead if I...
- But you do not deny

899
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.791
that you threatened both men?

900
01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:25.125
Well, as it relates
to Ballinger, that was…

901
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:30.833
I never meant it.

902
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:35.750
- And Fry?
- I never once threatened him. I merely...

903
01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:41.000
There is
a very disturbing pattern here, Poe.

904
01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:46.791
Men who cross you
end up on the wrong end of a noose

905
01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:51.958
with rather important organs
carved from their chests.

906
01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:54.041
Mr. Landor…

907
01:13:57.791 --> 01:13:59.958
If I were to kill every cadet

908
01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:02.958
who had abused me
during my brief tenure here,

909
01:14:04.833 --> 01:14:08.041
I'm afraid you would find
the Corp of Cadets

910
01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:09.791
reduced to less than a dozen.

911
01:14:14.041 --> 01:14:17.250
Now, if you must know,
I've been a figure of fun

912
01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.833
from my very first day here.

913
01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:26.375
My manner, my age, my person…

914
01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:30.291
my aesthetics.

915
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:36.666
If I had a thousand lifetimes,

916
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:39.166
I could not begin
to address all the injuries

917
01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.583
that have been done to me.

918
01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:48.250
Yes, I am guilty of a great,
great many things, but never that.

919
01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:52.208
Never murder.

920
01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:56.875
Now do you believe me?

921
01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:06.166
I believe that you should take better care
of what you say and do.

922
01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:14.416
For now, I can probably
hold off Hitchcock.

923
01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:21.833
But if you ever lie to me again,

924
01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:27.250
they can clap you in irons
and I won't lift a finger to help you.

925
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:30.458
Do you understand me?

926
01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.333
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm expected for dinner.

927
01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:15.916
Thank you for joining us
in mourning Randolph's untimely passing.

928
01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.541
The dear boy was family.

929
01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:28.875
Don't you find my son
exceptionally handsome, Mr. Landor?

930
01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:33.333
Um…

931
01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:41.083
I would judge both of your children
to have been blessed in that regard.

932
01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:44.583
Yes, we are hereditarily blessed.

933
01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:50.000
But I must say, I do find you a rarity.

934
01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:54.458
A person of exceptional intelligence.

935
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.291
The quality in such
ridiculously short supply here.

936
01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.666
And with that intelligence,
Mr. Landor,

937
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.166
I hope when you're finished
with your official business,

938
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:10.541
you will assist me
with a puzzle of my own.

939
01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:13.916
- Oh, a puzzle?
- The strangest affair.

940
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.958
While in recital, Monday,

941
01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:20.416
it appears someone
had rifled through my belongings.

942
01:17:21.541 --> 01:17:23.250
- Oh.
- Well, eh…

943
01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:27.125
- Terrible people are abroad.
- Really, Father?

944
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.416
I was inclining toward the theory
that the fellow was simply rude,

945
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.166
while, of course,
having no idea who he was.

946
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:39.041
All the same,
you must be careful, Artemus.

947
01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:41.625
- You really must.
- Oh, Mother.

948
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.625
It was probably
just some tiresome old fellow

949
01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:50.208
with nothing better to do
and no life of his own to speak of.

950
01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:53.958
A rustic sort of cottager.

951
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.416
Don't you think, Mr. Landor?

952
01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.041
Oh.

953
01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:02.125
- You have a cottage, don't you?
- Artemus.

954
01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:06.208
You may even have some
very near relations who fit the pattern.

955
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:09.541
Perhaps a dear friend who likes
a tipple and to drink in a tavern.

956
01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:13.083
Stop it! Just, please! I hate it!

957
01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:16.000
I positively hate it
when you take on like this.

958
01:18:16.083 --> 01:18:18.750
- I don't follow your drift, Mother.
- Oh, no, I'm sure you don't.

959
01:18:18.833 --> 01:18:21.875
I might drift clear to the other side
of the Hudson and no one would care.

960
01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:23.583
No one would follow!

961
01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:26.458
- Would they, Daniel?
- Son, please.

962
01:18:36.416 --> 01:18:40.416
You'll… have to forgive my wife.

963
01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:45.250
Mr. Ballinger's death

964
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:50.291
has cast a pall
over our happy little clan.

965
01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:02.458
I wonder if you'd care
to join me in my study, Mr. Landor?

966
01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:03.541
I'd be delighted.

967
01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:14.250
My apologies, constable.

968
01:19:16.458 --> 01:19:20.791
Living on pins and needles
has taken its toll on all of us.

969
01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:23.041
- No need to apologize.
- Yeah.

970
01:19:23.833 --> 01:19:28.375
And the time of year,
all this confinement…

971
01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:31.791
Mmm. It is all very understandable.

972
01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:39.541
I couldn't help noticing, doctor.

973
01:19:42.166 --> 01:19:44.208
Is your daughter unwell?

974
01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:47.208
Quite observant.

975
01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:49.458
Yes.

976
01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:52.708
Yes, she's…

977
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:57.791
She's had a rough go of it, that one.

978
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.541
Since she was a pup, really.

979
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:06.583
A ghastly illness
seizing her when no one is looking,

980
01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:11.750
stopping her brain
and shaking her like a gourd.

981
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.291
Beautiful child.

982
01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:20.125
One marked for marriage, status, children.

983
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:25.583
And in the same stroke, illness.

984
01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:30.125
'Tis dreadful.

985
01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:37.000
Gentlemen, Lea is in fine form
if you'd join us.

986
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.208
Thank you, son.

987
01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:43.541
Shall we?

988
01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:48.250
If you don't mind,
I'll just step out for some fresh air.

989
01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:49.291
Of course.

990
01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:58.291
Father, have a game with me.

991
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.166
Shall I try the scholars again

992
01:21:03.958 --> 01:21:07.000
or something more challenging this time?

993
01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:08.166
- Just remarkable.
- Hardly.

994
01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.208
Passable, maybe.

995
01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:14.416
You don't realize the effect
your playing has on me.

996
01:23:16.166 --> 01:23:18.166
On all of us, really, I…

997
01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:23.208
- Yes?
- Well, I…

998
01:23:26.583 --> 01:23:33.333
I don't quite know how else to put it,
but, um… I've come to realize

999
01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:37.708
that I would do most anything for you.

1000
01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:45.958
Oh, Edgar.

1001
01:24:10.458 --> 01:24:13.500
May I help you
find something, Mr. Landor?

1002
01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:17.500
You've recovered. And so soon.

1003
01:24:18.458 --> 01:24:19.791
Well, do forgive me.

1004
01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:23.791
I feared I was coming down with
one of those horrid migraines,

1005
01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:28.333
but it seems a moment's rest
was all I required.

1006
01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:31.375
And I feel quite cured. Mmm.

1007
01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:37.708
Let's put that dreadful,
old thing away, shall we?

1008
01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:40.125
I'm quite sure it won't fit you.

1009
01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:44.333
The good doctor and I
were in search of it.

1010
01:24:45.125 --> 01:24:46.208
And I found it.

1011
01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:52.083
Look what the constable
found in our closet, darling.

1012
01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:58.083
Remember Artemus wearing it
as a young lad around the house?

1013
01:24:58.916 --> 01:25:00.208
Remember, love?

1014
01:25:00.291 --> 01:25:02.500
- I remember, Mother.
- It's my brother's coat.

1015
01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:03.833
Your brother's?

1016
01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:06.500
That's the only thing
we have to remember him by.

1017
01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:08.791
Why do you have it?

1018
01:25:08.875 --> 01:25:10.500
Perhaps Artemus can answer that.

1019
01:25:17.416 --> 01:25:19.041
Everyone is in the salon.

1020
01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:22.916
Ethan.

1021
01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:26.166
What brings you here?

1022
01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:28.875
Another cadet is missing.

1023
01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:35.250
And I've formed a search party
ready to go within the hour.

1024
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:37.458
No stone will be left unturned.

1025
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:39.583
God help us. I shudder to think...

1026
01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:40.500
Gentlemen!

1027
01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:43.375
I've just been to Mr. Stoddard's quarters.

1028
01:25:43.458 --> 01:25:48.166
His trunk was empty. No civilian clothes
were to be found anywhere.

1029
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.375
I believe he has run off.

1030
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:52.500
Run off?

1031
01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:54.750
Fry's diary allows

1032
01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:58.791
that both Stoddard and Ballinger
were good mates with Leroy Fry.

1033
01:25:58.875 --> 01:26:00.958
Fearing he might be next, I think he ran.

1034
01:26:01.041 --> 01:26:04.708
Well, that may well be, but what about
Artemus and the officer's coat?

1035
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:08.250
If he's involved, how can
we possibly delay arresting him?

1036
01:26:08.333 --> 01:26:13.208
He is… too cool a customer for that.
All he has to do is deny it.

1037
01:26:14.041 --> 01:26:17.291
Now, there's a last avenue
of inquiry I'm exploring.

1038
01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:19.750
Two of his closest companions are dead,

1039
01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:23.083
and imminently, I must report
to the president that we have our man.

1040
01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:27.333
We have our man, Landor. Do we not?

1041
01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:45.833
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

1042
01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:48.666
Edgar.

1043
01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:54.958
- I, uh…
<i>- Professor?</i>

1044
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Pépé?

1045
01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:05.875
Last time I was here,
you mentioned a witch hunter and a book.

1046
01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:08.791
Yes. <i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1047
01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:10.791
Henri Le Clerc.

1048
01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.166
Was Le Clerc a priest?

1049
01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:15.416
One burned at the stake.

1050
01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.208
<i>It came to me while I slept</i>

1051
01:27:23.791 --> 01:27:25.791
<i>Down, down, down</i>

1052
01:27:26.791 --> 01:27:30.000
<i>Came the hot threshing flurry</i>

1053
01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:34.791
<i>Ill at heart, I beseeched her to hurry</i>

1054
01:27:36.791 --> 01:27:37.958
<i>"Lenore"</i>

1055
01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:42.375
<i>She forbore the reply</i>

1056
01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:46.416
<i>Endless night
Caught her then in its slurry</i>

1057
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.666
<i>Shrouding all, but her pale blue eye</i>

1058
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.833
<i>Darkest night, black with hell</i>

1059
01:27:51.916 --> 01:27:53.500
<i>Charneled fury</i>

1060
01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:56.708
<i>Leaving only</i>

1061
01:27:58.041 --> 01:27:59.458
<i>That deathly blue eye</i>

1062
01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:07.416
Do you see?

1063
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.291
Lenore.

1064
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:13.833
Lea.

1065
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:18.625
It speaks of your unspeakable distress.

1066
01:28:20.166 --> 01:28:24.166
A conclusion to what's… oppressing you.

1067
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:25.666
The poem…

1068
01:28:28.958 --> 01:28:30.541
is speaking to us.

1069
01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:44.500
Remember when you said
you'd do anything for me?

1070
01:28:47.458 --> 01:28:48.791
Your devil worshipper.

1071
01:28:54.416 --> 01:28:56.250
- Thank you, Pépé.
- Yeah.

1072
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:10.583
Mr. Landor.

1073
01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.583
Your family.

1074
01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:20.333
Your family… have been

1075
01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:22.833
quite a puzzle.

1076
01:29:24.041 --> 01:29:29.041
I could never get a fix
of who was in command.

1077
01:29:29.833 --> 01:29:32.625
One time or other I suspected each of you.

1078
01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:34.750
It never occurred to me

1079
01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:40.250
that it might be someone
who wasn't even alive.

1080
01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:42.958
Pardon me?

1081
01:29:43.041 --> 01:29:46.875
Father Henri Le Clerc.

1082
01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:51.500
Finest of witch hunters,

1083
01:29:52.333 --> 01:29:55.083
until he became the hunted.

1084
01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.250
What are you talking about?

1085
01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:04.250
Your daughter, she suffers
from a falling sickness, does she not?

1086
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:08.291
She copes because
she is in contact with someone.

1087
01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:10.791
Someone who instructs her.

1088
01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:14.041
Him.

1089
01:30:14.916 --> 01:30:19.375
Do not make me question
your sanity, Mr. Landor.

1090
01:30:19.458 --> 01:30:21.666
Uh, what are you suggesting?

1091
01:30:27.041 --> 01:30:33.833
Le Clerc's incredibly rare
<i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1092
01:30:37.916 --> 01:30:42.500
Well, communicating with the devil

1093
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:47.083
is not a pastime
with which I am familiar, Mr. Landor.

1094
01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:50.958
I have never read a page of this book.

1095
01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:55.541
Does your daughter speak with the dead?!

1096
01:31:12.083 --> 01:31:16.000
Over the years, the seizures
have gotten much, much worse.

1097
01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:18.416
I…

1098
01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:25.083
I have tried
every medical regimen I could think of.

1099
01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:28.833
She was given three months to live.

1100
01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:32.125
Do you know
what it feels like to go to sleep,

1101
01:31:32.208 --> 01:31:35.208
not knowing if your daughter
will make it through the night?

1102
01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:39.625
But then, one day she came to me,

1103
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:44.583
and said that she'd met someone.

1104
01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.875
Her great-great-grandfather.

1105
01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:48.416
Le Clerc?

1106
01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:51.041
Henri Le Clerc wasn't evil.

1107
01:31:53.291 --> 01:31:55.333
He… He was misunderstood.

1108
01:32:48.583 --> 01:32:52.916
They swore to me Mr. Fry was already dead.

1109
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.083
They swore they could never kill anyone.

1110
01:32:55.166 --> 01:32:57.125
You believed them.

1111
01:32:57.208 --> 01:32:58.791
I had no choice.

1112
01:32:58.875 --> 01:33:01.791
You are a physician! A man of science!

1113
01:33:01.875 --> 01:33:05.125
How dare you
put your faith in such madness?

1114
01:33:05.208 --> 01:33:06.041
Because…

1115
01:33:07.083 --> 01:33:11.000
Because I… I… I couldn't save her myself.

1116
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:14.208
My own art had failed me.

1117
01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:19.500
I sacrificed everything for my Lea.

1118
01:33:20.125 --> 01:33:23.250
So how can I then object
to her finding a cure elsewhere?

1119
01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:24.291
Doctor.

1120
01:33:25.916 --> 01:33:27.750
Communicating with the dead…

1121
01:33:29.958 --> 01:33:32.333
that's not normal. But murder…

1122
01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.333
destroying innocent lives…

1123
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.750
that's inhuman.

1124
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.375
Someone has to hang for this.

1125
01:33:48.541 --> 01:33:54.083
I only indulged her because… miraculously,

1126
01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:57.041
she seemed to improve.

1127
01:33:58.250 --> 01:34:00.666
Doctor, where is your family?

1128
01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:03.875
Where are your children?

1129
01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:07.333
Mr. Poe was here earlier.

1130
01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:12.291
He left with… With Artemus.

1131
01:34:13.125 --> 01:34:15.875
Why is his cloak still in the hall?

1132
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.791
Doctor, where is Lea?

1133
01:34:20.625 --> 01:34:22.625
Doctor, where is your family?

1134
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:31.125
It's starting to wear off.

1135
01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:33.333
Lea.

1136
01:34:36.833 --> 01:34:38.041
Continue.

1137
01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:06.250
What's happening?

1138
01:35:09.583 --> 01:35:11.000
It won't be much longer.

1139
01:35:11.083 --> 01:35:14.208
I don't feel terribly well.

1140
01:35:16.875 --> 01:35:19.875
- I thought…
- No.

1141
01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:25.625
Just a few minutes more and I'll be free.

1142
01:35:29.375 --> 01:35:30.541
Free?

1143
01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:31.625
Yes.

1144
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:35.500
Please, Lea. I'm…

1145
01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:39.041
This must happen.

1146
01:35:40.666 --> 01:35:41.916
You do understand.

1147
01:35:42.833 --> 01:35:46.375
Sacrifice is
the ultimate expression of love.

1148
01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:51.833
I knew from the moment I met you,
you were the one.

1149
01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:54.791
Lea.

1150
01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:57.791
- Yes?
- I do love you.

1151
01:36:27.166 --> 01:36:28.666
Artemus…

1152
01:36:30.625 --> 01:36:31.791
Enough!

1153
01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:39.541
- Get out!
- You'll hang for this!

1154
01:36:39.625 --> 01:36:41.708
- You've no business here!
- Lea, finish!

1155
01:36:41.791 --> 01:36:44.750
Mrs. Marquis, do you
wish to see your children hang?

1156
01:36:44.833 --> 01:36:47.208
- Don't listen. He's bluffing!
- Continue.

1157
01:36:47.291 --> 01:36:49.750
- Lea!
- That's Fry's heart, no?

1158
01:36:49.833 --> 01:36:51.708
- Landor.
- Lea, continue!

1159
01:36:51.791 --> 01:36:54.791
Ballinger, he'd do anything for you,
even murder a man.

1160
01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.333
And, Artemus, you killed him.

1161
01:36:56.416 --> 01:36:58.666
Please, just leave us alone.
It's almost done.

1162
01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:00.958
- Lea, finish!
- Lea, it is done!

1163
01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:02.791
It was you.

1164
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.375
It was you who lured Fry out with a note...

1165
01:37:06.458 --> 01:37:08.083
It wasn't her idea! It was mine!

1166
01:37:08.166 --> 01:37:09.791
- I did it!
- No! Artemus!

1167
01:37:09.875 --> 01:37:11.333
No!

1168
01:37:11.416 --> 01:37:12.791
Stop!

1169
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:17.750
Stop!

1170
01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:20.333
Lea!

1171
01:37:46.208 --> 01:37:47.041
Lea!

1172
01:37:47.125 --> 01:37:49.166
- Lea! Lea!
- Lea!

1173
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:54.958
Artemus. Artemus, help her.
Help her!

1174
01:37:59.708 --> 01:38:01.125
Mother, stay back!

1175
01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:02.375
Artemus.

1176
01:38:02.458 --> 01:38:05.041
Lea. Lea! Lea!

1177
01:38:06.083 --> 01:38:08.500
Artemus! Artemus!

1178
01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:11.208
- I can't leave her!
- No!

1179
01:38:11.291 --> 01:38:15.500
Artemus, no. Artemus!

1180
01:38:15.583 --> 01:38:17.166
Artemus! No!

1181
01:38:21.416 --> 01:38:24.375
Let me go! No!

1182
01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.250
No, Artemus!

1183
01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:43.458
Artemus! No!

1184
01:38:44.875 --> 01:38:47.458
Lea! Lea!

1185
01:38:47.541 --> 01:38:49.375
No!

1186
01:38:49.458 --> 01:38:51.416
No!

1187
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.500
Move!

1188
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.291
I'm told he's lost no more blood
than a physician would have drawn

1189
01:39:43.375 --> 01:39:45.125
in the course of a normal bleeding.

1190
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.250
Might have been the best thing for him.

1191
01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:54.166
More to life than meets the eye,
Landor, I admit.

1192
01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:56.625
I couldn't agree more.

1193
01:39:58.083 --> 01:40:01.000
So what now of Mrs. Marquis?

1194
01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:04.791
Grieving as only a mother can.

1195
01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:08.041
The magistrate felt she'd suffered enough.

1196
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.500
But you'll be pleased to know

1197
01:40:11.583 --> 01:40:15.333
our good doctor
has submitted his resignation.

1198
01:40:16.958 --> 01:40:21.541
None of this pleases me, I can assure you.

1199
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:25.750
Landor.

1200
01:40:33.208 --> 01:40:38.375
You and I could not be more dissimilar
in manner, philosophy.

1201
01:40:41.458 --> 01:40:43.208
But I wish to convey

1202
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:46.416
that if this business
has ever rendered me…

1203
01:40:49.375 --> 01:40:54.750
Which is to say, if ever out
of impertinence, I have impugned…

1204
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:58.375
your competence…

1205
01:41:00.916 --> 01:41:02.000
then I'm sorry.

1206
01:41:05.166 --> 01:41:06.208
Thank you, captain.

1207
01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:21.125
How could I have dined and fraternized
with the man all of these years?

1208
01:41:22.166 --> 01:41:24.625
Known his family almost as well as my own

1209
01:41:24.708 --> 01:41:27.125
and never fathomed
the depths of their distress.

1210
01:41:28.125 --> 01:41:29.791
By design, colonel.

1211
01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:32.041
Yes.

1212
01:41:33.458 --> 01:41:36.833
Yes, I suppose shame on me.

1213
01:41:39.125 --> 01:41:42.500
I can only assume
Artemus murdered Mr. Ballinger

1214
01:41:42.583 --> 01:41:44.875
to prevent him
from alerting the authorities,

1215
01:41:44.958 --> 01:41:48.916
and Mr. Stoddard ran
rather than become the next victim.

1216
01:41:49.625 --> 01:41:51.125
You can assume that, yes.

1217
01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:54.666
Well, Landor,

1218
01:41:57.416 --> 01:42:01.041
I declare your contractual duties
fulfilled to the letter.

1219
01:42:01.875 --> 01:42:04.083
I hereby release you from your contract.

1220
01:42:05.666 --> 01:42:07.375
I hope that won't displease you.

1221
01:42:07.458 --> 01:42:11.625
At the very least, I hope
you won't object to accepting our thanks.

1222
01:42:14.666 --> 01:42:20.375
The jackals in Washington
will soon be in retreat, I hope.

1223
01:42:21.125 --> 01:42:24.125
I believe we have won a stay of execution.

1224
01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:26.750
No. Colonel.

1225
01:42:59.916 --> 01:43:01.833
Don't you look fully recovered.

1226
01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:11.458
I know about your daughter.

1227
01:43:15.916 --> 01:43:17.250
Very well.

1228
01:43:18.916 --> 01:43:21.500
What does Mattie have to do with anything?

1229
01:43:21.583 --> 01:43:22.541
Everything.

1230
01:43:23.875 --> 01:43:25.333
As you know full well.

1231
01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.000
It came to me while I slept.

1232
01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:20.750
The note… found in Leroy Fry's hand.

1233
01:44:21.375 --> 01:44:25.166
The note left for him
luring the poor bloke from his barracks.

1234
01:44:27.208 --> 01:44:29.541
You were careless enough
to leave that with me.

1235
01:44:38.791 --> 01:44:41.041
This is the other note you left.

1236
01:44:43.666 --> 01:44:44.791
<i>Remember?</i>

1237
01:44:49.166 --> 01:44:50.166
<i>I'm most</i>

1238
01:44:51.541 --> 01:44:53.750
struck by the shape of your characters.

1239
01:44:54.708 --> 01:44:58.125
Uppercase, as you well know,
are every bit as damning as lowercase.

1240
01:44:58.208 --> 01:45:01.125
The A, the R, the G and the E,

1241
01:45:01.208 --> 01:45:05.708
virtually identical to the ones
found in Leroy Fry's note.

1242
01:45:07.416 --> 01:45:11.625
You can imagine my astonishment.

1243
01:45:13.833 --> 01:45:17.416
Could the same man
have written both notes?

1244
01:45:18.875 --> 01:45:23.791
And why would Landor have
any reason to correspond with Leroy Fry?

1245
01:45:26.416 --> 01:45:30.875
As luck would have it,
I ran into <i>la</i> divine Patsy.

1246
01:45:34.625 --> 01:45:36.041
His daughter Mattie…

1247
01:45:36.125 --> 01:45:37.833
<i>She told me the whole story.</i>

1248
01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:41.833
<i>Returning home from the Academy Ball…</i>

1249
01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.166
Grab her!

1250
01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:45.458
- Hold her.
- No!

1251
01:45:45.541 --> 01:45:47.041
<i>…your Mattie was raped…</i>

1252
01:45:47.583 --> 01:45:48.833
No!

1253
01:45:48.916 --> 01:45:51.500
<i>…and left for dead
by three nameless ruffians.</i>

1254
01:45:51.583 --> 01:45:52.500
Quiet.

1255
01:45:53.375 --> 01:45:55.958
- Please, no! No!
- Julius, grab her legs!

1256
01:45:56.041 --> 01:45:58.416
- No! No, no, no!
- Grab her!

1257
01:45:59.583 --> 01:46:01.708
- Legs! Legs! Hold her down!
- No!

1258
01:46:01.791 --> 01:46:03.583
- Keep her still.
- Please!

1259
01:46:03.666 --> 01:46:05.333
<i>A bad bunch, indeed.</i>

1260
01:46:05.416 --> 01:46:06.250
Mattie.

1261
01:46:06.791 --> 01:46:08.375
<i>Just as Leroy Fry had said.</i>

1262
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:11.250
Mattie?

1263
01:46:12.250 --> 01:46:14.333
Oh, God! Mattie.

1264
01:46:14.416 --> 01:46:16.500
Oh, my God! Come here.

1265
01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:22.375
Mattie.

1266
01:46:23.458 --> 01:46:24.916
I'm sorry.

1267
01:46:27.458 --> 01:46:29.041
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1268
01:46:29.791 --> 01:46:32.625
Everything will be all right.

1269
01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:36.125
It'll all turn out.

1270
01:47:11.708 --> 01:47:13.916
Mattie, he cannot help you.

1271
01:47:15.625 --> 01:47:18.041
Please, my love. Let me help you.

1272
01:47:25.125 --> 01:47:29.250
But she didn't run away, did she?

1273
01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:44.291
Mattie?

1274
01:47:49.708 --> 01:47:50.541
Mattie.

1275
01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:58.541
Mattie.

1276
01:48:06.833 --> 01:48:09.416
Mattie, please. Come here.

1277
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:16.250
Please, my love. Come here.
Please come here.

1278
01:48:16.916 --> 01:48:18.041
Don't.

1279
01:48:18.125 --> 01:48:19.791
Everything will be all right.

1280
01:48:21.583 --> 01:48:23.375
Please, Mattie. Come back.

1281
01:48:24.666 --> 01:48:25.916
It'll all turn out.

1282
01:48:29.375 --> 01:48:30.208
Don't.

1283
01:48:31.541 --> 01:48:32.541
I love you.

1284
01:48:55.041 --> 01:48:56.458
Why did you never tell me?

1285
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:59.375
It's not a story

1286
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:02.291
I enjoy telling.

1287
01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:07.666
But I would have comforted you.

1288
01:49:09.666 --> 01:49:12.916
Helped you as you helped me.

1289
01:49:17.875 --> 01:49:22.958
I don't think I can
be comforted on that particular subject.

1290
01:49:29.416 --> 01:49:32.375
So what did I do next?

1291
01:49:34.125 --> 01:49:37.291
Exactly what you would have done.

1292
01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:40.541
Examined all assumptions, beginning with

1293
01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.083
what were the chances that two parties

1294
01:49:44.166 --> 01:49:48.750
would have had designs
on the same cadet in the same evening?

1295
01:49:48.833 --> 01:49:49.708
Small!

1296
01:49:50.791 --> 01:49:52.041
Small indeed!

1297
01:49:53.916 --> 01:49:58.958
Unless we see one party
as being contingent upon the other,

1298
01:49:59.041 --> 01:50:02.041
or what if one party say, Artemus and Lea,

1299
01:50:02.125 --> 01:50:05.875
what if they were simply
on the lookout for a dead body.

1300
01:50:05.958 --> 01:50:08.125
And then the opportunity
magically appears,

1301
01:50:08.208 --> 01:50:11.958
and they don't care who the body is,
provided it had a heart.

1302
01:50:12.041 --> 01:50:15.208
The one thing
they won't do for it is kill.

1303
01:50:15.291 --> 01:50:19.416
No, it is the other party
who is ready and willing to kill.

1304
01:50:21.458 --> 01:50:23.708
And to kill this man in particular.

1305
01:50:23.791 --> 01:50:25.333
Why? Why?

1306
01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:35.166
Might it be revenge, Landor?

1307
01:50:50.583 --> 01:50:53.416
Patsy? Patsy?

1308
01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:07.583
- Help!
- Who was with you?

1309
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:35.291
Someone there?

1310
01:51:41.333 --> 01:51:42.166
Hello?

1311
01:52:08.916 --> 01:52:13.166
<i>So… the second party is interrupted,</i>

1312
01:52:14.916 --> 01:52:17.541
<i>though not before
his successful resolution.</i>

1313
01:52:19.458 --> 01:52:22.125
<i>Steals back to his cottage
in Buttermilk Falls,</i>

1314
01:52:23.708 --> 01:52:25.291
where he has escaped unnoticed.

1315
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.291
But he's shocked at being summoned back
to West Point the very next day

1316
01:52:32.583 --> 01:52:35.333
to learn that in the intervening hours,

1317
01:52:35.416 --> 01:52:38.916
the dead man's body
has been most horribly mutilated.

1318
01:52:39.625 --> 01:52:43.541
Thus providing his crimes
with an extraordinary cover.

1319
01:52:43.625 --> 01:52:44.458
Hmm.

1320
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.833
He must think God himself was on his side.

1321
01:52:50.291 --> 01:52:54.833
Being engaged to solve
the very crimes that he himself committed.

1322
01:52:57.208 --> 01:53:03.166
And as a result, Artemus and Lea
will forever go down as murderers.

1323
01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:06.416
Ah… There's no forever about it.

1324
01:53:07.208 --> 01:53:10.916
They will be forgotten
just like the rest of us.

1325
01:53:11.541 --> 01:53:14.041
I shall not forget them!

1326
01:53:16.166 --> 01:53:17.875
Especially my Lea.

1327
01:53:20.541 --> 01:53:23.625
She was to be a wife, Landor, a mother.

1328
01:53:27.875 --> 01:53:31.166
Nor shall I forget how you
played the rest of us as fools.

1329
01:53:32.791 --> 01:53:33.791
Fools.

1330
01:53:37.583 --> 01:53:39.291
But I was your prize fool.

1331
01:53:41.291 --> 01:53:43.291
- Was I not?
- No.

1332
01:53:49.458 --> 01:53:53.333
You were the one who I was
to deliver myself to all along.

1333
01:53:53.416 --> 01:53:57.625
I knew that from the moment
I first met you, and here we are.

1334
01:54:03.791 --> 01:54:04.958
I, uh…

1335
01:54:08.625 --> 01:54:11.166
If you want me to say I'm sorry, I will.

1336
01:54:13.083 --> 01:54:14.583
I don't want your apologies.

1337
01:54:16.541 --> 01:54:19.291
No. I want answers.

1338
01:54:21.416 --> 01:54:24.291
How did you know
it was Fry who raped Mattie?

1339
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.416
The sheep and the cows, your doing?

1340
01:54:36.708 --> 01:54:39.041
- Of course.
- And Ballinger?

1341
01:54:39.541 --> 01:54:40.708
Mmm-hmm.

1342
01:54:43.333 --> 01:54:44.958
Ballinger.

1343
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:47.333
I had to cut his heart out.

1344
01:54:48.541 --> 01:54:50.875
Had to make it look
like the work of satanists.

1345
01:54:50.958 --> 01:54:53.333
That is no easy job for an old man.

1346
01:54:55.125 --> 01:54:57.791
How did you learn
of Ballinger's involvement?

1347
01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:02.041
Fry's diary.

1348
01:55:05.166 --> 01:55:07.083
Did Ballinger confess as well?

1349
01:55:07.166 --> 01:55:10.500
- Oh, yes, under duress.
<i>- No, please!</i>

1350
01:55:12.083 --> 01:55:14.333
Who else was with you?!

1351
01:55:14.416 --> 01:55:15.625
Julius Stoddard.

1352
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:18.833
Julius.

1353
01:55:21.041 --> 01:55:21.958
Sorry.

1354
01:55:24.333 --> 01:55:25.333
They both…

1355
01:55:28.458 --> 01:55:30.250
They both recalled her name,

1356
01:55:31.541 --> 01:55:35.958
and I made certain
that he recalled what she was wearing.

1357
01:55:36.791 --> 01:55:39.250
Every detail of her dress.

1358
01:55:39.958 --> 01:55:43.458
Only Stoddard, it seems,
has escaped your justice.

1359
01:55:44.083 --> 01:55:50.541
I haven't… the strength
or the will to chase him down.

1360
01:55:50.625 --> 01:55:51.750
I only hope…

1361
01:55:54.833 --> 01:56:00.583
that he spends the rest of his…
miserable life looking over his shoulder.

1362
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:08.333
What they did
was an appalling, savage thing.

1363
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:13.333
But you might have gone straight
to Thayer, secured a confession.

1364
01:56:13.416 --> 01:56:15.125
I didn't want them to confess.

1365
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:21.250
I wanted them to die.

1366
01:56:31.916 --> 01:56:33.041
And so what now?

1367
01:56:35.791 --> 01:56:36.666
What now?

1368
01:56:38.333 --> 01:56:39.583
That depends on you.

1369
01:56:49.666 --> 01:56:51.750
I have a pair of notes…

1370
01:56:54.041 --> 01:56:55.958
that will send you to the gallows.

1371
01:57:19.041 --> 01:57:20.083
Very well.

1372
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:21.625
You know, Edgar, I often wish

1373
01:58:22.916 --> 01:58:25.916
that my Mattie had run into you

1374
01:58:27.583 --> 01:58:31.250
that night… of the ball.

1375
01:58:34.041 --> 01:58:35.041
Who knows?

1376
01:58:42.708 --> 01:58:44.583
We might have become a family indeed.

1377
01:58:52.333 --> 01:58:53.750
I sure treasure…

1378
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:05.250
…what… What we, um…

1379
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.166
Goodbye, Landor.

1380
02:00:36.333 --> 02:00:37.791
Rest, my love.
