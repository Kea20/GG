00:00:01.712 --> 00:00:03.211
(mysterious music)

2
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:19.227
(heavy breathing)

3
00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:20.562
(tapping)

4
00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:25.975
(sighing)

5
00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:28.070
(dark music)

6
00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:34.802
(clattering)

7
00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:20.680
(door opening)

8
00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:21.364
- Federal agents, freeze!

9
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:22.515
Don't touch that gun,

10
00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:23.534
Don't touch it!

11
00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:27.832
(woman): What is
this, what's going on?

12
00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:29.000
- Federal agents, freeze!

13
00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:30.224
(man): Do you see me moving?

14
00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.836
- Cuff him.
- Lorenzo, lorenzo!

15
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.209
- Cuff him.

16
00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:34.636
(groaning)

17
00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.656
(eerie music)

18
00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:07.653
- What's this?

19
00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:09.754
- Your new life.

20
00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:22.642
- Teresa matheson.

21
00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:26.021
- Sign here.

22
00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:35.052
- You really think
you can protect me?

23
00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:36.894
- Haven't lost one yet.

24
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.796
(soft music)

25
00:03:05.454 --> 00:03:06.454
(sighs)

26
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.224
- Well...

27
00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:23.662
It's not much,
elena, but it's home.

28
00:03:42.157 --> 00:03:44.491
<i>- Hello?</i>

29
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:45.725
<i>Hello?</i>

30
00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:49.020
<i>Teresa, is that you?</i>

31
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.694
(exhaling)

32
00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:13.295
- We got this, right?

33
00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.466
Hey, just you and me.

34
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:21.428
(soft music)

35
00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:37.319
- Mom, I'm home.

36
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:44.159
Mom?

37
00:04:57.415 --> 00:04:58.673
Mom?

38
00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:07.849
Mom?

39
00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:08.925
(gasping)

40
00:05:09.077 --> 00:05:11.928
- Elena, I didn't
hear you come in.

41
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.746
- Are we going somewhere?

42
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.343
- Uh... Actually, I
need to talk to you.

43
00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:21.483
Let's go sit, dinner
should be ready soon.

44
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:35.668
- You said you wanted to talk.

45
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:41.941
- I have to go away
for a few days.

46
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.438
You'll be alright on
your own, won't you?

47
00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:46.054
- Sure but what's going on?

48
00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:47.321
Where are you going?

49
00:05:48.283 --> 00:05:50.207
- I have to go home,

50
00:05:50.227 --> 00:05:51.393
Back where I grew up.

51
00:05:54.472 --> 00:06:00.050
Your grandmother
in the hospital.

52
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.960
- Wait, what?

53
00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.311
- She's very sick

54
00:06:02.406 --> 00:06:04.647
And may not have much longer.

55
00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:07.984
- You mean grandma sofia, did
she die like a long time ago

56
00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:09.078
Before I was born?

57
00:06:09.988 --> 00:06:11.039
- That's what I told you.

58
00:06:11.063 --> 00:06:12.805
- So my grandmother's
still alive.

59
00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:15.144
- I thought I was doing the
right thing at the time.

60
00:06:15.234 --> 00:06:16.918
- What, why?

61
00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:19.838
- I'm sorry I lied, but
I wanted to protect you.

62
00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.229
- To protect me from
my own grandmother?

63
00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:26.221
- It's more
complicated than that.

64
00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:27.670
- Complicated how?

65
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.134
Okay, well, why can't
you explain it to me?

66
00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:31.278
Just tell me the truth.

67
00:06:32.844 --> 00:06:35.586
- You have a right to know the
truth, but not now, not yet.

68
00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:36.605
- Why?

69
00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:40.884
- I need to finish packing.

70
00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:42.777
- When do you leave?

71
00:06:43.447 --> 00:06:44.779
- Early tomorrow.

72
00:06:46.174 --> 00:06:48.450
I'll be gone and back
before you know it.

73
00:06:48.677 --> 00:06:50.243
(soft music)

74
00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:09.545
- Have a good trip, I guess.

75
00:07:09.698 --> 00:07:10.972
- Bye, baby.

76
00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:13.141
- Bye, mom.

77
00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:16.394
(suitcase rolling)

78
00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:18.539
- Bye.

79
00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:30.992
(sinister music)

80
00:07:40.486 --> 00:07:42.061
(man): I have to remind
you, this trip goes against

81
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.649
The advice of the
federal marshall service.

82
00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:45.155
- I am well aware.

83
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.233
- Do you know that we can't
guarantee your protection once

84
00:07:47.252 --> 00:07:48.713
You leave here, you'll
be giving up your cover.

85
00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:49.569
- I know the risks.

86
00:07:49.662 --> 00:07:51.542
They play in my head on a loop.

87
00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:54.622
You know, there's some things
in life you just have to do.

88
00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:55.863
I owe this to my mother.

89
00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:57.145
- Your mother wouldn't want you

90
00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:58.409
To risk your life to see her.

91
00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:02.315
Teresa, don't do this.

92
00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:08.490
- If anything should
happen to me...

93
00:08:08.514 --> 00:08:10.554
- Your daughter will
be taken care of.

94
00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:28.383
(doors closing)

95
00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:33.946
(suspenseful music)

96
00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:34.965
(gasping)

97
00:08:44.642 --> 00:08:46.317
(distant yelling)

98
00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.296
(dog barking)

99
00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:51.906
(eerie music)

100
00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:56.703
(distant sirens)

101
00:08:57.897 --> 00:08:59.247
(door closing)

102
00:09:00.491 --> 00:09:01.749
(engine starting)

103
00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:04.335
(clattering)

104
00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:18.767
(car beeping)

105
00:09:24.349 --> 00:09:25.732
(keys jingling)

106
00:09:27.593 --> 00:09:28.593
(distant scream)

107
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:35.950
(choking)

108
00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:52.216
(sinister music)

109
00:10:12.897 --> 00:10:14.875
<i>(phone): Hi, you've reached
teresa, please leave a message</i>

110
00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:15.882
<i>And I'll get right back to you.</i>

111
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.883
(voice mail tone)

112
00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:17.901
- Mom, it's me.

113
00:10:17.994 --> 00:10:19.327
I haven't heard from you

114
00:10:19.554 --> 00:10:20.714
And I'm starting to
get really worried,

115
00:10:20.738 --> 00:10:21.778
Please call me back.

116
00:10:23.074 --> 00:10:24.074
(sighing)

117
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.002
(suspenseful music)

118
00:10:34.326 --> 00:10:35.009
(knocking)

119
00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:36.236
(gasping)

120
00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:45.687
Who are you?

121
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.857
- Grant carter, us marshals
service, can I come in?

122
00:10:55.924 --> 00:10:57.089
- I saw you before.

123
00:10:57.775 --> 00:10:59.655
What do you want with my mom?

124
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.036
Is she in trouble?

125
00:11:02.688 --> 00:11:04.591
- I'm actually here
to talk to you.

126
00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:07.099
It's about your mother
but it would be better

127
00:11:07.118 --> 00:11:07.950
If I could come inside.

128
00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:08.710
You can keep

129
00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:10.021
The door open if you want.

130
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:14.441
- Okay.

131
00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:26.394
I was about to make some
coffee, do you want some?

132
00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:28.229
- Sure. Thanks.

133
00:11:30.808 --> 00:11:32.808
- So, you said
you're a us marshal?

134
00:11:33.478 --> 00:11:34.569
- That's right.

135
00:11:42.228 --> 00:11:43.228
- So what is it?

136
00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:45.972
- It's about your mother.

137
00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:47.305
- Yeah, you already said that.

138
00:11:49.252 --> 00:11:50.585
Did something happen?

139
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.680
- She was found last night.

140
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.040
Authorities are saying
it's a homicide.

141
00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:02.054
- What?

142
00:12:02.991 --> 00:12:03.991
- I'm sorry.

143
00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:12.356
- She's dead?

144
00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:14.903
- Someone found
her at the hospital

145
00:12:14.927 --> 00:12:16.647
After she had visited
your grandmother.

146
00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:18.905
She had asphyxiated.

147
00:12:21.692 --> 00:12:23.692
- How could someone
do that to her?

148
00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:27.825
- Look, I know this is a
shock, do you want to sit?

149
00:12:27.849 --> 00:12:29.957
(whimpering)

150
00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:35.577
I don't know how much she
told you about her past

151
00:12:35.614 --> 00:12:37.814
And her involvement with
the marshal's office.

152
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:41.527
- Her what?

153
00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.137
I...

154
00:12:45.642 --> 00:12:46.974
I can't.

155
00:12:48.719 --> 00:12:50.719
I don't want to
hear this right now.

156
00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:52.647
- This affects you too.

157
00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:56.108
- My mom is gone.

158
00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:00.238
I don't care about
anything else.

159
00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:08.162
- For when you're ready to talk.

160
00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:12.333
- Please just go.

161
00:13:18.675 --> 00:13:19.799
Get out.

162
00:13:23.012 --> 00:13:24.846
(crying)

163
00:14:00.108 --> 00:14:02.383
(soft music)

164
00:14:05.537 --> 00:14:07.972
How could you leave
me like this, mom?

165
00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:12.393
I still need you.

166
00:14:12.896 --> 00:14:16.397
(heavy breathing)

167
00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:31.412
Russo? What is this?

168
00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:26.358
Four valley plain teens were
involved in a two-car accident

169
00:15:26.377 --> 00:15:30.546
On Friday leaving one passenger
dead and another paralyzed.

170
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:35.050
Track star teresa russo was
hospitalized with several broken

171
00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:38.015
Bones while her friend
jacqueline armstrong was admitted

172
00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:40.731
With a concussion and
severe facial lacerations.

173
00:15:42.968 --> 00:15:44.110
Teresa russo?

174
00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:18.352
(suspenseful music)

175
00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:20.521
(rattling)

176
00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:27.587
(panting)

177
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.031
(eerie music)

178
00:16:43.604 --> 00:16:45.212
(panting)

179
00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:48.215
(banging)

180
00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:49.793
(whimpering)

181
00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:50.793
Look, if you don't leave,

182
00:16:50.887 --> 00:16:52.007
I'm gonna call the cops.

183
00:16:54.282 --> 00:16:56.223
(whimpering)

184
00:17:22.143 --> 00:17:23.642
(banging)

185
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:25.753
(panting)

186
00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:38.766
<i>(man): Elena?</i>

187
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:41.638
- Someone's outside of my door
trying to break into my house.

188
00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:42.828
<i>- Find a place to
stay out of sight,</i>

189
00:17:42.847 --> 00:17:44.438
<i>I'll be there in less than ten.</i>

190
00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:45.439
- Okay.

191
00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:47.441
(whimpering)

192
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.613
(knocking)

193
00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:10.799
- It's carter!

194
00:18:10.949 --> 00:18:12.049
(knocking)

195
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:16.069
- Did you see them?

196
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:19.865
- I checked the
whole neighbourhood.

197
00:18:19.884 --> 00:18:21.216
- Well, someone was here.

198
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.626
- I believe you and I take all

199
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.920
Potential threats seriously.

200
00:18:24.722 --> 00:18:26.850
We'll see what your neighbour's
cameras can tell us.

201
00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:28.056
- It's weird, right?

202
00:18:28.209 --> 00:18:29.224
The timing.

203
00:18:29.377 --> 00:18:30.225
- Could be a regular robbery

204
00:18:30.378 --> 00:18:31.635
Attempt or it could have

205
00:18:31.654 --> 00:18:32.894
Something to do with your mom.

206
00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:34.823
- How?

207
00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:38.971
- I guess teresa didn't mention
the witness protection program.

208
00:18:38.995 --> 00:18:41.387
- Mom was in the witness
protection program?

209
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.498
- She was. So were you,
by default. Until now.

210
00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:47.626
- Until she died you mean.

211
00:18:49.821 --> 00:18:51.316
- Someone very dangerous
has been after your mom

212
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.822
For the past 21 years.

213
00:18:52.842 --> 00:18:55.092
Last week when she
went to her hometown...

214
00:18:56.237 --> 00:18:58.237
- They found her
and they killed her.

215
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.000
- So... So, you know who
did it, you can arrest them.

216
00:19:04.094 --> 00:19:06.406
- Possible leads, but we need
something concrete to be able

217
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.470
To bring our case
to the us attorney.

218
00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:12.584
Elena, I'm concerned about
your safety, especially after

219
00:19:12.603 --> 00:19:13.435
Everything that happened today.

220
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:14.753
I think we should find

221
00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:15.771
A place for you to move to.

222
00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:16.922
- What?

223
00:19:16.941 --> 00:19:17.698
What? No.

224
00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:19.015
I...

225
00:19:19.035 --> 00:19:20.183
I just lost my mom, this place

226
00:19:20.203 --> 00:19:21.944
Is the only thing I have left.

227
00:19:22.038 --> 00:19:23.929
- Please consider this.
When you're ready,

228
00:19:23.948 --> 00:19:25.667
We can set you up
with a new identity.

229
00:19:25.691 --> 00:19:27.166
- Like you did for my mom?

230
00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:29.710
Didn't work out so well for her.

231
00:19:34.124 --> 00:19:35.124
(sighing)

232
00:19:36.794 --> 00:19:39.445
- Alright, keep the door bolted
shut, make sure the windows

233
00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:41.447
Are all locked,
don't let anyone in.

234
00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:42.539
- You're leaving?

235
00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:43.799
- I have to. I'm sorry.

236
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.392
- But I have more questions.

237
00:19:48.472 --> 00:19:49.632
- Do you know arbor park?

238
00:19:50.716 --> 00:19:52.916
Why don't you meet me
there at noon tomorrow?

239
00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:55.439
I'll bring your mother's file
and I'll post a car out front

240
00:19:55.463 --> 00:19:56.663
To watch the house tonight.

241
00:19:57.573 --> 00:19:58.647
- I'll be there.

242
00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.366
(suspenseful music)

243
00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:34.441
- Uh, you got
ketchup on your tie.

244
00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:36.092
- Ah, shoot.

245
00:20:36.112 --> 00:20:37.403
Uh...

246
00:20:39.949 --> 00:20:40.949
Um...

247
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:44.101
As promised,

248
00:20:45.346 --> 00:20:47.788
Copy of your mother's
witness protection file.

249
00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:52.639
- There's not much here.

250
00:20:53.037 --> 00:20:54.277
- Yeah.

251
00:20:54.297 --> 00:20:55.999
Because her case is still open,

252
00:20:56.023 --> 00:20:57.983
Some of the files
are classified.

253
00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:01.734
- What about my dad?

254
00:21:02.638 --> 00:21:03.638
Is he in here?

255
00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:13.897
Lorenzo bruno.

256
00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:16.709
This is him?

257
00:21:17.653 --> 00:21:18.653
- Yes.

258
00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:25.758
- Is there a photo?

259
00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:33.834
Is that him with my mom?

260
00:21:36.172 --> 00:21:39.414
Wait, are you telling
me that my mom entered

261
00:21:39.567 --> 00:21:42.492
Witness protection because she
testified against my father?

262
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:44.327
- They were dating at the time.

263
00:21:44.347 --> 00:21:46.267
By all accounts,
he was volatile.

264
00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:48.832
Your mom did a brave thing
by testifying against him.

265
00:21:48.926 --> 00:21:51.352
Not a good guy, at
least back then.

266
00:21:51.503 --> 00:21:53.743
He was caught up with a
lot of dangerous people.

267
00:21:54.172 --> 00:21:55.338
- And now?

268
00:21:55.358 --> 00:21:56.915
- He's allegedly cleaned himself

269
00:21:56.934 --> 00:21:58.417
Up over the last several years.

270
00:21:58.435 --> 00:22:01.028
Who knows, maybe he's finally
straightened out his life.

271
00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:03.876
- So he's out of prison?

272
00:22:05.275 --> 00:22:07.475
Do you think he's the
one that killed my mom?

273
00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:09.462
- He's on the suspect list.

274
00:22:09.947 --> 00:22:11.279
- Along with who?

275
00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:12.512
- The other defendant.

276
00:22:13.617 --> 00:22:14.875
Here's a photo.

277
00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:18.545
Frank stefano,

278
00:22:18.772 --> 00:22:20.772
Notorious kingpin of
the criminal operation

279
00:22:20.791 --> 00:22:22.831
He and lorenzo were
running back then.

280
00:22:22.868 --> 00:22:24.051
- He looks mean.

281
00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:26.612
- Your mom helped
put him away too.

282
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:28.614
- Damn, mom.

283
00:22:28.632 --> 00:22:30.685
- Yeah, he's still doing
time, but he has other that'll

284
00:22:30.709 --> 00:22:31.892
Do his dirty work for him.

285
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.580
- Have you talked
to any of them?

286
00:22:35.305 --> 00:22:37.505
- Like I said before,
we're working all leads.

287
00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:41.267
It's not always straight forward,
my team faces a lot of red tape.

288
00:22:43.406 --> 00:22:46.490
Have you given any more
thought to my offer?

289
00:22:49.578 --> 00:22:50.744
- Sorry.

290
00:22:53.398 --> 00:22:54.998
I can't do this right now.

291
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.430
- I put a form in there.

292
00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:00.892
Take a look at it
whenever you're ready.

293
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.460
All you'd have to do is
just sign if you decide

294
00:23:03.484 --> 00:23:04.684
You want to take the offer.

295
00:23:23.837 --> 00:23:25.612
(suspenseful music)

296
00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:29.301
(gasps)

297
00:24:51.775 --> 00:24:53.116
(phone ringing)

298
00:24:53.536 --> 00:24:54.350
- Carter.

299
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.570
<i>(elena): You have to come.</i>

300
00:24:56.947 --> 00:24:57.947
- Are you okay?

301
00:24:58.098 --> 00:24:59.706
- Someone was here.

302
00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:02.013
<i>- Don't touch anything,
I'm on my way.</i>

303
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.140
(sighs)

304
00:25:28.053 --> 00:25:29.093
How you holding up?

305
00:25:32.132 --> 00:25:33.372
You've reconsidered my offer?

306
00:25:38.655 --> 00:25:40.855
I think you'll realize
it's the right decision.

307
00:25:45.403 --> 00:25:46.812
This is teresa's signature.

308
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.662
- Yeah.

309
00:25:47.756 --> 00:25:48.496
She signed it

310
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:49.648
And look where it got her.

311
00:25:49.666 --> 00:25:51.833
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

312
00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:53.025
- The program works.

313
00:25:54.263 --> 00:25:55.815
Now, what happened to teresa
shouldn't have happened,

314
00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:57.322
But it was because she left
the witness protection program

315
00:25:57.341 --> 00:25:58.657
To return to her old life.

316
00:25:58.675 --> 00:26:00.008
- One time.

317
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.605
She left once to visit her
own mother after 21 years.

318
00:26:06.275 --> 00:26:08.435
You should've found a
way to keep her safe.

319
00:26:11.614 --> 00:26:12.779
- You're right.

320
00:26:17.102 --> 00:26:19.062
- I do agree with
you on one thing:

321
00:26:20.122 --> 00:26:22.442
Whoever was after my mom
seems to be coming after me.

322
00:26:24.034 --> 00:26:25.292
I can't stay here.

323
00:26:26.462 --> 00:26:27.628
- So what's your plan?

324
00:26:27.855 --> 00:26:30.047
- Visit my grandmother
before it's too late.

325
00:26:32.192 --> 00:26:34.003
- You're going to new jersey?
- Tomorrow.

326
00:26:34.027 --> 00:26:35.284
I bought a plane ticket.

327
00:26:35.379 --> 00:26:37.971
- I can't stress to you
how bad of an idea that is.

328
00:26:38.123 --> 00:26:40.176
You'll be walking straight
into the lion's den.

329
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.791
- I've already
thought it through.

330
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.719
No one there knows me. And
besides, nobody is going

331
00:26:44.872 --> 00:26:46.629
To expect teresa russo's
daughter to suddenly

332
00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:47.463
Show up in town.

333
00:26:47.557 --> 00:26:48.390
- Clearly somebody knows you

334
00:26:48.542 --> 00:26:49.875
Well enough to be targeting you.

335
00:26:49.893 --> 00:26:51.445
I can't keep you safe,
do you understand that?

336
00:26:51.469 --> 00:26:52.560
- I just...

337
00:26:52.713 --> 00:26:54.229
(suspenseful music)

338
00:26:54.806 --> 00:26:55.806
I have to do this.

339
00:26:57.642 --> 00:27:00.552
I need to know who my mother
was and while I'm there,

340
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.828
I'm gonna find her killer.

341
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.390
I'm not bound by
red tape like you.

342
00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:09.169
(scoffs)

343
00:27:11.565 --> 00:27:12.805
- Are your people almost done?

344
00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:14.583
I need to pack.

345
00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:19.499
- Will you let me drive you
to the airport tomorrow?

346
00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:26.019
(mysterious music)

347
00:28:07.062 --> 00:28:08.062
<i>(woman): Hello?</i>

348
00:28:09.623 --> 00:28:10.623
Hello?

349
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.476
<i>Look, I don't need no
perverts calling my...</i>

350
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.652
<i>- Hi.</i>

351
00:28:16.964 --> 00:28:18.204
Is this jacqueline armstrong?

352
00:28:18.815 --> 00:28:20.073
- Who's asking?

353
00:28:21.651 --> 00:28:24.636
- My name is elena matheson,
I'm the daughter of an old

354
00:28:24.729 --> 00:28:26.747
Friend of yours, teresa russo.

355
00:28:26.974 --> 00:28:28.915
<i>- Teresa?</i>

356
00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:30.475
I haven't heard
from her in ages.

357
00:28:30.494 --> 00:28:31.901
<i>I didn't know she
had a daughter.</i>

358
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.920
<i>How is she?</i>

359
00:28:34.982 --> 00:28:37.022
- That's actually
why I'm calling you.

360
00:28:38.168 --> 00:28:39.651
I'm sorry to tell you that

361
00:28:39.744 --> 00:28:41.002
<i>She passed away last week.</i>

362
00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:42.262
- Oh.

363
00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.196
Now that's a shame.

364
00:28:46.435 --> 00:28:48.635
<i>I wish we could have
gotten together again,</i>

365
00:28:48.662 --> 00:28:50.604
<i>For old time's sake.</i>

366
00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:53.918
- Do you still live
in valley plain?

367
00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:54.924
(scoffs)

368
00:28:54.943 --> 00:28:56.017
- At this point,

369
00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:57.444
I'm never getting out.

370
00:28:58.338 --> 00:28:58.853
- I'm flying there tomorrow.

371
00:28:58.947 --> 00:29:00.596
- Oh!

372
00:29:00.616 --> 00:29:01.840
Well, you should
come by for a visit,

373
00:29:01.858 --> 00:29:02.978
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

374
00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:06.435
- I'll probably just
get a rental place.

375
00:29:06.455 --> 00:29:07.695
<i>- Ah, nonsense.</i>

376
00:29:07.848 --> 00:29:09.842
You can stay here. I
mean, it's nothing fancy,

377
00:29:09.866 --> 00:29:11.106
<i>But I've got a room to spare.</i>

378
00:29:12.277 --> 00:29:15.353
- That's really nice
of you, jacqueline.

379
00:29:15.372 --> 00:29:17.108
<i>- Well, teresa was
my best friend.</i>

380
00:29:17.132 --> 00:29:19.024
It's the least I can do.

381
00:29:19.117 --> 00:29:21.468
And please, call me jackie.

382
00:29:22.453 --> 00:29:24.805
(soft music)

383
00:29:29.536 --> 00:29:30.536
(sighs)

384
00:29:31.313 --> 00:29:32.813
- Here, let me help you.

385
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.816
- Oh, I'm good.

386
00:29:38.378 --> 00:29:39.458
- You sure about this?

387
00:29:39.488 --> 00:29:41.062
- Yes. I'm sure.

388
00:29:42.157 --> 00:29:45.050
- Elena, please understand
that my hands are tied.

389
00:29:45.143 --> 00:29:46.309
I wish it could be different

390
00:29:46.328 --> 00:29:47.608
But my boss won't allow me to be

391
00:29:47.645 --> 00:29:48.403
Your handler once you leave.

392
00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:49.554
I won't be able

393
00:29:49.573 --> 00:29:50.733
To guarantee your safety.

394
00:29:51.482 --> 00:29:53.442
- You couldn't
guarantee it anyway.

395
00:29:54.227 --> 00:29:55.227
- Wait.

396
00:29:59.082 --> 00:30:00.242
Where will you be staying?

397
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.992
- With my mom's old friend,
jacqueline armstrong.

398
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:05.306
- Will you at least check in
with me when you get there?

399
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:06.658
Just a text to let
me know you're safe.

400
00:30:06.682 --> 00:30:07.663
- Fine.

401
00:30:07.683 --> 00:30:08.331
- And the address

402
00:30:08.425 --> 00:30:09.999
Of where you're staying.

403
00:30:10.018 --> 00:30:11.268
And her licence plate number.

404
00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:14.315
Actually, if you could text me
once a day, that would be great.

405
00:30:14.339 --> 00:30:15.522
(chuckles)

406
00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:17.997
- We're gonna be late.

407
00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:19.919
- Ah.

408
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.701
(mysterious music)

409
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.544
(city hubbub)

410
00:30:55.898 --> 00:30:57.564
(eerie music)

411
00:31:04.131 --> 00:31:05.313
(gasp)

412
00:31:05.407 --> 00:31:06.407
- Elena!

413
00:31:06.633 --> 00:31:07.966
Is that you?

414
00:31:07.984 --> 00:31:09.242
- Yeah, hi.

415
00:31:10.153 --> 00:31:11.745
- Hi. I'm jackie.

416
00:31:12.748 --> 00:31:14.139
Come on, come on.

417
00:31:14.641 --> 00:31:17.250
Oh my gosh, look at you!

418
00:31:17.402 --> 00:31:19.122
- Oh...
- Here let me take that...

419
00:31:19.146 --> 00:31:20.812
- Oh, it's really...
- Oh, no, I insist.

420
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.405
- Oh.
- Okay, thanks.

421
00:31:22.424 --> 00:31:25.667
Okay, well... Okay,
come on, let's go.

422
00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:27.093
Ooh, you got a lot of stuff.

423
00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:29.262
Welcome.

424
00:31:29.656 --> 00:31:31.414
(chuckling)

425
00:31:31.433 --> 00:31:33.433
Sit, sit, sit.

426
00:31:35.103 --> 00:31:36.183
You must be starving.

427
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:39.088
- Oh, well...
- I made my famous meatloaf,

428
00:31:39.182 --> 00:31:40.515
Everyone loves it.

429
00:31:40.776 --> 00:31:43.351
Oh, it's nice and hot.

430
00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:44.611
(sighs)

431
00:31:44.762 --> 00:31:47.364
Okay, here we are...

432
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.284
There it is.

433
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:55.363
Okay, you've got hot, you've
got cold, you're all set.

434
00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:56.623
(sighing)

435
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.624
- Thank you.

436
00:31:57.851 --> 00:31:59.292
(chuckling)

437
00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:01.599
- I couldn't believe
it when you called.

438
00:32:02.631 --> 00:32:04.500
Yeah... But now that you're
here, you have to tell me

439
00:32:04.524 --> 00:32:06.967
Everything about teresa.
I mean, god rest her.

440
00:32:08.028 --> 00:32:09.785
We were inseparable growing up.

441
00:32:10.639 --> 00:32:13.640
Always had big plans to
get out of this town but...

442
00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:15.954
Of course, teresa was
the one to finally do it.

443
00:32:15.978 --> 00:32:17.293
(laughing)

444
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.813
I often wondered where she went,

445
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.126
I felt like she fell off
the face of the earth.

446
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.650
- Oh...

447
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:24.726
We've been in ohio.

448
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.211
- Ohio?

449
00:32:26.229 --> 00:32:28.154
Why would she go there?

450
00:32:28.381 --> 00:32:30.501
- I don't think she
had much of a choice.

451
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.238
Mom was in witness protection
because of something

452
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.165
That happened before I was born.

453
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.300
I didn't even know about
any of this until she...

454
00:32:42.838 --> 00:32:44.004
Died.

455
00:32:45.749 --> 00:32:49.843
- Wait a sec, is this because of
that trial where she testified?

456
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.752
- Yeah.

457
00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:51.753
(gasping)

458
00:32:51.847 --> 00:32:53.571
- That's crazy!

459
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.424
You mean you didn't know
anything about your family

460
00:32:56.518 --> 00:32:58.799
Or your mother's last name
or any stuff like that?

461
00:32:58.912 --> 00:32:59.998
- I've never even
met my grandmother...

462
00:33:00.022 --> 00:33:01.022
- Oh.

463
00:33:01.081 --> 00:33:02.081
- And...

464
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.190
I hear she's not doing too well.

465
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.860
- Sweet sofia.

466
00:33:08.088 --> 00:33:10.655
I heard she's over at
greenpoint hospital.

467
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.660
We can go visit
her if you'd like.

468
00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:14.926
(clears throat)

469
00:33:15.353 --> 00:33:16.369
What's the matter?

470
00:33:17.873 --> 00:33:19.039
- I...

471
00:33:21.284 --> 00:33:24.377
It just hit me all of a
sudden that she's so close.

472
00:33:26.773 --> 00:33:29.365
- I get it, it's
a lot to take in.

473
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.196
I'll tell you what, why
don't you finish eating

474
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.779
And then I'll show you to your
room, you can get some rest,

475
00:33:34.798 --> 00:33:36.798
And we can talk
more in the morning.

476
00:33:37.467 --> 00:33:39.467
- Thank you for
everything, jackie.

477
00:33:40.136 --> 00:33:41.544
- Are you kidding?

478
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:44.731
There's nothing I
wouldn't do for teresa.

479
00:33:48.904 --> 00:33:50.795
Eat, it's good.

480
00:33:50.814 --> 00:33:51.883
It'll make you feel good.

481
00:33:51.907 --> 00:33:53.798
It makes me feel good.

482
00:33:53.817 --> 00:33:55.241
(laughing)

483
00:33:55.468 --> 00:33:56.910
(soft music)

484
00:34:10.092 --> 00:34:11.925
(shaky breathing)

485
00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:13.152
Hey.

486
00:34:14.096 --> 00:34:15.096
You okay?

487
00:34:17.674 --> 00:34:19.657
- I'm just starting to realize
that to my grandmother,

488
00:34:19.676 --> 00:34:23.103
I'm a complete stranger. And I
know she's really sick but...

489
00:34:24.514 --> 00:34:26.809
What if my going in there
just gives her a shock so bad

490
00:34:26.833 --> 00:34:27.941
That it'll kill her?

491
00:34:28.092 --> 00:34:30.777
- Oh, honey,
sofia's a tough one.

492
00:34:32.021 --> 00:34:34.197
I think she'll be
overjoyed to see you.

493
00:34:35.283 --> 00:34:36.449
- No.

494
00:34:37.527 --> 00:34:38.952
No, I can't do this.

495
00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:41.789
- That's okay.

496
00:34:43.441 --> 00:34:47.034
If you're not ready now, we can
come back another time, okay?

497
00:34:47.854 --> 00:34:50.279
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go, come on.

498
00:34:50.373 --> 00:34:52.093
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

499
00:34:53.209 --> 00:34:55.301
It's okay, we'll come
back another time.

500
00:35:05.647 --> 00:35:06.537
- Where are we?

501
00:35:06.631 --> 00:35:08.373
- It's your grandmother's house,

502
00:35:08.466 --> 00:35:09.666
It's where your mom grew up.

503
00:35:10.727 --> 00:35:12.877
- Aw... There's that picture
of you and my mom standing

504
00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:14.061
On the lawn as teenagers.

505
00:35:14.156 --> 00:35:15.156
- Mm-hmm.

506
00:35:15.565 --> 00:35:16.731
- So who lives there now?

507
00:35:17.826 --> 00:35:20.146
- Oh, sofia still owns it,
but I don't think anyone's

508
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.662
Staying there while
she's in the hospital.

509
00:35:25.558 --> 00:35:26.558
Come on.

510
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.310
- Where are you going?

511
00:35:34.234 --> 00:35:36.759
What? Uh...

512
00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:47.246
- Ah.

513
00:35:48.248 --> 00:35:50.168
- I don't think
we should be here.

514
00:35:50.192 --> 00:35:51.274
- Don't worry,

515
00:35:52.677 --> 00:35:54.877
Sofia used to keep a
spare key hidden out here.

516
00:35:55.864 --> 00:35:57.438
- Are you crazy?

517
00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.590
- Relax.

518
00:36:00.685 --> 00:36:03.261
I think if you could inside
the house it would help you

519
00:36:03.354 --> 00:36:04.594
Get to know your grandmother.

520
00:36:06.115 --> 00:36:08.625
Then you might feel more
comfortable visiting her, okay?

521
00:36:14.031 --> 00:36:16.457
Key's gotta be here somewhere.

522
00:36:16.551 --> 00:36:18.134
(groaning)

523
00:36:19.888 --> 00:36:21.112
(meowing)

524
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.130
(gasping)

525
00:36:22.282 --> 00:36:23.282
- Oh.

526
00:36:27.136 --> 00:36:29.229
Hey there, kitty.

527
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.639
Jackie.

528
00:36:31.733 --> 00:36:32.733
- What?

529
00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:34.901
Someone's been feeding the cat.

530
00:36:38.723 --> 00:36:41.324
- It's fine, don't
worry so much.

531
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.660
- Jackie...

532
00:36:51.644 --> 00:36:53.253
- You're right, we should leave.

533
00:36:57.926 --> 00:36:59.092
Let's go!

534
00:36:59.319 --> 00:37:00.319
(sighing)

535
00:37:02.264 --> 00:37:05.098
(eerie music)

536
00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:20.947
- I'm trying to avoid breaking

537
00:37:21.174 --> 00:37:22.598
And entering here,
can't you help?

538
00:37:22.617 --> 00:37:24.600
- I'm not sure what
you want me to do.

539
00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:26.177
- There's gotta be a way to
remotely access someone's

540
00:37:26.195 --> 00:37:27.315
Recorded video footage.

541
00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:30.083
I figured you feds must
know how to do that.

542
00:37:30.107 --> 00:37:32.183
- Elena, you need to stay
away from that house.

543
00:37:32.201 --> 00:37:34.685
- I know, that's why I'm
trying to do this remotely.

544
00:37:34.704 --> 00:37:36.665
- Forget about that for a
minute, this is dangerous.

545
00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:38.280
<i>Anyone could be
waiting for you there.</i>

546
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.707
- No one has a clue I'm here.

547
00:37:39.801 --> 00:37:41.784
<i>- Don't be naive, elena,
someone broke into your house.</i>

548
00:37:41.803 --> 00:37:44.304
It is possible, even likely,
they know where you are.

549
00:37:45.198 --> 00:37:46.789
- Look, if you're telling
me that there's not a way

550
00:37:46.808 --> 00:37:48.861
To remotely access those
cameras, then I'll just have

551
00:37:48.885 --> 00:37:50.346
<i>To go in there to
see for myself.</i>

552
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.290
- No, that's not
what I'm saying.

553
00:37:52.372 --> 00:37:53.128
- Don't you get it?

554
00:37:53.148 --> 00:37:54.539
This is my mom's childhood home,

555
00:37:54.557 --> 00:37:55.964
<i>For all we know, she went there</i>

556
00:37:55.984 --> 00:37:57.132
That last day and that footage

557
00:37:57.152 --> 00:37:59.560
Could tell us if anyone
one was with her.

558
00:37:59.712 --> 00:38:01.524
- I hear what you're saying,
but there's an official way

559
00:38:01.548 --> 00:38:02.748
These things should be done.

560
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.324
- You and your red tape.

561
00:38:06.143 --> 00:38:07.143
- Elena...

562
00:38:07.904 --> 00:38:09.162
(sighs)

563
00:38:23.828 --> 00:38:24.828
(knocking)

564
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.330
- Come in.

565
00:38:30.593 --> 00:38:31.576
- You doing okay?

566
00:38:31.594 --> 00:38:32.769
- Yeah.

567
00:38:35.598 --> 00:38:37.023
- That was a great day.

568
00:38:37.917 --> 00:38:40.935
We ditched our last class
and went to the movies.

569
00:38:41.087 --> 00:38:44.697
We snuck into dangerous minds
and ate our weight in candy.

570
00:38:44.924 --> 00:38:46.282
(chuckling)

571
00:38:47.518 --> 00:38:49.017
- Can I ask you something?

572
00:38:49.037 --> 00:38:50.037
- Shoot.

573
00:38:51.447 --> 00:38:53.807
- I was thinking and, you
were right, it would be good

574
00:38:53.858 --> 00:38:56.058
For me to get inside of
my grandmother's house.

575
00:38:56.269 --> 00:38:58.694
I do want to try to
get to know who she is.

576
00:38:58.713 --> 00:39:00.994
Is there any way you might
know of another way in?

577
00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:03.457
- I don't know.

578
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.679
I didn't realize before
that there would be cameras.

579
00:39:05.703 --> 00:39:08.279
- Yeah, but the cameras
could be a lot of help to us.

580
00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:11.115
Maybe they picked up something
that could show me what happened

581
00:39:11.134 --> 00:39:13.893
To my mom, like
someone following her.

582
00:39:16.122 --> 00:39:19.023
- I do know of one other way
through a basement window...

583
00:39:20.476 --> 00:39:22.796
At least that's what we
used to use back in the day.

584
00:39:23.387 --> 00:39:24.404
- It isn't locked?

585
00:39:25.573 --> 00:39:27.533
- The latch was
busted back then.

586
00:39:27.575 --> 00:39:30.151
I used to help teresa sneak
through there whenever

587
00:39:30.303 --> 00:39:31.744
We'd be out past curfew.

588
00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:33.371
Could be worth a shot.

589
00:39:34.807 --> 00:39:35.990
- Can I borrow your car?

590
00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:39.493
- Ugh, keys are
hanging by the door,

591
00:39:39.587 --> 00:39:41.145
Don't tell me when you leave,

592
00:39:41.164 --> 00:39:43.204
I don't need to know
anything about it.

593
00:39:46.911 --> 00:39:47.911
(car door closing)

594
00:39:48.154 --> 00:39:49.429
(suspenseful music)

595
00:40:21.296 --> 00:40:22.296
(alarm sounding)

596
00:40:22.522 --> 00:40:23.562
(suspenseful music)

597
00:40:53.052 --> 00:40:54.118
- Come on...

598
00:41:10.845 --> 00:41:14.263
(sirens blaring)

599
00:41:19.428 --> 00:41:21.312
(tires screeching)

600
00:41:51.386 --> 00:41:53.010
(distant dog barking)

601
00:41:54.872 --> 00:41:57.682
I can't believe you're here.
Thanks for bailing me out.

602
00:42:00.044 --> 00:42:02.136
Aren't you going
to say something?

603
00:42:02.972 --> 00:42:05.122
For god's sake, can you
just say something already?

604
00:42:05.141 --> 00:42:06.791
- Do you need me to
tell you how reckless

605
00:42:06.809 --> 00:42:08.216
That stunt was that you pulled?

606
00:42:08.236 --> 00:42:09.643
- I wouldn't call that a stunt.

607
00:42:09.737 --> 00:42:12.646
- How it cost you whatever
anonymity you had and revealed

608
00:42:12.799 --> 00:42:15.035
Your blatant lack of concern
not only for yourself but also

609
00:42:15.059 --> 00:42:17.099
For your friend
jacqueline and for me.

610
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:19.394
- I'm sorry.

611
00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:20.949
- You're not my
only case, you know?

612
00:42:20.973 --> 00:42:22.973
But you're the only one
I have to drop everything

613
00:42:22.992 --> 00:42:24.453
For and get on a
flight to new jersey!

614
00:42:24.477 --> 00:42:25.901
- I'm not your case at all.

615
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.069
I left the program, remember?

616
00:42:27.088 --> 00:42:28.329
- I remember.

617
00:42:28.423 --> 00:42:30.756
(distant sirens)

618
00:42:32.594 --> 00:42:33.594
(sighs)

619
00:42:35.822 --> 00:42:39.390
I made a promise to your mother,
to always look out for you.

620
00:42:41.919 --> 00:42:42.935
So here I am

621
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:48.722
I'm driving you back to
jacqueline's for the night.

622
00:43:24.479 --> 00:43:26.103
- What?

623
00:43:26.706 --> 00:43:27.146
(sighs)

624
00:43:27.373 --> 00:43:31.275
(suspenseful music)

625
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:42.570
(gasping)

626
00:43:50.413 --> 00:43:52.505
Is that hair... Is
that my mom's hair?

627
00:43:55.918 --> 00:43:57.401
- Change of plans.

628
00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.827
You're leaving with me.

629
00:43:58.921 --> 00:44:00.070
We'll get the next flight home.

630
00:44:00.089 --> 00:44:01.755
- But... I'm not leaving.

631
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:03.552
- There's been two obvious
threats made against you,

632
00:44:03.576 --> 00:44:06.054
Three if you count that person
lurking around your front door.

633
00:44:06.078 --> 00:44:07.335
You just got arrested
and you're staying

634
00:44:07.355 --> 00:44:08.187
With a woman you barely know.

635
00:44:08.338 --> 00:44:08.929
- My mom knew her,

636
00:44:09.081 --> 00:44:10.005
That's enough for me.

637
00:44:10.024 --> 00:44:11.315
- Your mother also knew killers!

638
00:44:12.101 --> 00:44:13.101
(sighing)

639
00:44:14.344 --> 00:44:15.344
I'm sorry.

640
00:44:16.255 --> 00:44:17.455
I'm just worried about you.

641
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.014
I want you to come
back with me now

642
00:44:19.033 --> 00:44:20.313
So we can arrange a fresh start.

643
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.160
- And I want to go back inside.

644
00:44:45.952 --> 00:44:48.227
(suspenseful music)

645
00:44:55.795 --> 00:44:58.571
- Sorry, I tried to quit,
but I just get so nervous

646
00:44:58.722 --> 00:44:59.722
With these things.

647
00:45:03.911 --> 00:45:05.302
- The house is clear.

648
00:45:05.321 --> 00:45:07.654
- Now will you tell
me what's going on?

649
00:45:07.807 --> 00:45:08.914
- Show her the note.

650
00:45:09.066 --> 00:45:09.898
- What note?

651
00:45:09.917 --> 00:45:11.158
- It's confidential evidence.

652
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.159
I'd still feel better

653
00:45:12.253 --> 00:45:12.977
If you'd come with me.

654
00:45:12.995 --> 00:45:14.812
- Oh, no, no, no.

655
00:45:14.905 --> 00:45:17.405
Elena's on her own
journey, she needs answers.

656
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.811
- I'm sorry for what happened
today and I apologize

657
00:45:19.835 --> 00:45:21.129
For bringing you all
the way out here.

658
00:45:21.153 --> 00:45:22.987
I...

659
00:45:23.005 --> 00:45:24.633
I realized I haven't been
going about things the right

660
00:45:24.657 --> 00:45:26.223
Way but I do need more time.

661
00:45:26.934 --> 00:45:28.158
- What about tonight?

662
00:45:28.177 --> 00:45:29.821
- We'll lock all the
doors and the windows

663
00:45:29.845 --> 00:45:30.973
And won't let anybody in.

664
00:45:30.997 --> 00:45:32.420
- Good plan.

665
00:45:32.515 --> 00:45:34.142
Do you have a couch
I can crash on?

666
00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:35.166
- Sure.

667
00:45:35.684 --> 00:45:37.092
- You're gonna sleep here?

668
00:45:37.686 --> 00:45:39.261
- You need a
toothbrush or anything?

669
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.762
- I have what I need.

670
00:45:40.782 --> 00:45:42.062
You got me out here, now I have

671
00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:43.374
To make sure you stay safe.

672
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:47.678
- I'll make us dinner.

673
00:45:47.696 --> 00:45:48.529
- Sounds great.

674
00:45:48.623 --> 00:45:49.680
- I'll help you.

675
00:45:49.773 --> 00:45:51.813
- Okay, why don't
you go get settled?

676
00:46:02.528 --> 00:46:04.211
- Jackie...

677
00:46:04.305 --> 00:46:06.547
With everything that's going on,

678
00:46:06.699 --> 00:46:09.550
I completely understand if you
don't want me staying here.

679
00:46:09.702 --> 00:46:10.742
I'll leave any time.

680
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:11.960
- Absolutely not. I meant it

681
00:46:11.979 --> 00:46:13.704
When I said I wanted to help.

682
00:46:13.889 --> 00:46:15.314
Anything for teresa's daughter.

683
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.113
- When I went to my
grandmother's house,

684
00:46:20.137 --> 00:46:22.257
I found something that
I want to show you.

685
00:46:26.828 --> 00:46:28.068
Do you know who this is?

686
00:46:28.162 --> 00:46:29.311
(dramatic music)

687
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.665
- That's lorenzo bruno, your...

688
00:46:32.816 --> 00:46:34.333
- My father.

689
00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:39.897
- He and my mom had a
confrontation the day she died.

690
00:46:39.915 --> 00:46:42.115
I think he had something
to do with her death.

691
00:46:42.677 --> 00:46:44.176
I think that he's wanted revenge

692
00:46:44.403 --> 00:46:46.483
Ever since my mom
testified against him.

693
00:46:46.922 --> 00:46:48.826
What do you know
about the trial?

694
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.933
- Oh, well, I was there.

695
00:46:54.355 --> 00:46:56.856
Your mother was the star
witness for the prosecution.

696
00:46:57.674 --> 00:47:00.008
The jury found her sympathetic
because she was emotional

697
00:47:00.027 --> 00:47:01.768
And visibly pregnant.

698
00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:04.346
Hey, you know what?

699
00:47:04.365 --> 00:47:06.365
Technically, you were there too.

700
00:47:06.516 --> 00:47:07.516
(chuckling)

701
00:47:08.703 --> 00:47:09.983
- Carter says that maybe lorenzo

702
00:47:10.037 --> 00:47:12.020
Changed after all these years.

703
00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:13.539
Do you think that could be true?

704
00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.624
- Honestly?

705
00:47:17.361 --> 00:47:19.601
I think you can change
the suit but not the man.

706
00:47:21.716 --> 00:47:23.048
Ready?

707
00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:31.223
(mysterious music)

708
00:47:51.487 --> 00:47:52.912
(sighing)

709
00:48:30.934 --> 00:48:32.100
(creaking)

710
00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:33.026
(thud)

711
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.120
(gasps)

712
00:48:42.688 --> 00:48:43.688
- Freeze!

713
00:48:43.872 --> 00:48:45.631
Stand up, slowly.

714
00:48:47.635 --> 00:48:49.595
- Which is it,
freeze or stand up?

715
00:48:50.304 --> 00:48:51.136
(sighs)

716
00:48:51.288 --> 00:48:52.029
- I'm sorry.

717
00:48:52.122 --> 00:48:53.430
I was sleeping pretty hard.

718
00:48:54.533 --> 00:48:56.558
I thought someone broke in.

719
00:48:57.886 --> 00:48:59.046
Let me have one of those.

720
00:49:07.713 --> 00:49:11.973
- So, I was doing some research online
and came across lorenzo's company.

721
00:49:11.993 --> 00:49:13.492
They're real estate developers

722
00:49:13.719 --> 00:49:14.879
And it looks like
they're hiring.

723
00:49:14.903 --> 00:49:15.719
So I thought I'd apply,

724
00:49:15.812 --> 00:49:17.312
See if I can get an interview

725
00:49:17.406 --> 00:49:17.997
And guess what?

726
00:49:18.148 --> 00:49:18.813
- You did.

727
00:49:18.907 --> 00:49:19.890
- Interview's tomorrow.

728
00:49:19.908 --> 00:49:21.575
- Are you nuts?

729
00:49:21.669 --> 00:49:23.318
- I thought you might
want to give me a ride.

730
00:49:23.337 --> 00:49:25.062
- No! This is a terrible plan,

731
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.672
It invites trouble to find you!

732
00:49:27.399 --> 00:49:29.211
Look, I'm doing what I
can to keep you safe,

733
00:49:29.235 --> 00:49:30.400
But every minute you're
out of the program,

734
00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:31.568
Your life is on the line!

735
00:49:31.587 --> 00:49:32.678
- Look.

736
00:49:34.423 --> 00:49:35.739
- Is that lorenzo?

737
00:49:35.832 --> 00:49:37.832
- Yeah. He was at my
grandmother's house harassing

738
00:49:37.852 --> 00:49:39.334
My mom the day she was killed.

739
00:49:39.912 --> 00:49:40.998
You need evidence, right?

740
00:49:41.022 --> 00:49:42.746
Something to prove it was him?

741
00:49:42.765 --> 00:49:44.984
Well, all I'd have to do is
gain access to his office,

742
00:49:45.008 --> 00:49:46.600
Take a peek at his schedule,

743
00:49:46.752 --> 00:49:48.009
Maybe his location
history on his phone.

744
00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:49.844
That way we could at least prove

745
00:49:49.938 --> 00:49:52.298
Whether or not he was at the
hospital during that time.

746
00:49:53.275 --> 00:49:54.700
Stop shaking your head.

747
00:49:56.929 --> 00:50:00.614
I wish I could get
past this but I can't.

748
00:50:00.766 --> 00:50:02.599
My mom was all I had.

749
00:50:02.618 --> 00:50:06.045
After she died I found out that
everything I knew was a lie.

750
00:50:07.048 --> 00:50:08.672
I need to find out the truth.

751
00:50:12.887 --> 00:50:16.296
- Maybe we can work together,
but you have to be careful.

752
00:50:16.448 --> 00:50:18.448
Don't take any
unnecessary risks.

753
00:50:18.467 --> 00:50:20.347
Can you promise me that?
- Yes.

754
00:50:21.562 --> 00:50:23.804
- That feeling in your gut...

755
00:50:23.898 --> 00:50:24.898
Trust it.

756
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:27.969
And I'll give you a ride.

757
00:50:36.893 --> 00:50:38.911
(mysterious music)

758
00:50:43.142 --> 00:50:44.583
(panting)

759
00:50:59.082 --> 00:51:00.635
- Are you looking
for the receptionist?

760
00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:01.341
- Yeah.

761
00:51:01.493 --> 00:51:02.843
- She should be right back.

762
00:51:02.995 --> 00:51:03.995
- Thanks.

763
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:06.611
- Here you go, have a good one.

764
00:51:07.333 --> 00:51:08.607
Bye.

765
00:51:13.614 --> 00:51:15.774
Do you want to order a
coffee while you wait?

766
00:51:20.287 --> 00:51:24.348
- I shouldn't, I'm here
for a job interview

767
00:51:24.366 --> 00:51:26.107
And I'm already nervous enough.

768
00:51:26.201 --> 00:51:28.109
- Okay, let me guess...

769
00:51:28.203 --> 00:51:29.703
Administrative assistant?

770
00:51:29.855 --> 00:51:30.921
- No.

771
00:51:31.874 --> 00:51:32.631
- Engineer?

772
00:51:32.782 --> 00:51:33.782
(chuckles)

773
00:51:33.859 --> 00:51:34.708
- No.

774
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.968
- Uh...

775
00:51:36.119 --> 00:51:37.199
Marketing department?

776
00:51:37.363 --> 00:51:38.363
- Mailroom.

777
00:51:39.365 --> 00:51:40.565
- Okay, mailroom's the best.

778
00:51:42.643 --> 00:51:45.218
Seriously, there's a great
group of people down there.

779
00:51:45.371 --> 00:51:48.313
And hey, we all got to get our
foot in the door somehow, hm?

780
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:51.725
I'm allie by the way.

781
00:51:51.877 --> 00:51:52.877
- Elena.

782
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:55.114
How long have you
been working here?

783
00:51:55.138 --> 00:51:57.731
- Just a few months.
Only part-time, though.

784
00:51:57.883 --> 00:52:00.283
The rest of the time I take
classes over at the college.

785
00:52:00.327 --> 00:52:01.651
- Oh, she's back.

786
00:52:01.904 --> 00:52:03.162
Hey.

787
00:52:03.813 --> 00:52:04.813
Good luck.

788
00:52:18.179 --> 00:52:19.381
- Are you gonna wish me luck?

789
00:52:19.405 --> 00:52:21.232
- I'm gonna remind
you of your promise.

790
00:52:21.256 --> 00:52:22.384
Now remember to call me...

791
00:52:22.408 --> 00:52:24.016
- If I feel threatened.

792
00:52:25.744 --> 00:52:26.744
Got it.

793
00:52:28.338 --> 00:52:29.354
- Alright.

794
00:52:39.033 --> 00:52:40.033
Go on.

795
00:52:41.184 --> 00:52:43.869
(mysterious music)

796
00:53:10.064 --> 00:53:12.064
- Seventh floor...

797
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.591
(suspenseful music)

798
00:53:53.348 --> 00:53:55.256
I have mail for mr. Bruno.

799
00:53:55.276 --> 00:53:57.716
- No one enters mr. Bruno's
office without an appointment.

800
00:53:58.279 --> 00:54:00.399
Especially not someone
from the mail room.

801
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:09.030
Is that it?

802
00:54:12.017 --> 00:54:13.458
- Here's that file.

803
00:54:13.685 --> 00:54:15.765
Tell allison to
double-check the numbers.

804
00:54:17.689 --> 00:54:19.298
(indistinct chatter)

805
00:54:29.125 --> 00:54:30.642
(suspenseful music)

806
00:54:31.961 --> 00:54:33.386
- Oh, you idiot.

807
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.147
Get it together.

808
00:54:49.979 --> 00:54:51.939
You've been quiet
the whole drive.

809
00:54:52.891 --> 00:54:53.891
How'd it go?

810
00:54:55.151 --> 00:54:56.335
- I saw him today...

811
00:54:58.397 --> 00:54:59.397
Lorenzo.

812
00:55:01.342 --> 00:55:03.491
I thought I was prepared
but it was just so sudden

813
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.069
And he was just...

814
00:55:06.088 --> 00:55:07.754
There and...

815
00:55:07.848 --> 00:55:09.831
I probably drew too much
attention to myself staring

816
00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:10.885
At him like an idiot.

817
00:55:10.909 --> 00:55:11.999
- No.

818
00:55:12.094 --> 00:55:13.243
Probably feels worse than

819
00:55:13.261 --> 00:55:14.077
It was because you've been

820
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.410
Playing it over in your head.

821
00:55:16.765 --> 00:55:18.576
Did he recognize you?
- No.

822
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.858
No, at least there's that.

823
00:55:21.603 --> 00:55:24.065
- But his assistant is going to
be a major road block for us,

824
00:55:24.089 --> 00:55:25.209
She's like a guard dog.

825
00:55:26.608 --> 00:55:28.753
- Then you'll have to get into
his office when she's not there.

826
00:55:28.777 --> 00:55:30.494
(suspenseful music)

827
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.585
You know, you don't have
to do this right now?

828
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:45.689
Especially not after
the day you've had.

829
00:55:45.777 --> 00:55:46.777
- I'm okay.

830
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:01.124
- Hi!

831
00:56:01.143 --> 00:56:02.550
I...

832
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:04.385
Do you remember me from work?

833
00:56:04.479 --> 00:56:07.464
- Of course, gosh, hey!

834
00:56:07.482 --> 00:56:08.148
Congrats on getting the job.

835
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.408
- Thanks.

836
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:11.151
Do you work here too?

837
00:56:11.303 --> 00:56:13.153
- Yeah, I intern here part time

838
00:56:13.247 --> 00:56:15.580
For school credit. And
some day, I'll be a nurse.

839
00:56:16.324 --> 00:56:17.324
- That's great.

840
00:56:18.919 --> 00:56:21.086
- Are you, um, visiting someone?

841
00:56:22.423 --> 00:56:24.214
- Yeah, kind of.

842
00:56:25.926 --> 00:56:30.153
My grandmother is sick but
I've never actually met her

843
00:56:30.172 --> 00:56:33.323
But I really want
to go and visit her.

844
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:35.892
I'm just afraid that the
shock might be too much.

845
00:56:36.662 --> 00:56:38.344
- Hm.

846
00:56:38.497 --> 00:56:39.996
You want some friendly advice?

847
00:56:40.015 --> 00:56:41.514
- Yeah, please.

848
00:56:41.608 --> 00:56:42.832
- Go see her.

849
00:56:42.926 --> 00:56:44.886
People are stronger
than you think.

850
00:56:46.262 --> 00:56:48.262
Look, I mean, if you're
not feeling ready for it,

851
00:56:48.282 --> 00:56:49.408
I can check in on
your grandmother

852
00:56:49.432 --> 00:56:50.598
The next time I come in.

853
00:56:50.692 --> 00:56:52.932
I can text you and let
you know how she's doing.

854
00:56:53.512 --> 00:56:54.552
- You would do that?

855
00:56:54.604 --> 00:56:56.437
- Sure, it's no problem.

856
00:56:56.531 --> 00:56:57.571
Give me your phone.

857
00:57:03.297 --> 00:57:05.130
Alright, there.

858
00:57:05.357 --> 00:57:08.800
You have my number
and now I have yours.

859
00:57:11.287 --> 00:57:12.696
I can't thank you
enough for this.

860
00:57:12.714 --> 00:57:13.972
- Any time.

861
00:57:14.199 --> 00:57:16.199
I'll see you at work, okay?
- Yeah.

862
00:57:24.376 --> 00:57:25.442
Don't start.

863
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.406
(glass breaking)

864
00:57:40.501 --> 00:57:41.482
(gasping)

865
00:57:41.502 --> 00:57:42.667
(eerie music)

866
00:57:47.341 --> 00:57:48.341
- What the...

867
00:57:49.843 --> 00:57:50.843
Let me.

868
00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:57.849
- What is that?

869
00:57:58.927 --> 00:58:00.769
(heavy breathing)

870
00:58:15.427 --> 00:58:17.869
"don't make the same
mistake your mom made."

871
00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.521
- I saw him, I saw him!

872
00:58:20.541 --> 00:58:24.434
I was taking the trash
and... I... I saw the bastard

873
00:58:24.452 --> 00:58:26.603
That threw it and I chased him
down the street but he jumped

874
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:27.437
The fence and I lost him!

875
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:28.788
- Well, did you see his face?

876
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.220
- No, he had a hoodie pulled up.

877
00:58:31.126 --> 00:58:32.126
What's that?

878
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.440
- "you're a smash at
your new job but that

879
00:58:36.464 --> 00:58:37.744
Disguise isn't fooling anyone."

880
00:58:39.208 --> 00:58:40.762
- Time to move.
We need to leave.

881
00:58:40.786 --> 00:58:41.785
- Leave, what? No,
what about jackie?

882
00:58:41.803 --> 00:58:43.303
- Don't worry about me.

883
00:58:43.455 --> 00:58:44.879
- Gut check, you made a promise.

884
00:58:44.973 --> 00:58:45.789
- Jackie, I really...

885
00:58:45.882 --> 00:58:46.956
- No, the most important thing

886
00:58:46.975 --> 00:58:49.125
Is your safety, just
go, I'll be fine.

887
00:58:49.144 --> 00:58:51.363
- Grab what you need for work
tomorrow, we'll come back for

888
00:58:51.387 --> 00:58:52.145
The rest of your stuff later.

889
00:58:52.297 --> 00:58:53.297
- Go.

890
00:59:09.405 --> 00:59:10.647
- Things are getting worse.

891
00:59:11.258 --> 00:59:13.074
That brick is the last straw.

892
00:59:13.093 --> 00:59:16.072
We'll get rooms at this motel for
now but we don't have a lot of time.

893
00:59:16.096 --> 00:59:18.079
I need to identify this
threat and take it out.

894
00:59:18.098 --> 00:59:19.892
- Don't you think if this
person wanted to kill me,

895
00:59:19.916 --> 00:59:20.673
They would have done it already?

896
00:59:20.767 --> 00:59:21.658
- That the theory you're

897
00:59:21.751 --> 00:59:22.912
Willing to stake your life on?

898
00:59:22.936 --> 00:59:25.662
- Well, I'm...
- Psychopaths are like cats,

899
00:59:25.755 --> 00:59:27.900
Some like to play with their
prey before they make their kill.

900
00:59:27.924 --> 00:59:29.608
- Now it's a psychopath?

901
00:59:29.759 --> 00:59:31.668
- I'm no profiler, but
just look at the facts.

902
00:59:31.686 --> 00:59:33.945
Those little notes?
Pure egocentrism,

903
00:59:34.172 --> 00:59:36.005
Aggressive arrogance,
impulsivity...

904
00:59:36.024 --> 00:59:37.690
- It's obviously lorenzo.

905
00:59:37.843 --> 00:59:39.117
- We don't know that for sure!

906
00:59:40.695 --> 00:59:42.103
- I just...

907
00:59:42.122 --> 00:59:44.403
I just hate that I have
to leave jackie like that.

908
00:59:44.458 --> 00:59:46.418
- Jackie will be fine,
you're the one they're after.

909
00:59:46.442 --> 00:59:47.626
With you out of the house,

910
00:59:47.853 --> 00:59:49.813
Jackie won't be
in danger anymore.

911
00:59:50.705 --> 00:59:52.091
Maybe this will finally
convince you not

912
00:59:52.115 --> 00:59:53.684
To let your guard
down with new people.

913
00:59:53.708 --> 00:59:54.966
- Let my guard down?

914
00:59:55.193 --> 00:59:56.354
- Giving your number
to strangers like

915
00:59:56.378 --> 00:59:57.521
That girl at the hospital?

916
00:59:57.545 --> 00:59:59.665
- She wasn't a stranger,
I met her at work.

917
01:00:01.308 --> 01:00:03.867
- You didn't think to mention
that coincidence before?

918
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.368
A girl from lorenzo's office

919
01:00:05.461 --> 01:00:07.606
Just happened to be at the
hospital the same time as you?

920
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.130
- You really think they
could both be involved?

921
01:00:09.149 --> 01:00:10.149
- Yes!

922
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:13.209
In order for me to keep you
safe, I need you to not tell

923
01:00:13.228 --> 01:00:16.062
Anyone, not jackie, not that
girl from work, where you'll be

924
01:00:16.214 --> 01:00:17.494
Staying, do you understand that?

925
01:00:18.158 --> 01:00:19.658
- Yes.

926
01:00:21.403 --> 01:00:23.923
- I need you to cut off contact
with both of them, completely.

927
01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:27.176
Only until we figure
out who's behind this.

928
01:00:27.392 --> 01:00:28.500
Deal?

929
01:00:32.506 --> 01:00:33.506
- Fine.

930
01:00:35.509 --> 01:00:37.676
- Now come on, let's
go get some rooms.

931
01:00:39.346 --> 01:00:40.679
(mysterious music)

932
01:01:20.462 --> 01:01:23.054
(suspenseful music)

933
01:01:27.302 --> 01:01:28.302
- 7:40!

934
01:02:03.597 --> 01:02:06.097
Okay...

935
01:02:06.324 --> 01:02:07.673
Calendar...

936
01:02:07.826 --> 01:02:09.434
Come on.

937
01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.104
Yes!

938
01:02:13.331 --> 01:02:15.607
4:15 train to new
jersey, gotcha.

939
01:02:25.343 --> 01:02:27.268
- And if you get in a
bind, you can call me.

940
01:02:27.287 --> 01:02:28.787
- Don't worry, I can handle it.

941
01:02:30.849 --> 01:02:32.682
- Just doing my rounds.

942
01:02:33.351 --> 01:02:34.626
- You're new here, aren't you?

943
01:02:35.128 --> 01:02:36.128
- Uh...

944
01:02:37.464 --> 01:02:39.745
This elena, she started
in the mailroom last week.

945
01:02:40.692 --> 01:02:42.837
- I try to make a point
of meeting all new hires,

946
01:02:42.861 --> 01:02:44.981
I like to know who I
have working for me.

947
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:46.696
- How nice.

948
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:47.989
- I usually ask my assistant

949
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:49.365
To schedule new employees

950
01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:50.694
For a meet-and-great with me.

951
01:02:50.718 --> 01:02:51.998
I apologize that we have seemed

952
01:02:52.037 --> 01:02:53.369
To have overlooked that,

953
01:02:53.462 --> 01:02:54.795
But we'll correct that now.

954
01:02:54.815 --> 01:02:55.958
Portia, will you block out some

955
01:02:55.982 --> 01:02:56.706
Time this week for me

956
01:02:56.799 --> 01:02:58.207
To meet with elena, here.

957
01:02:58.301 --> 01:03:00.968
- You can do Thursday.
- Thursday it is.

958
01:03:00.987 --> 01:03:02.737
See you then.

959
01:03:03.639 --> 01:03:04.639
- See you.

960
01:03:06.159 --> 01:03:08.475
- Hey, what's up? I
texted you earlier.

961
01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:10.736
- Sorry, I've been really busy.

962
01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:13.414
(suspenseful music)

963
01:03:16.837 --> 01:03:17.837
- Are you okay?

964
01:03:18.988 --> 01:03:22.340
- Yeah, I just wasn't
expecting that.

965
01:03:23.343 --> 01:03:25.401
- I should've warned you
about the meet-and-great.

966
01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:28.012
Many have tried but I'm afraid
there's no getting out of it.

967
01:03:29.498 --> 01:03:30.756
Is that why you were in there?

968
01:03:30.909 --> 01:03:33.259
- Me? Uh... No, I'm...

969
01:03:33.411 --> 01:03:35.222
I'm helping lorenzo
with his side project.

970
01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:37.206
I could really use
the extra cash.

971
01:03:37.691 --> 01:03:38.581
- What is it?

972
01:03:38.674 --> 01:03:40.024
- I can't really talk about it,

973
01:03:40.176 --> 01:03:42.360
He made me sign an nda

974
01:03:43.755 --> 01:03:44.755
Oh.

975
01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:46.772
Hey!

976
01:03:47.367 --> 01:03:49.516
That's a really pretty scarf.

977
01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:52.331
It reminds me of one
my mom used to have.

978
01:03:52.355 --> 01:03:53.435
- It's nice, isn't it?

979
01:03:55.024 --> 01:03:56.708
I actually just picked it up.

980
01:03:57.285 --> 01:03:59.365
You can borrow it
sometime if you'd like.

981
01:03:59.771 --> 01:04:00.527
- Thanks.

982
01:04:00.547 --> 01:04:01.695
- Going down?

983
01:04:01.715 --> 01:04:04.382
- No, I better finish up here.

984
01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.220
- See you later.

985
01:04:10.632 --> 01:04:12.223
(suspenseful music)

986
01:04:16.804 --> 01:04:17.804
(sighs)

987
01:04:24.905 --> 01:04:27.186
- You have your meeting
with lorenzo today, right?

988
01:04:27.574 --> 01:04:28.798
- Unfortunately.

989
01:04:29.134 --> 01:04:29.890
- No, this is good.

990
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.558
What you found in his schedule

991
01:04:31.653 --> 01:04:32.301
Proves that he was trying

992
01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:32.911
To cover up the fact

993
01:04:33.062 --> 01:04:34.228
That he was in town

994
01:04:34.322 --> 01:04:35.229
When your mom was killed.

995
01:04:35.323 --> 01:04:36.472
- Yeah, but how am I just

996
01:04:36.491 --> 01:04:37.771
Supposed to ask him about that?

997
01:04:38.919 --> 01:04:40.401
- You can't, not outright,
but having a one-on-one

998
01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.920
Conversation is a good start.

999
01:04:43.148 --> 01:04:44.458
See if you can get him
to talk about allie.

1000
01:04:44.482 --> 01:04:45.072
- Allie?

1001
01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:46.240
- Yeah, you said they had

1002
01:04:46.259 --> 01:04:47.574
A private meeting.

1003
01:04:47.669 --> 01:04:48.887
- Yeah, one she claimed to have

1004
01:04:48.911 --> 01:04:50.244
Signed an nda for.

1005
01:04:50.263 --> 01:04:51.966
- See if he'll say
anything else about it.

1006
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.467
- Find out what their
relationship is.

1007
01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:54.491
- Okay.

1008
01:04:56.102 --> 01:04:57.769
(mysterious music)

1009
01:05:01.332 --> 01:05:02.774
(sighs)

1010
01:05:16.122 --> 01:05:17.288
- Come in!

1011
01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:22.535
Come on in. Close
the door, please.

1012
01:05:24.113 --> 01:05:25.153
Have a seat, elena.

1013
01:05:28.376 --> 01:05:29.656
Do you want something to drink?

1014
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:32.029
- I'm fine.

1015
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:36.957
Thank you. For
doing this, I mean.

1016
01:05:37.702 --> 01:05:38.476
- It's important to me that my

1017
01:05:38.703 --> 01:05:40.605
Employees feel
like they know me.

1018
01:05:40.629 --> 01:05:43.206
That they can come to me
at any time for any reason.

1019
01:05:43.224 --> 01:05:45.110
- People seem to
enjoy working for you.

1020
01:05:45.134 --> 01:05:47.727
Like allie, for example.

1021
01:05:47.879 --> 01:05:51.063
I mean, I'm guessing she's been
working for you for a while

1022
01:05:51.216 --> 01:05:53.825
If you trust her enough with
an important side project.

1023
01:05:53.976 --> 01:05:55.118
- Loyalty.

1024
01:05:56.054 --> 01:05:57.161
You can't buy that.

1025
01:05:57.313 --> 01:05:59.388
Well, actually, you can.

1026
01:05:59.407 --> 01:06:00.389
(chuckling)

1027
01:06:00.408 --> 01:06:02.316
So, never mind.

1028
01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:04.744
What about you,
where'd you grow up?

1029
01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:09.582
- Uh... I grew up in the
midwest, but most of my family

1030
01:06:09.676 --> 01:06:11.654
Lives on the east coast,
that's why I moved out here.

1031
01:06:11.678 --> 01:06:12.678
- Your parents?

1032
01:06:14.848 --> 01:06:18.850
- My mother passed away
and I never knew my father.

1033
01:06:20.928 --> 01:06:21.928
- You're like me.

1034
01:06:23.172 --> 01:06:25.005
My mother died when I was young,

1035
01:06:25.025 --> 01:06:27.025
My father was never
in the picture.

1036
01:06:27.676 --> 01:06:29.246
It's hard in life
without having someone

1037
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:30.611
To guide you to the right path.

1038
01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:34.330
- You seem to have done
pretty well for yourself.

1039
01:06:34.683 --> 01:06:37.260
- Yeah, I'm doing well now.

1040
01:06:37.278 --> 01:06:39.262
But it's been a long road
to get here, a lot of bumps,

1041
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.496
Lot of dead ends.

1042
01:06:41.449 --> 01:06:42.649
- How'd you turn it around?

1043
01:06:44.285 --> 01:06:48.195
- First, I had to figure out
who I was, but once I did that,

1044
01:06:48.214 --> 01:06:50.084
I realized that I was
good at something:

1045
01:06:50.108 --> 01:06:51.108
Business.

1046
01:06:52.535 --> 01:06:54.346
If I could put that to work
for me in the right way,

1047
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:56.330
I knew that I could
be successful.

1048
01:06:56.556 --> 01:06:58.592
- You seem to have
it all figured out.

1049
01:06:58.616 --> 01:06:59.615
(chuckling)

1050
01:06:59.634 --> 01:07:00.892
- Not quite.

1051
01:07:02.062 --> 01:07:03.561
What about you, elena?

1052
01:07:03.788 --> 01:07:04.948
I'm getting the sense
that you don't like

1053
01:07:04.972 --> 01:07:06.305
Talking about yourself.

1054
01:07:06.882 --> 01:07:08.399
- I'm not that interesting.

1055
01:07:10.904 --> 01:07:12.070
- What is it you want?

1056
01:07:14.056 --> 01:07:15.198
What are you doing here?

1057
01:07:16.076 --> 01:07:17.724
Why work at l.B. Corp?

1058
01:07:18.912 --> 01:07:21.537
- It's a great company
with lots of opportunities.

1059
01:07:22.082 --> 01:07:23.414
- I know that,

1060
01:07:25.234 --> 01:07:26.417
But what do you want?

1061
01:07:28.663 --> 01:07:29.995
- What do I want from you?

1062
01:07:30.148 --> 01:07:31.756
- Be honest.

1063
01:07:38.656 --> 01:07:40.723
- You really want
to know about me?

1064
01:07:42.677 --> 01:07:45.419
- My name is elena russo.

1065
01:07:45.438 --> 01:07:48.422
My mother was teresa russo,
she was murdered the day that

1066
01:07:48.441 --> 01:07:49.721
She came to visit my grandmother

1067
01:07:49.758 --> 01:07:51.758
After hiding from
you for 21 years.

1068
01:07:52.278 --> 01:07:55.113
You are my father and
I think you killed her.

1069
01:07:56.674 --> 01:07:57.740
- Elena!

1070
01:07:58.934 --> 01:08:00.526
- You can't run in here!

1071
01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.620
- Elena, stop!

1072
01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:04.956
(suspenseful music)

1073
01:08:07.685 --> 01:08:09.085
Elena!

1074
01:08:10.964 --> 01:08:12.630
Elena!

1075
01:08:13.299 --> 01:08:17.135
(eerie music)

1076
01:08:42.811 --> 01:08:46.831
(suspenseful music)

1077
01:09:19.257 --> 01:09:21.440
- Come on... Answer!

1078
01:09:21.592 --> 01:09:23.534
(whimpering)

1079
01:09:24.704 --> 01:09:25.704
(tires screeching)

1080
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:46.950
Allie!

1081
01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.899
- Freeze, drop your weapon!

1082
01:09:55.902 --> 01:09:56.902
(grunting)

1083
01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:01.072
(whimpering)

1084
01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:06.411
Are you alright?

1085
01:10:07.805 --> 01:10:08.805
- I'm okay.

1086
01:10:09.474 --> 01:10:10.748
What just happened?

1087
01:10:11.584 --> 01:10:12.584
- We got her.

1088
01:10:13.253 --> 01:10:14.253
Can you stand?

1089
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:17.071
- Come on.

1090
01:10:17.482 --> 01:10:18.482
Come on.

1091
01:10:21.986 --> 01:10:23.594
Damn it!

1092
01:10:31.938 --> 01:10:32.938
- Is that blood?

1093
01:10:33.088 --> 01:10:33.754
- Uh, huh.

1094
01:10:33.848 --> 01:10:35.606
- Oh god, where is she?

1095
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:38.110
- She's gone.

1096
01:10:42.264 --> 01:10:44.115
- That's her phone.

1097
01:10:48.863 --> 01:10:50.246
- It's evidence now.

1098
01:11:01.301 --> 01:11:04.302
Come on, let's get
you some place safe.

1099
01:11:06.864 --> 01:11:08.097
Stay close.

1100
01:11:23.397 --> 01:11:25.557
- I can't believe you
were right about her.

1101
01:11:25.808 --> 01:11:27.768
- You're in shock,
you should rest.

1102
01:11:28.811 --> 01:11:31.236
- Do you think she's
acting for lorenzo?

1103
01:11:31.331 --> 01:11:33.691
- We can't say until there's
a thorough investigation.

1104
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:35.391
We need to get her in custody.

1105
01:11:35.484 --> 01:11:36.892
Until that's done, I'm afraid

1106
01:11:36.911 --> 01:11:38.191
You'll have to keep laying low.

1107
01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.340
- I...

1108
01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:45.676
That might be tough after
what happened today at work.

1109
01:11:46.346 --> 01:11:47.346
- What happened?

1110
01:11:49.407 --> 01:11:51.527
- You know how I was
meeting with lorenzo?

1111
01:11:52.518 --> 01:11:55.186
Well, he kept asking me
questions, prying and eventually

1112
01:11:55.413 --> 01:11:58.481
I just snapped and I
told him everything.

1113
01:11:59.508 --> 01:12:00.691
- What's everything?

1114
01:12:03.363 --> 01:12:06.864
- I told him who I am and
that I think he killed my mom.

1115
01:12:07.608 --> 01:12:08.608
- Holy...

1116
01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:10.183
- I know.

1117
01:12:10.277 --> 01:12:12.664
I know I shouldn't have let my
emotions get the better of me

1118
01:12:12.688 --> 01:12:14.113
But you should have seen him.

1119
01:12:14.949 --> 01:12:18.024
He paints himself out to be
some nice guy then he acts

1120
01:12:18.119 --> 01:12:21.212
Like he wants to help everyone
but I know he's a killer and...

1121
01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:25.716
She's probably working for him.

1122
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:30.221
And I was their special project.

1123
01:12:30.448 --> 01:12:31.942
- We don't have
proof of that yet.

1124
01:12:31.966 --> 01:12:33.224
- You have allie's phone,

1125
01:12:34.209 --> 01:12:36.096
There's probably
something on there.

1126
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.286
- Yes, you're right.

1127
01:12:38.564 --> 01:12:40.283
I'll have to get to the lab
for processing but it'll take

1128
01:12:40.307 --> 01:12:41.467
Time, which we don't have.

1129
01:12:43.144 --> 01:12:44.902
- I'm so sorry.

1130
01:12:45.905 --> 01:12:48.297
I screwed everything up today.

1131
01:12:48.315 --> 01:12:53.411
- No, you did the opposite, you
brought us a break in the case.

1132
01:12:53.562 --> 01:12:55.562
We have a lot for
our team to go on.

1133
01:13:00.903 --> 01:13:03.087
- What if we turn the
tables on lorenzo?

1134
01:13:03.756 --> 01:13:04.997
- What do you mean?

1135
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:06.382
- Well...

1136
01:13:07.985 --> 01:13:10.065
What if we asked him
for another meeting?

1137
01:13:10.579 --> 01:13:11.887
One we could record.

1138
01:13:13.599 --> 01:13:14.599
- It could work.

1139
01:13:16.177 --> 01:13:18.488
We could play the allie's
phone card, make it sound like

1140
01:13:18.512 --> 01:13:21.180
We found something on it,
something incriminating to him.

1141
01:13:21.274 --> 01:13:22.918
- We'll do it at jackie's
place, I'll set it up.

1142
01:13:22.942 --> 01:13:23.942
- Wait.

1143
01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:25.851
If we do this, we have to think

1144
01:13:26.003 --> 01:13:28.094
It through, every detail.

1145
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:30.651
The last thing I want to do is
put you in even more danger,

1146
01:13:30.675 --> 01:13:32.795
Especially with allie
still on the loose.

1147
01:13:32.843 --> 01:13:35.744
- We have to do this,
it's our only shot.

1148
01:13:37.181 --> 01:13:39.248
Look, you saved my life today.

1149
01:13:40.534 --> 01:13:42.626
I won't be reckless.

1150
01:13:45.022 --> 01:13:46.130
- Good.

1151
01:13:49.193 --> 01:13:50.468
- So is that a yes?

1152
01:14:00.705 --> 01:14:01.705
(sighing)

1153
01:14:01.872 --> 01:14:02.872
- Ready?

1154
01:14:03.799 --> 01:14:05.390
- I'm nervous.

1155
01:14:05.543 --> 01:14:07.226
- Oh...

1156
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.895
Hey, is that thing live?

1157
01:14:10.047 --> 01:14:11.047
- Yeah.

1158
01:14:11.882 --> 01:14:15.400
- Wow, big brother
in my own house.

1159
01:14:16.144 --> 01:14:19.663
- I really appreciate
you doing this, jackie.

1160
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.741
- For you and teresa?

1161
01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:23.893
Anything.

1162
01:14:28.341 --> 01:14:30.486
- Is that clock right?
Because he was supposed

1163
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:33.569
To be here at seven o'clock.
What if he's not coming?

1164
01:14:33.587 --> 01:14:35.921
- There are a million
reasons why he could be late.

1165
01:14:36.015 --> 01:14:38.516
Here, drink this.

1166
01:14:41.078 --> 01:14:41.685
Go on,

1167
01:14:41.837 --> 01:14:42.853
<i>Bottoms up.</i>

1168
01:14:43.764 --> 01:14:44.596
- Easy on the wine.

1169
01:14:44.749 --> 01:14:45.817
<i>(elena): Do you think he's late</i>

1170
01:14:45.841 --> 01:14:46.506
Because of traffic?

1171
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.340
<i>(jackie): Definitely,</i>

1172
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.508
<i>It's always traffic.</i>

1173
01:14:48.528 --> 01:14:49.676
(phone ringing)

1174
01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:50.602
<i>There's construction,</i>

1175
01:14:50.755 --> 01:14:51.603
<i>Have you been on the turnpike?</i>

1176
01:14:51.756 --> 01:14:52.421
- Carter.

1177
01:14:52.439 --> 01:14:53.346
<i>(elena): I don't know,</i>

1178
01:14:53.366 --> 01:14:54.347
<i>Have you taken me there yet?</i>

1179
01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:55.736
- Yes. <i>(jackie): I have.</i>

1180
01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.513
<i>(elena): Is traffic
bad in new jersey?</i>

1181
01:14:57.537 --> 01:14:58.537
- What's that?

1182
01:14:59.705 --> 01:15:00.832
<i>(jackie): Construction,
people, cars.</i>

1183
01:15:00.856 --> 01:15:03.448
<i>Everyone's got
two cars now, why?</i>

1184
01:15:03.601 --> 01:15:05.358
(suspenseful music)

1185
01:15:05.452 --> 01:15:06.935
<i>Traffic after seven.</i>

1186
01:15:07.029 --> 01:15:08.229
- Have you id'd the victim?

1187
01:15:12.793 --> 01:15:13.884
Is he dead?

1188
01:15:16.447 --> 01:15:17.513
I'll meet you there.

1189
01:15:25.306 --> 01:15:26.564
(engine starting)

1190
01:15:29.293 --> 01:15:30.309
(sighing)

1191
01:15:30.461 --> 01:15:31.551
- What's up?

1192
01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:32.571
- He's not coming.

1193
01:15:34.131 --> 01:15:36.291
I was stupid to think
that this could work.

1194
01:15:37.134 --> 01:15:38.409
- You're not stupid.

1195
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:43.706
You can't control chaos and
lorenzo's nothing but chaos.

1196
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:47.751
- Um, no.

1197
01:15:48.737 --> 01:15:50.754
I wouldn't describe him as that.

1198
01:15:50.906 --> 01:15:52.590
He's more calculated.

1199
01:15:52.817 --> 01:15:53.817
- Trust me.

1200
01:15:57.746 --> 01:16:00.598
- How do you know so much
about lorenzo anyway?

1201
01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:04.101
- I used to know him quite well,

1202
01:16:04.252 --> 01:16:05.677
Better than anyone.

1203
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:10.423
And he knew me too,

1204
01:16:10.443 --> 01:16:14.111
Like, really knew me.

1205
01:16:14.262 --> 01:16:16.780
What we had was special.

1206
01:16:18.284 --> 01:16:21.952
Until teresa had to
come and ruin it!

1207
01:16:22.622 --> 01:16:25.514
- What... What are you doing?

1208
01:16:25.532 --> 01:16:27.032
- You wanted answers, right?

1209
01:16:27.184 --> 01:16:28.684
I mean, that's why we're here.

1210
01:16:28.702 --> 01:16:31.370
Ooh, are you feeling
a little foggy?

1211
01:16:31.522 --> 01:16:32.522
- Mm-hmm.

1212
01:16:33.949 --> 01:16:36.449
- 'cause I gave you my special
vintage, I put a little

1213
01:16:36.469 --> 01:16:38.043
Something extra in it for you.

1214
01:16:38.195 --> 01:16:39.195
(gasping)

1215
01:16:41.866 --> 01:16:47.219
Lorenzo had an annoying
soft spot for teresa,

1216
01:16:47.313 --> 01:16:50.372
But not even she could
compete with what we had.

1217
01:16:51.542 --> 01:16:54.376
I guess that's why she had
to go get herself knocked up.

1218
01:16:54.395 --> 01:16:55.060
(groaning)

1219
01:16:55.154 --> 01:16:56.803
Listen to me!

1220
01:16:56.822 --> 01:16:59.323
This is important!

1221
01:16:59.550 --> 01:17:04.069
I was loyal to him,
even after what she did!

1222
01:17:04.163 --> 01:17:08.332
I gave him everything,
even a daughter of our own!

1223
01:17:09.168 --> 01:17:10.501
- A daughter?

1224
01:17:12.246 --> 01:17:15.230
- I wanted him to know how much
I loved him but he was always

1225
01:17:15.323 --> 01:17:18.233
Fixated on what
he couldn't have:

1226
01:17:18.252 --> 01:17:20.736
Teresa and you.

1227
01:17:21.238 --> 01:17:23.422
He became obsessed.

1228
01:17:23.516 --> 01:17:26.091
He started visiting sofia
with the hope that the bitch

1229
01:17:26.243 --> 01:17:27.685
Would come and visit one day.

1230
01:17:29.171 --> 01:17:31.355
To be fair, she finally did.

1231
01:17:33.675 --> 01:17:34.358
(groaning)

1232
01:17:34.585 --> 01:17:35.693
Wake up!

1233
01:17:37.254 --> 01:17:39.530
- You and my mom
weren't friends?

1234
01:17:40.015 --> 01:17:44.368
- Oh, we were at a certain
point, but after the accident,

1235
01:17:44.519 --> 01:17:46.778
I mean, things could
never be the same.

1236
01:17:46.872 --> 01:17:48.038
We both moved on.

1237
01:17:50.859 --> 01:17:52.876
We just moved on
with the same guy.

1238
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:56.213
- Where's your daughter now?

1239
01:17:56.716 --> 01:17:58.674
- Oh, you met her.

1240
01:17:59.534 --> 01:18:01.719
My beautiful, allie.

1241
01:18:02.963 --> 01:18:05.447
(whimpering)

1242
01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.391
Oh, no, no, no.

1243
01:18:08.635 --> 01:18:10.953
I can't let you call carter.

1244
01:18:10.971 --> 01:18:12.637
I'll take care of him next.

1245
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:14.565
(laboured breathing)

1246
01:18:14.792 --> 01:18:18.193
The same way I dealt
with lorenzo and teresa.

1247
01:18:23.801 --> 01:18:25.492
- You killed my mom?

1248
01:18:26.637 --> 01:18:28.971
- She got what
was coming to her.

1249
01:18:28.989 --> 01:18:32.374
Like mother, like daughter.

1250
01:18:42.486 --> 01:18:44.314
- Seems like a
lover's spat to me.

1251
01:18:44.338 --> 01:18:45.003
- How do you figure?

1252
01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:46.321
- Final text on his phone

1253
01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.431
Says it all.

1254
01:18:54.665 --> 01:18:56.089
- Did you run a
trace on the number?

1255
01:18:56.108 --> 01:18:57.994
- Unregistered,
it's a burner phone,

1256
01:18:58.018 --> 01:18:59.087
But there is something else.

1257
01:18:59.111 --> 01:19:00.111
Excuse me.

1258
01:19:01.763 --> 01:19:04.448
Vape pen, we found this
under the passenger seat,

1259
01:19:04.675 --> 01:19:05.524
Must have fallen
between the cracks.

1260
01:19:05.618 --> 01:19:06.508
We swabbed it for dna,

1261
01:19:06.601 --> 01:19:07.801
The lab's working on it now.

1262
01:19:10.772 --> 01:19:12.272
- Call me with the result,

1263
01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.417
Keep me posted on
the victim's status.

1264
01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:14.441
- Will do.

1265
01:19:28.382 --> 01:19:30.808
(mysterious music)

1266
01:19:32.886 --> 01:19:33.977
(tires screeching)

1267
01:19:35.556 --> 01:19:36.647
- Why do all this?

1268
01:19:37.891 --> 01:19:40.392
- Teresa put lorenzo
away for years.

1269
01:19:40.486 --> 01:19:43.403
That was years away
from my daughter's life!

1270
01:19:45.899 --> 01:19:48.641
Why did he think
that barista job

1271
01:19:48.661 --> 01:19:49.326
Would make up for everything...

1272
01:19:49.553 --> 01:19:50.911
(screaming)

1273
01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.833
- You and your mother
ruined our lives!

1274
01:19:55.984 --> 01:19:58.168
(screaming)

1275
01:20:00.581 --> 01:20:02.506
(phone ringing)

1276
01:20:03.325 --> 01:20:04.082
What was that?

1277
01:20:04.234 --> 01:20:05.734
Oh!

1278
01:20:05.827 --> 01:20:07.638
It's your little
rent-a-cop friend,

1279
01:20:07.662 --> 01:20:09.404
Looks like he's on his way back.

1280
01:20:09.497 --> 01:20:10.848
Do you want me to respond?

1281
01:20:11.075 --> 01:20:13.016
(screaming)

1282
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.780
(clanking)

1283
01:20:27.758 --> 01:20:28.758
(screaming)

1284
01:20:36.876 --> 01:20:38.524
(panting)

1285
01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:39.793
(mysterious music)

1286
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:50.888
(suspenseful music)

1287
01:20:56.453 --> 01:20:59.229
(whimpering)

1288
01:21:00.065 --> 01:21:01.732
(engine starting)

1289
01:21:02.717 --> 01:21:04.142
(screaming)

1290
01:21:04.236 --> 01:21:05.819
(tires screeching)

1291
01:21:41.682 --> 01:21:43.690
- Elena, are you alright?

1292
01:21:44.443 --> 01:21:45.443
- Uh-huh.

1293
01:21:47.446 --> 01:21:48.594
Is she...

1294
01:21:48.614 --> 01:21:49.614
- She's dead.

1295
01:21:52.451 --> 01:21:54.117
- No...

1296
01:21:55.788 --> 01:21:57.120
Mom...

1297
01:21:58.865 --> 01:22:00.791
(whimpering)

1298
01:22:10.785 --> 01:22:14.721
- Allison armstrong, you have
the right to remain silent.

1299
01:22:16.366 --> 01:22:19.384
Anything you say can
and will be used against

1300
01:22:19.478 --> 01:22:20.558
You in a court of law.

1301
01:22:31.639 --> 01:22:33.073
(grunting)

1302
01:22:47.989 --> 01:22:48.989
You alright?

1303
01:22:50.567 --> 01:22:51.675
- Yeah.

1304
01:22:52.736 --> 01:22:54.177
Any news about my dad?

1305
01:22:54.755 --> 01:22:56.795
- Looks like he's
gonna pull through.

1306
01:22:59.334 --> 01:23:02.744
- Well, I have to head
out, new case assignment.

1307
01:23:03.263 --> 01:23:04.579
- They'll be lucky to have you.

1308
01:23:04.672 --> 01:23:06.953
- I wish you'd consider
joining the program but...

1309
01:23:09.253 --> 01:23:10.672
You'll keep in touch?
Text me, let me know

1310
01:23:10.696 --> 01:23:11.696
How you're doing.

1311
01:23:11.772 --> 01:23:12.812
- I will, I promise.

1312
01:23:15.367 --> 01:23:19.036
- Oh, and elena, if you
ever need anything...

1313
01:23:19.763 --> 01:23:21.038
(soft music)

1314
01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:26.877
- Thank you.

1315
01:23:28.105 --> 01:23:29.105
- Thank you.

1316
01:23:47.808 --> 01:23:49.399
- Do you mind if I join you?

1317
01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:55.489
Alright, thanks.

1318
01:23:59.986 --> 01:24:03.830
I want to say I'm sorry, for
everything that's happened,

1319
01:24:04.583 --> 01:24:06.249
Especially with allie.

1320
01:24:08.662 --> 01:24:14.091
I knew jackie had been feeding
her lies for years but I didn't

1321
01:24:14.318 --> 01:24:16.278
Realize how bad
things had gotten.

1322
01:24:16.578 --> 01:24:19.654
- Maybe, serving time will do

1323
01:24:19.747 --> 01:24:21.707
Her some good like
it did for you.

1324
01:24:22.768 --> 01:24:24.008
It changed your life.

1325
01:24:24.494 --> 01:24:25.936
- I hope so.

1326
01:24:27.088 --> 01:24:28.772
(soft music)

1327
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:32.110
- What is it?

1328
01:24:33.779 --> 01:24:35.946
- You look so much like teresa.

1329
01:24:45.182 --> 01:24:47.457
- I saw a video of you
harassing her at sofia's

1330
01:24:47.609 --> 01:24:52.129
House and that was the
last day she was alive.

1331
01:24:55.783 --> 01:24:57.428
- I went there to
feed sofia's cat.

1332
01:24:57.452 --> 01:24:59.694
I've been taking care
of her ever since sofia

1333
01:24:59.713 --> 01:25:01.221
Went into the hospital.

1334
01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.475
I never expected to
see teresa there.

1335
01:25:06.645 --> 01:25:09.479
I just wanted to
talk to her, but...

1336
01:25:14.211 --> 01:25:16.820
I know it's my fault
because of who I was

1337
01:25:16.971 --> 01:25:19.156
And how I treated
teresa back then.

1338
01:25:20.384 --> 01:25:22.344
I didn't deserve
anything from her.

1339
01:25:22.886 --> 01:25:25.006
I don't deserve anything
from you either.

1340
01:25:26.314 --> 01:25:28.999
(laboured breathing)

1341
01:25:34.581 --> 01:25:36.006
(gasps)

1342
01:25:41.254 --> 01:25:42.679
- Is this a dream?

1343
01:25:44.516 --> 01:25:45.516
- It's all real.

1344
01:25:46.351 --> 01:25:48.185
I'm right here, grandma.

1345
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:54.357
- Pretty girl, tell
me... Tell me everything.

1346
01:26:02.609 --> 01:26:05.952
- Well, my name is elena.

1347
01:26:08.207 --> 01:26:11.208
Elena sofia, actually.

1348
01:26:13.695 --> 01:26:16.862
I was born October 14, 2001.

1349
01:26:17.274 --> 01:26:18.882
Mom and I lived in cincinnati,

1350
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:21.718
It was always just
the two of us.

1351
01:26:23.447 --> 01:26:26.890
And she really was the best.

1352
01:26:27.559 --> 01:26:30.393
(♪♪)

1353
01:26:32.731 --> 01:26:33.731
