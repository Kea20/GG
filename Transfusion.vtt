00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.430
- Friendly friendly.
- Friendly.

2
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.330
This is you, yeah? Ali Abdul?

3
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.970
Yeah, yeah.
This is you.

4
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.650
This is you. No
more war for you.

5
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.970
Alright. Got my
jackpot, brother.

6
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.767
Zero
alpha this is one-three.

7
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:34.350
Who the fuck is this
person? Who is this person?

8
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.130
Where's this fucking person?

9
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.846
Where is this man?

10
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.230
Get down. Get down.

11
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.669
Hey. Son, son, son, son.

12
00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.269
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.210
You silly fucker, you've
gone and got yourself shot.

14
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.370
You're alright. You're alright.
Might need a medic. Logan's hit.

15
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.450
You're alright, mate.
Look at me, look at me.

16
00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.645
You're alright, they're coming,
they're coming. Look at me.

17
00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.149
You're 'right, you're 'right.
You're not gunna die here son.

18
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.089
Dad.

19
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.169
OK.

20
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.270
Take it.

21
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.590
And take the shot.

22
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.070
I don't want to.

23
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.508
Come here.

24
00:06:54.508 --> 00:06:56.728
Here. Sit there.

25
00:06:56.828 --> 00:06:58.828
Oi, hold this.

26
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.469
OK. Flat to the stone.

27
00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.349
And you're gonna pull it back.

28
00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:11.248
Come here. Try again.
Put the pressure on.

29
00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.349
Just guide it.

30
00:07:15.828 --> 00:07:17.829
There you are. OK.

31
00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:29.028
Ow.

32
00:07:29.388 --> 00:07:31.388
All good.

33
00:07:33.028 --> 00:07:34.968
It's OK.

34
00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:37.108
Don't want to lose any of
the golden blood, yeah?

35
00:09:16.308 --> 00:09:17.367
Dad!

36
00:09:17.467 --> 00:09:18.527
Dad!

37
00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:04.707
You want to steer
us out of here?

38
00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:13.547
Ready?

39
00:10:49.147 --> 00:10:51.506
Oh!

40
00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:05.527
You have a good time today?

41
00:11:05.628 --> 00:11:07.628
- The best.
- Yeah?

42
00:11:13.347 --> 00:11:15.347
Ouch.

43
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:18.066
Hmm.

44
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.206
Did you eat some fish?

45
00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.086
No. Deer.

46
00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:24.286
So good.

47
00:11:45.187 --> 00:11:47.165
What happened to his finger?

48
00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:49.526
What was that?

49
00:11:49.627 --> 00:11:51.166
What happened to his finger?

50
00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:53.366
Oh, it's just a nick.

51
00:11:53.467 --> 00:11:55.647
He'll be fine.

52
00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:57.747
Hey.

53
00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:00.647
How are you feeling?

54
00:12:00.747 --> 00:12:02.166
- Fat.
- Yeah?

55
00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:03.366
Mm-hm.

56
00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:05.467
Want me to sand
it a little back?

57
00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:09.286
How are you doing in there?

58
00:12:09.387 --> 00:12:10.647
Doing OK? She's not moving.

59
00:12:10.747 --> 00:12:12.747
She's asleep.

60
00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:15.446
OK.

61
00:12:15.546 --> 00:12:18.986
That's a wonderful thought.
Sleep inside of you.

62
00:12:21.226 --> 00:12:23.226
How's it coming along?

63
00:12:24.706 --> 00:12:26.965
Yeah, it's good. Be finished
by the time she's 16.

64
00:12:35.987 --> 00:12:37.987
Hey.

65
00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:40.826
Gotta go to bed.

66
00:12:42.467 --> 00:12:44.766
Did you have a good
time with me camping?

67
00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:46.866
Yeah.

68
00:12:47.427 --> 00:12:49.427
Yeah, I did too.

69
00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:56.865
What is it?

70
00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:01.546
Will I be brave
like you one day?

71
00:13:03.186 --> 00:13:05.186
Like me?

72
00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:10.546
There's many ways to be brave.

73
00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:14.266
Like…

74
00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:17.585
like remember when I told you
to shoot the deer, you said no?

75
00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:22.086
And when you said that,

76
00:13:22.187 --> 00:13:25.105
you were kind of scared that
you were gonna disappoint me.

77
00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.706
But you said it anyway.

78
00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:31.986
That's being brave.

79
00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:39.605
Get some sleep.

80
00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:41.324
Get some sleep.

81
00:13:41.424 --> 00:13:42.885
Ah, get in.

82
00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:44.986
Tuck you in like a burrito!

83
00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:48.485
Ouch.

84
00:13:48.585 --> 00:13:50.585
It's hot.

85
00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:53.285
I heated it up a bit.

86
00:13:53.385 --> 00:13:55.466
Are you
trying to cook me?

87
00:13:57.624 --> 00:13:59.624
- Like this?
- Yeah.

88
00:14:00.825 --> 00:14:02.444
And what is this
meant to do again?

89
00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:04.885
Um…

90
00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:07.066
supposed to prevent
stretch marks.

91
00:14:08.465 --> 00:14:09.925
Yeah, not working.

92
00:14:10.026 --> 00:14:12.026
Fuck you.

93
00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:14.005
OK here.

94
00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.685
Shh.

95
00:15:17.065 --> 00:15:18.724
Is it time to get up?

96
00:15:18.825 --> 00:15:20.684
Sh…sh…
Mummy's asleep.

97
00:15:20.785 --> 00:15:23.204
OK. Come here. Come here.

98
00:15:25.145 --> 00:15:26.403
Yeah. Cool. OK.

99
00:15:26.503 --> 00:15:28.644
Don't look. What's
in your sandwich?

100
00:15:28.744 --> 00:15:30.285
Jam?

101
00:15:36.984 --> 00:15:39.264
- Chicken?
- Yes!

102
00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.176
Remember what to do?

103
00:15:47.744 --> 00:15:49.923
Got to do it nice and
gentle. Nice and gentle.

104
00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:53.092
Squeeze it tight. Tight.
There you go! That's the one.

105
00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:02.124
- Kelly?
- Nup.

106
00:16:02.224 --> 00:16:04.325
- Kelly, that's nice.
- Nup.

107
00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:05.384
Okay?

108
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:06.950
- Um…
- Ah…

109
00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:08.273
Kiana.

110
00:16:08.298 --> 00:16:10.198
- Kiana?
- Yeah.

111
00:16:10.223 --> 00:16:11.839
- That's not a name.
- Yes it is.

112
00:16:11.864 --> 00:16:13.199
- You made it up.
- That's your friend...

113
00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.543
No, it's your
friend from netball.

114
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:16.589
Kiana.

115
00:16:16.614 --> 00:16:21.044
The tall one. Goal…goalkeeper.
Goal attack. GA.

116
00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:22.684
Kiani.

117
00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:24.284
Not Kiana, Kiani.

118
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:25.684
I've been calling her Kiana.

119
00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:28.004
Oh, that's her…
that's the wrong name.

120
00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:30.085
Why hasn't she said anything?

121
00:16:30.185 --> 00:16:32.004
Who calls themself Kiani?
What does that mean?

122
00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:34.364
Honey, you're such an asshole.

123
00:16:34.464 --> 00:16:35.801
Why am I an asshole?
She's the one…

124
00:16:35.825 --> 00:16:37.164
- This whole time?
- You'd think…

125
00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:39.404
My name… Sorry, you've been
calling me the wrong name.

126
00:16:39.504 --> 00:16:40.683
My name is Kiani.

127
00:17:18.664 --> 00:17:21.464
You got any idea what you're
gonna say to these kids?

128
00:17:22.343 --> 00:17:23.883
I got no idea.

129
00:17:25.863 --> 00:17:28.083
Probably the same shit
you dribbled to me.

130
00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:30.184
Yeah.

131
00:17:30.617 --> 00:17:32.617
Just be honest, son.

132
00:17:34.597 --> 00:17:36.216
No, we're all just men.

133
00:17:36.303 --> 00:17:38.202
None of us is Superman.

134
00:17:38.283 --> 00:17:40.503
We're not made of steel.
We're not invincible.

135
00:17:41.231 --> 00:17:43.884
Just trying to walk a line
between courage and fear.

136
00:17:45.463 --> 00:17:47.442
Pure courage is…

137
00:17:47.643 --> 00:17:50.023
taking on a task that
you're ill equipped to do.

138
00:17:50.993 --> 00:17:52.484
The job of the instructors here

139
00:17:52.584 --> 00:17:54.563
is to equip you
for any situation

140
00:17:54.663 --> 00:17:56.363
you find yourself in
the field of duty.

141
00:17:58.308 --> 00:18:01.065
We minimise the fear by
the repetition of training.

142
00:18:04.744 --> 00:18:07.552
Pure courage is minimised…

143
00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.363
because it needs to be.

144
00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.724
Because in the face of fear
your actions and decisions

145
00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:13.283
can be compromised.

146
00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:18.204
And you're in near
the end? Right?

147
00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:19.882
- Right?
- Yeah.

148
00:18:19.907 --> 00:18:21.564
Yeah.

149
00:18:22.303 --> 00:18:23.362
That's good.

150
00:18:23.462 --> 00:18:25.319
But we're still gonna push
you physically and mentally

151
00:18:25.343 --> 00:18:27.343
harder than you ever
thought possible.

152
00:18:27.823 --> 00:18:29.823
You just gotta keep your line.

153
00:18:30.248 --> 00:18:31.723
You just gotta keep the line.

154
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.670
Just gotta try and
keep your line.

155
00:18:45.784 --> 00:18:46.963
That's it.

156
00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.442
Mate, are you right?

157
00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:03.362
Ambulance. Yeah.

158
00:19:52.863 --> 00:19:54.863
Just please don't go.

159
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.094
When then?

160
00:20:19.949 --> 00:20:22.288
And just as a
final thought, Your Honour,

161
00:20:22.374 --> 00:20:23.958
I'd ask you to take
into consideration

162
00:20:23.982 --> 00:20:27.262
the upheaval this young man has
faced over the past seven years.

163
00:20:28.108 --> 00:20:29.967
He's been to six schools.

164
00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:32.618
Lived in Brisbane, Adelaide,
Perth and now here.

165
00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:35.624
And what are the
reasons for that?

166
00:20:36.316 --> 00:20:38.196
His father, Your Honour,
has had trouble finding

167
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:40.573
fulfilling employment
since leaving the army.

168
00:20:42.893 --> 00:20:45.674
- Is your father here, son?
- Yes, Your Honour.

169
00:20:46.741 --> 00:20:48.058
Mr Logan?

170
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.430
Yes, Your Honour?

171
00:20:53.969 --> 00:20:57.913
So did you see active
service, Mr Logan?

172
00:20:57.938 --> 00:20:59.037
Yes, Your Honour.

173
00:20:59.062 --> 00:21:03.127
Well, I had an uncle in the
Army, served in Vietnam…

174
00:21:04.982 --> 00:21:08.362
He…well, he struggled
in the years after.

175
00:21:08.462 --> 00:21:09.429
I'm fine, Your Honour.

176
00:21:09.454 --> 00:21:11.594
Now, hear me out, Mr Logan.

177
00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:13.961
Now, look, I have read
over your son's offences.

178
00:21:14.061 --> 00:21:17.241
Now this is the third time
that he's appeared here.

179
00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:21.561
It was stealing, drug possession
and now destruction of property.

180
00:21:21.662 --> 00:21:24.041
And all occasions he's been
picked up by the police

181
00:21:24.142 --> 00:21:25.721
after some days
away from your care,

182
00:21:25.821 --> 00:21:27.721
that being, he's run away.

183
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:29.961
And I also read here that
his mother passed away

184
00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:32.061
eight years ago,
so it's only you?

185
00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:37.020
Yes, Your Honour.

186
00:21:38.742 --> 00:21:40.961
Mr Logan, I sympathise
with your situation.

187
00:21:41.061 --> 00:21:42.961
I've seen your
struggle firsthand.

188
00:21:42.986 --> 00:21:44.886
You're also a single parent,

189
00:21:44.911 --> 00:21:47.201
but the situation
with your son is dire.

190
00:21:47.301 --> 00:21:50.361
And by that, I mean, if he
appears before this court again,

191
00:21:50.462 --> 00:21:52.982
he'll either be sent away
or taken from your care.

192
00:21:53.662 --> 00:21:55.041
Now that's the process.

193
00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:56.685
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

194
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.332
Yes, Your Honour.

195
00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:03.055
And son, do you understand this?

196
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:06.377
Yes, Your Honour.

197
00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:13.286
Good. You're free
to go Mr Logan.

198
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.899
Thank you.
- Bow, bow.

199
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:20.380
Missed 10
days over one term.

200
00:24:21.266 --> 00:24:23.266
Does that sound right?

201
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.710
Yeah.

202
00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:31.226
Billy…

203
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.839
could you wait
outside for a moment?

204
00:24:33.887 --> 00:24:35.277
Thank you.

205
00:24:52.205 --> 00:24:54.714
Mr Logan, paying
the amount of money

206
00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:56.059
that one does for
school like this

207
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.100
doesn't guarantee anything.

208
00:24:59.085 --> 00:25:00.219
What do you mean?

209
00:25:00.244 --> 00:25:02.385
What I'm saying is…

210
00:25:02.627 --> 00:25:06.435
Billy could be just as well
suited to a good public school.

211
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.708
You don't want him.

212
00:25:09.733 --> 00:25:11.792
It's not about what I want.

213
00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:14.937
He doesn't seem to want
to be here. Does he?

214
00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:21.739
Mr Logan…

215
00:25:22.313 --> 00:25:25.092
you haven't paid
last term's fees.

216
00:25:25.117 --> 00:25:28.760
All I'm saying is there
are good alternatives.

217
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.519
He might be happier
at a public school.

218
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.719
It might be better for
him and easier for you.

219
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.979
I'll make sure that I
pay what's outstanding.

220
00:25:39.885 --> 00:25:41.885
And he won't miss
anymore school.

221
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.038
Hey, here he is!

222
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.119
You look thin.

223
00:26:20.504 --> 00:26:22.075
- Do I?
- Yeah.

224
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.319
What have you done
to your fucking hair?

225
00:26:24.639 --> 00:26:26.639
What you don't like this?

226
00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:29.500
Well, it's good on you.

227
00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:31.779
But I did try that, mate,
I looked like a fuckwit.

228
00:26:36.739 --> 00:26:39.359
So you came home, eh, mate?

229
00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:42.158
Yeah. Better job.

230
00:26:42.191 --> 00:26:44.851
See her and, you
know, kid's in school.

231
00:26:45.018 --> 00:26:47.018
They're buried here.

232
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:50.151
Well, it's really
good to see you, son.

233
00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:56.852
Billy good?

234
00:26:56.877 --> 00:26:58.713
How's Layla?

235
00:27:02.052 --> 00:27:04.052
Na, she sort of cut me off.

236
00:27:05.845 --> 00:27:08.445
She ended up fucking some
bloke she worked with.

237
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:12.032
Big fat cunt.

238
00:27:12.057 --> 00:27:13.960
I followed him, he's
one of those guys

239
00:27:14.057 --> 00:27:16.718
that gets all dressed up
in lycra to ride his bike

240
00:27:16.818 --> 00:27:18.607
on a weekend.

241
00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:22.365
I nearly run the fucker over.

242
00:27:22.538 --> 00:27:24.578
- But you didn't?
- No I didn't, Corporal.

243
00:27:27.318 --> 00:27:30.358
Your daughters… you
had two of them?

244
00:27:30.383 --> 00:27:32.383
How are they doing?

245
00:27:35.317 --> 00:27:37.357
Ah, they don't talk to me.

246
00:27:38.644 --> 00:27:40.024
Sorry to hear that.

247
00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:42.459
No, what can you do?

248
00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:46.919
You know, I thought
about going back bush

249
00:27:46.944 --> 00:27:49.124
there for a little while,
you know, going home.

250
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:51.149
Good idea. Why didn't ya?

251
00:27:52.218 --> 00:27:54.557
Me mum and dad died and then…

252
00:27:54.858 --> 00:27:56.858
there's no work.

253
00:27:57.145 --> 00:27:59.684
Me brother and me sister,
you know, them they…

254
00:27:59.818 --> 00:28:02.058
they fucked off, there's
just no one there I knew.

255
00:28:03.885 --> 00:28:07.157
What about your boy?
How old's he now?

256
00:28:09.458 --> 00:28:11.330
He's a teenager.

257
00:28:12.849 --> 00:28:15.190
Fuck. What's he like?

258
00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:17.198
Like a teenager.

259
00:28:19.342 --> 00:28:21.322
Does he listen to you?

260
00:28:22.622 --> 00:28:25.623
Nup, it's hard being a soldier,
when you're not a soldier.

261
00:28:26.699 --> 00:28:28.699
No cunt will listen to you.

262
00:28:29.858 --> 00:28:32.158
What are you doing for
work? What do you do?

263
00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:33.719
I'm a sales rep.

264
00:28:37.212 --> 00:28:38.912
Yeah…

265
00:28:38.937 --> 00:28:40.936
what about you? You…

266
00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:44.137
still doing the same thing?

267
00:28:46.123 --> 00:28:48.123
It's what we're
good at, Corporal.

268
00:28:49.957 --> 00:28:53.058
And I haven't got enough room in
my brain to learn other things.

269
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.762
One of the reasons I
want to see you, son.

270
00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:00.153
Wanted to know if
you'd be interested

271
00:29:00.177 --> 00:29:02.177
in doing something with me.

272
00:29:04.617 --> 00:29:06.757
I need your help, son.

273
00:29:06.782 --> 00:29:08.491
Alright.

274
00:29:09.787 --> 00:29:11.699
So we can stop talking
this kind of shit now

275
00:29:11.724 --> 00:29:14.203
and talk about stuff
that really matters?

276
00:29:14.228 --> 00:29:18.797
Look, I need help.
One night, right?

277
00:29:18.822 --> 00:29:21.207
In and out. Zero rounds.

278
00:29:21.958 --> 00:29:23.595
That's it.

279
00:29:24.857 --> 00:29:26.857
Just fucking think about it.

280
00:30:14.058 --> 00:30:17.378
Stay with me, mate.
Mate, you gotta stay awake.

281
00:30:18.737 --> 00:30:21.131
Hey buddy. You're doing well.

282
00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:28.616
Yeah, his pressure's 80 over 30. His pulse's thready.
- We need to move quickly.

283
00:30:36.177 --> 00:30:39.156
You can start
the transfusion.

284
00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:41.397
What's the status of the baby?

285
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.530
You got shit in the
corner of your mouth.

286
00:31:05.016 --> 00:31:07.016
What's that?

287
00:31:10.337 --> 00:31:12.337
Nothing.

288
00:31:19.923 --> 00:31:21.923
2009…

289
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.329
It is for drinkers who
enjoy rich, mouth-fill…

290
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.471
It's for drinkers who enjoy
a rich mouth-filling wine

291
00:31:29.496 --> 00:31:31.879
with plenty of
fruit and flavour.

292
00:31:49.256 --> 00:31:51.676
Hey mate. Hi, I'm Ryan
Logan, I work for Playfords.

293
00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:52.996
I'm the new rep.

294
00:31:53.097 --> 00:31:54.633
Just thought I'd come
by introduce myself

295
00:31:54.657 --> 00:31:55.982
and get you to check
out some of the specials

296
00:31:56.006 --> 00:31:57.104
we've got this month.

297
00:31:57.129 --> 00:31:59.017
What happened to
the other bloke?

298
00:31:59.974 --> 00:32:01.974
Um… I dunno. Um…

299
00:32:03.136 --> 00:32:05.355
So we've got a
sauvignon blanc, right,

300
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.191
earthy tones, real
leathery on the palate.

301
00:32:09.216 --> 00:32:11.005
Mate, you want to tell
me about the specials,

302
00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.476
you call in make an
appointment, it's how we do it.

303
00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:14.451
OK.

304
00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:17.154
What's a good day that I
can make an appointment?

305
00:32:20.177 --> 00:32:21.996
You make a phone call,
make an appointment.

306
00:32:22.096 --> 00:32:24.096
And then we get there.

307
00:32:28.457 --> 00:32:30.555
Is there someone else
I could talk to maybe?

308
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.951
Because, you know, we've
got some great tempranillos,

309
00:32:34.976 --> 00:32:37.008
have you ever heard of
them... Just fuck off.

310
00:32:45.456 --> 00:32:46.875
Um…

311
00:32:46.976 --> 00:32:49.456
I'll just leave you with
this. Thank you for your time.

312
00:33:19.976 --> 00:33:22.115
Now, you ever talk
to me that way again

313
00:33:22.216 --> 00:33:23.676
I'll cut you so deep and so much

314
00:33:23.776 --> 00:33:25.152
you'll need a fucking
team of dress makers

315
00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:27.555
to put you back together,
do you understand?

316
00:33:27.655 --> 00:33:29.228
Yeah.

317
00:33:41.762 --> 00:33:45.742
This one time, we
had this Afghan,

318
00:33:45.767 --> 00:33:47.250
we were interrogating him.

319
00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:49.655
He was…Taliban.

320
00:33:49.855 --> 00:33:51.434
You know what that is?

321
00:33:51.459 --> 00:33:52.589
Yeah.

322
00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:54.674
Anyway, we had to…

323
00:33:54.967 --> 00:33:56.507
transport him to
another province,

324
00:33:56.532 --> 00:33:58.829
so the Afghan
interpreter, he fucks off.

325
00:33:59.695 --> 00:34:01.195
And I take the
cuffs off this fella

326
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.359
so I can take him
to the helicopter.

327
00:34:03.384 --> 00:34:05.384
And gets his arms free…

328
00:34:05.822 --> 00:34:08.140
and first thing he does
he goes for my rifle.

329
00:34:11.454 --> 00:34:13.454
Fuck was I supposed to do?

330
00:34:17.095 --> 00:34:19.095
Did he die?

331
00:34:23.534 --> 00:34:25.534
Did my dad ever kill anyone?

332
00:34:29.603 --> 00:34:31.603
Your dad was a sniper, son.

333
00:34:34.136 --> 00:34:35.662
Hey…

334
00:34:37.722 --> 00:34:39.722
Your dad's a fucking hero.

335
00:34:41.055 --> 00:34:43.074
You understand?

336
00:34:43.174 --> 00:34:45.174
Yeah.

337
00:34:51.614 --> 00:34:54.928
Do you ever think about
the guy you killed?

338
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:01.125
Oh…

339
00:35:02.254 --> 00:35:04.334
it's strange, you know, you…

340
00:35:08.461 --> 00:35:10.520
you kill someone and…

341
00:35:10.694 --> 00:35:13.000
after you wonder just how
the fuck your paths crossed,

342
00:35:13.025 --> 00:35:15.025
you know?

343
00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:19.842
How people get into situations
where someone's gonna die.

344
00:35:22.293 --> 00:35:23.813
It's always someone
you've never known,

345
00:35:23.838 --> 00:35:25.998
someone you don't know
a fucking thing about.

346
00:35:29.453 --> 00:35:31.350
And that poor cunt had never
seen me before that day,

347
00:35:31.374 --> 00:35:33.374
and I'm the one that
turned out his light.

348
00:35:35.815 --> 00:35:37.815
Just like that.

349
00:35:40.295 --> 00:35:42.655
Johnny. Corporal.

350
00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.854
Hey.

351
00:35:46.255 --> 00:35:49.434
Talking to your young fella,
mate. He's all grown up.

352
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.986
Yeah.

353
00:35:52.579 --> 00:35:53.828
Here.

354
00:35:55.854 --> 00:35:57.954
How'd you know where I lived?

355
00:35:57.979 --> 00:35:59.979
I had you under surveillance.

356
00:36:02.462 --> 00:36:04.321
You didn't give
him a beer did you?

357
00:36:04.346 --> 00:36:06.645
- No.
- Good.

358
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.670
What do you want, Johnny?

359
00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:14.475
You know what I want, mate.

360
00:36:19.015 --> 00:36:20.620
Just want to have a chat.

361
00:36:26.854 --> 00:36:28.389
He's a growing boy,
he's gotta eat.

362
00:36:28.414 --> 00:36:30.113
How about I meet
you down the pub?

363
00:36:30.138 --> 00:36:31.881
Yeah, yeah.

364
00:36:32.392 --> 00:36:33.902
Hey…

365
00:36:37.613 --> 00:36:39.553
really good to see
you again, son.

366
00:36:39.653 --> 00:36:41.325
Yeah.

367
00:36:44.188 --> 00:36:45.861
Should be proud, mate.

368
00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:52.773
See you down there, brother.

369
00:37:00.054 --> 00:37:02.134
What was he talking
to you about?

370
00:37:03.134 --> 00:37:05.134
Nothin'.

371
00:37:06.213 --> 00:37:08.074
He's just…

372
00:37:08.174 --> 00:37:09.793
just telling me stories.

373
00:37:27.253 --> 00:37:28.957
Yo. You alright?

374
00:37:29.266 --> 00:37:31.266
Yeah, I'm good, son.

375
00:37:36.653 --> 00:37:39.677
John, I'm gonna pass. I'm
not interested in this.

376
00:37:39.702 --> 00:37:41.869
Whatever it is, you
know, it's not for me.

377
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.940
Yeah OK. No Drama.

378
00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:48.669
OK.

379
00:37:50.173 --> 00:37:51.314
Hey…

380
00:37:54.032 --> 00:37:56.196
to be honest, I didn't expect
to hear that, Corporal.

381
00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:01.342
You forgotten
about Tony McManus?

382
00:38:04.653 --> 00:38:05.916
No.

383
00:38:05.941 --> 00:38:07.633
No.

384
00:38:08.772 --> 00:38:12.052
And I did that
'cause I love you.

385
00:38:14.179 --> 00:38:16.079
Because you're my brother

386
00:38:16.104 --> 00:38:18.232
and you'd done the
same thing for me.

387
00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:22.021
Wouldn't ya?

388
00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:24.133
Son?

389
00:38:44.198 --> 00:38:46.859
That felt good at the
bottle shop today, didn't it?

390
00:38:57.972 --> 00:39:00.771
Who the fuck did he
think he was talking to?

391
00:39:02.974 --> 00:39:04.512
He doesn't know you.

392
00:39:08.271 --> 00:39:10.271
None of them do.

393
00:39:20.012 --> 00:39:22.752
Every party he went
to. Rooting at 14.

394
00:39:22.852 --> 00:39:24.593
- Your dad? What? No way.
- Yes.

395
00:39:24.693 --> 00:39:27.312
- That's a lie. It's bullshit.
- You're full of shit.

396
00:39:27.412 --> 00:39:29.452
No mate. Swear. Swear to god.

397
00:39:33.312 --> 00:39:35.312
What the fuck do
you want, Logan?

398
00:39:38.684 --> 00:39:40.684
My dad was in the SAS.

399
00:39:41.439 --> 00:39:43.811
Sure. Bit of a badass is he?

400
00:39:45.652 --> 00:39:47.652
He go to war and shit?

401
00:39:49.132 --> 00:39:50.551
Yeah.

402
00:39:51.025 --> 00:39:52.685
He kill people?

403
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.528
He was a sniper.

404
00:39:55.531 --> 00:39:56.951
He's like a hero.

405
00:39:56.976 --> 00:39:58.996
Says who?

406
00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:00.393
The other soldiers.

407
00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:02.819
Do you reckon you're some
type of hero as well?

408
00:40:03.413 --> 00:40:04.638
No.

409
00:40:05.618 --> 00:40:07.038
Lay off it, Jesse.

410
00:40:08.691 --> 00:40:10.450
Do you wanna sit down?

411
00:40:12.292 --> 00:40:13.734
Sit down.

412
00:40:15.652 --> 00:40:18.111
Fuck alright. You
going to the party Friday?

413
00:40:18.212 --> 00:40:19.492
- Yeah.
- Are you?

414
00:40:19.531 --> 00:40:21.271
Yeah, let's go.

415
00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:23.772
Anyone else coming you know?

416
00:40:24.611 --> 00:40:26.507
Hmm few of those chicks
from friend group over the side

417
00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:28.271
of the back of the
hall there are going.

418
00:40:28.371 --> 00:40:30.272
Oh yeah,
yeah. They're alright.

419
00:40:30.297 --> 00:40:32.297
You asked him.

420
00:40:40.213 --> 00:40:42.871
And what do you do when
you don't have this?

421
00:40:42.972 --> 00:40:45.092
Not much, just ride dirtbikes.

422
00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:51.157
Same as always, Corporal.

423
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:53.952
Yes sir.

424
00:41:41.812 --> 00:41:43.871
Ah fuck!

425
00:41:43.896 --> 00:41:45.436
Stay there.

426
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:58.991
Sh sh. Hey hey.

427
00:41:59.092 --> 00:42:01.351
You listen to me, you will
give me the fucking code.

428
00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:02.871
You see these?

429
00:42:02.972 --> 00:42:05.431
I don't get the code the next
one I'm not gonna fucking break,

430
00:42:05.532 --> 00:42:07.271
mate, I'll cut that fucker off.

431
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:10.372
- OK. OK. OK. OK.
- Quietly cunt.

432
00:42:10.397 --> 00:42:12.256
What's the code?

433
00:42:12.281 --> 00:42:14.471
3-5-6-4-5-6.

434
00:43:08.895 --> 00:43:10.797
Shh.

435
00:43:30.877 --> 00:43:32.730
Sorry, Johnny.

436
00:43:34.404 --> 00:43:36.142
Fuck, Ray.

437
00:44:27.991 --> 00:44:30.391
Fuck. Bring him in.

438
00:44:31.199 --> 00:44:33.109
Corporal, bring him in.

439
00:44:33.134 --> 00:44:35.134
Corporal we don't have
fucking time, bring him in.

440
00:44:36.095 --> 00:44:39.903
We have to go right fucking
now, so bring him inside.

441
00:45:16.076 --> 00:45:18.076
Tell me that didn't feel good?

442
00:45:19.495 --> 00:45:21.744
You must miss that, son?

443
00:45:22.536 --> 00:45:24.536
Being a soldier.

444
00:45:28.355 --> 00:45:30.355
Fucking IED.

445
00:45:32.036 --> 00:45:34.036
That's it, you're out.

446
00:45:35.315 --> 00:45:37.315
Now you said no rounds?

447
00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:41.187
Fuck him. It was in his knee.

448
00:45:43.982 --> 00:45:45.983
I heard two pops.

449
00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.450
You're hearing things, Corporal.

450
00:45:53.082 --> 00:45:56.923
Yeah, I don't really want to
know what it's all about, so…

451
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.090
Yeah, right.

452
00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:04.249
When have you ever really known?

453
00:46:11.121 --> 00:46:13.121
Missed you at Jacko's funeral.

454
00:46:15.488 --> 00:46:17.488
I missed ya.

455
00:46:24.769 --> 00:46:26.769
You ever thought
about doing that?

456
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:42.400
Billy.

457
00:46:45.294 --> 00:46:46.861
Yeah.

458
00:46:49.248 --> 00:46:51.248
Yeah.

459
00:46:53.529 --> 00:46:55.529
Thank you for tonight, son.

460
00:46:57.208 --> 00:46:58.509
Thank you.

461
00:47:58.327 --> 00:48:01.448
He said you threatened
to cut him. Is that right?

462
00:48:04.169 --> 00:48:07.148
Mate, you cannot be talking
to customers like that.

463
00:48:07.248 --> 00:48:08.585
Can't be talking to
anyone like that.

464
00:48:08.609 --> 00:48:09.948
Do you understand that?

465
00:48:10.049 --> 00:48:11.308
Yes.

466
00:48:11.408 --> 00:48:13.888
Can I ask exactly what prompted
you to say something like that?

467
00:48:15.448 --> 00:48:17.649
It was just the way
that he spoke to me.

468
00:48:18.489 --> 00:48:20.487
Like what?

469
00:48:23.247 --> 00:48:25.247
Like, I was…

470
00:48:26.448 --> 00:48:28.448
just a…

471
00:48:29.127 --> 00:48:31.127
Yeah, I get it.

472
00:48:33.687 --> 00:48:36.427
Yeah mate, I've gotta be honest,
I just didn't see this coming.

473
00:48:36.527 --> 00:48:37.707
I mean, you haven't…

474
00:48:37.808 --> 00:48:40.067
you haven't set the world
on fire with your numbers,

475
00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:43.268
but your effort, mate, your
effort's been brilliant.

476
00:48:43.368 --> 00:48:45.147
Now, look, the shop owner…

477
00:48:45.247 --> 00:48:48.188
the shop owner will
accept an apology, right?

478
00:48:48.289 --> 00:48:50.349
Can you do that? We apologise.

479
00:48:50.449 --> 00:48:52.688
We put it down to having
a bad day and we move on.

480
00:48:54.048 --> 00:48:56.048
Can you do that?

481
00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:58.507
Yeah.

482
00:48:58.608 --> 00:49:00.307
Yeah, I can apologise.

483
00:49:00.407 --> 00:49:02.867
But what I can't do is promise
you that I won't do it again

484
00:49:02.967 --> 00:49:04.427
if someone speaks
to me that way.

485
00:49:04.527 --> 00:49:06.108
You can't speak to
people like that

486
00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:08.208
with so fucking little respect.

487
00:49:17.248 --> 00:49:19.907
I'm sorry, Ryan, I can't.
Can't risk it, mate.

488
00:49:20.007 --> 00:49:22.387
Not after I've just warned
you, I'll end up without a job.

489
00:49:22.487 --> 00:49:24.487
Sorry.

490
00:49:27.447 --> 00:49:29.266
It's cool, man.

491
00:49:31.566 --> 00:49:33.567
It's cool.

492
00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:38.607
Thank you for the opportunity.

493
00:49:49.968 --> 00:49:52.767
- What a bitch, bro.
- Shut up, Brad.

494
00:49:55.328 --> 00:49:56.868
It's good, eh?

495
00:50:10.446 --> 00:50:12.446
Want some?

496
00:50:16.207 --> 00:50:18.347
I can't.

497
00:50:18.447 --> 00:50:21.367
- Why can't you?
- 'Cause he's a fucking pussy.

498
00:50:22.768 --> 00:50:24.708
Just do it.

499
00:50:24.808 --> 00:50:26.808
Doesn't have to do it if
he doesn't want to, boys.

500
00:50:27.447 --> 00:50:28.588
Shit, I'm sorry. Chill out.

501
00:50:28.688 --> 00:50:30.688
Fuck, sorry, Brad.

502
00:50:44.047 --> 00:50:45.626
Thank you.

503
00:50:45.726 --> 00:50:47.146
For before.

504
00:50:47.246 --> 00:50:48.306
Yeah, all good.

505
00:50:48.407 --> 00:50:50.407
It's fine. They can be
dickheads sometimes.

506
00:50:54.007 --> 00:50:56.007
You know, I've had it before.

507
00:50:57.407 --> 00:50:59.226
Hm.

508
00:50:59.326 --> 00:51:01.326
Been to court for it.

509
00:51:03.448 --> 00:51:05.147
For real?

510
00:51:05.247 --> 00:51:08.006
Yeah. Some other shit.

511
00:51:08.807 --> 00:51:10.807
One more time and
I get taken away.

512
00:51:11.366 --> 00:51:13.366
Taken away where?

513
00:51:14.606 --> 00:51:16.606
Juvie, I guess.

514
00:51:16.966 --> 00:51:20.707
Doesn't that scare ya?
Isn't juvie like…jail?

515
00:51:20.807 --> 00:51:22.807
I don't know.

516
00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.227
Isn't your dad SAS?

517
00:51:25.327 --> 00:51:27.327
Wouldn't he be really strict?

518
00:51:29.727 --> 00:51:31.727
He's pretty useless now.

519
00:51:32.807 --> 00:51:34.807
Not like he used to be.
- Fuck.

520
00:51:37.966 --> 00:51:39.966
What happened there?

521
00:51:40.285 --> 00:51:42.285
Car accident.

522
00:51:43.365 --> 00:51:45.365
That's gnarly.

523
00:51:47.447 --> 00:51:50.626
- Sorry.
- Oh…you can touch it…

524
00:51:50.726 --> 00:51:52.726
if you want.

525
00:51:56.286 --> 00:51:58.286
Fucking weird eh?

526
00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:04.947
Having a party at my old
man's house on Friday night.

527
00:52:05.047 --> 00:52:07.027
He's away for the weekend.

528
00:52:07.127 --> 00:52:09.125
You want to come?

529
00:52:09.525 --> 00:52:11.065
Really?

530
00:52:11.165 --> 00:52:13.425
Yeah, it'll be fun.

531
00:52:13.525 --> 00:52:15.025
Bunch of drinks.

532
00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:17.125
Different people. Girls.

533
00:52:17.525 --> 00:52:19.525
It'll be mad.

534
00:52:41.646 --> 00:52:43.646
What are you gonna do?

535
00:52:46.805 --> 00:52:48.805
You're failing him.

536
00:53:15.365 --> 00:53:18.185
- So how many is that?
- 8 or 9, I think.

537
00:53:18.286 --> 00:53:20.346
Well mate, you're a
better man than me.

538
00:53:20.446 --> 00:53:23.505
'Cause the last proper job I had
was selling fucking power tools.

539
00:53:23.605 --> 00:53:25.266
It was fucking great.

540
00:53:25.366 --> 00:53:28.306
Boss was a fuckwit wouldn't
look me in the eye.

541
00:53:28.406 --> 00:53:30.266
Told me I had to
wear an eye patch.

542
00:53:30.366 --> 00:53:33.065
Like a fucking pirate.
Yeah, like a fucking pirate.

543
00:53:33.165 --> 00:53:34.822
So I knocked that cunt
out at Christmas party

544
00:53:34.846 --> 00:53:36.385
and was fucking dismissed.

545
00:53:39.766 --> 00:53:42.505
You know, if you've got anything
that I can help you with, sir,

546
00:53:42.605 --> 00:53:43.905
it'd be great.

547
00:53:44.005 --> 00:53:45.742
I got some money, that's
Billy's for his school,

548
00:53:45.766 --> 00:53:47.420
I can't touch it, but I
just need a little bit

549
00:53:47.444 --> 00:53:49.105
for the normal civilian shit.

550
00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:50.701
And I don't think my
pension's gonna cut it

551
00:53:50.725 --> 00:53:52.045
and I'm certainly
not gonna win it

552
00:53:52.085 --> 00:53:54.085
off a 10 to 1 beef rocket, am I?

553
00:53:55.364 --> 00:53:57.364
Son, you don't have to
explain anything to me.

554
00:53:58.964 --> 00:54:02.004
Yeah, but I… it's a bit
embarrassing asking.

555
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.365
I got something for you.

556
00:54:07.166 --> 00:54:09.206
I've got something you
can keep an eye on for me.

557
00:54:10.965 --> 00:54:13.905
- Twitchy fucker I don 't trust.
- You don't trust many people.

558
00:54:14.005 --> 00:54:16.005
I trust you, son.

559
00:54:18.405 --> 00:54:20.504
So yeah, if you
want it, it's yours.

560
00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.805
You going hunting?

561
00:54:48.124 --> 00:54:50.125
Do you want to go hunting?

562
00:54:50.446 --> 00:54:52.446
You know, with me, like before.

563
00:55:02.524 --> 00:55:04.524
Do you remember how
to sight a rifle?

564
00:55:05.725 --> 00:55:07.725
Kind of.

565
00:55:09.324 --> 00:55:11.324
Go on then.

566
00:55:33.044 --> 00:55:35.045
- Dad?
- Mm-hm?

567
00:55:36.244 --> 00:55:38.244
Can I go out tonight?

568
00:55:39.604 --> 00:55:41.704
Where?

569
00:55:41.804 --> 00:55:43.804
A house.

570
00:55:46.604 --> 00:55:48.604
Who with?

571
00:55:50.164 --> 00:55:52.164
Friends from school.

572
00:55:54.045 --> 00:55:56.264
You gonna come back?

573
00:55:56.365 --> 00:55:58.363
Yeah, I promise.

574
00:56:04.963 --> 00:56:06.963
OK.

575
00:56:09.043 --> 00:56:11.043
Thanks.

576
00:56:11.963 --> 00:56:13.963
But thank you for asking me.

577
00:56:46.444 --> 00:56:49.303
Oi Jesse,
skull it you dog!

578
00:56:49.404 --> 00:56:50.583
Go on.

579
00:56:50.683 --> 00:56:52.183
Go Jesse.

580
00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:56.303
Logan and Brad.

581
00:56:56.404 --> 00:56:57.904
3-2-1.

582
00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:02.183
Logan's got a squirter!

583
00:57:04.443 --> 00:57:06.224
- You cheated, bro.
- Fuck off.

584
00:57:06.324 --> 00:57:08.264
That's what I do cunt. Fuck off.

585
00:57:08.364 --> 00:57:10.364
Good on you brother.

586
00:57:29.804 --> 00:57:33.163
I'm just saying, whoever done
this were trained like you.

587
00:57:34.163 --> 00:57:36.303
I mean, boys said it was
like two fucking ninjas

588
00:57:36.403 --> 00:57:38.402
come through the joint.

589
00:57:41.842 --> 00:57:43.842
And you know, Ray.

590
00:57:46.043 --> 00:57:48.322
No. You know fucking Ray.

591
00:57:49.443 --> 00:57:50.504
Alright, if you say so.

592
00:57:50.604 --> 00:57:52.723
Right, well he copped it. Dead.

593
00:57:54.524 --> 00:57:57.004
That's no fucking
good is it… Ned?

594
00:57:59.044 --> 00:58:01.524
Boys said the door were locked
too, so someone's picked that.

595
00:58:04.283 --> 00:58:06.263
Look, I'm just wondering…

596
00:58:06.363 --> 00:58:08.383
if you know anyone else
out there in the game,

597
00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:10.622
that's got the same
skill set as you?

598
00:58:14.042 --> 00:58:16.142
I mean, it could have been you.

599
00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:18.862
You've been there before,
you know what's in there.

600
00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:20.702
Maybe you swiped the keys.

601
00:58:20.803 --> 00:58:21.942
We're not saying that, John.

602
00:58:22.042 --> 00:58:23.538
Man, that's exactly
what I'm fucking saying.

603
00:58:23.562 --> 00:58:26.942
Listen… I didn't
fucking take anything.

604
00:58:27.042 --> 00:58:29.182
I didn't go into your
fucking apartment,

605
00:58:29.283 --> 00:58:33.142
I didn't open any fucking safe,
I didn't pick any fucking lock.

606
00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:35.244
I work for you.

607
00:58:36.123 --> 00:58:37.224
Last I checked.

608
00:58:37.324 --> 00:58:39.044
Come on, Ned, are you
gonna trust this cunt?

609
00:58:39.123 --> 00:58:40.983
Fucking look at him!
Mate, I am telling you.

610
00:58:41.083 --> 00:58:43.342
Mate, I'm having a chat, right?

611
00:58:43.442 --> 00:58:45.702
I never liked Johnny. I never
fucking liked ya Johnny.

612
00:58:45.802 --> 00:58:47.262
- Fuck...
- We're having a beer.

613
00:58:47.362 --> 00:58:49.342
We're having a chat,
alright? Just relax.

614
00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:52.003
Fucking relaxed.
This is me relaxed.

615
00:58:54.203 --> 00:58:56.203
What are you doing?

616
00:58:58.163 --> 00:59:00.163
This is how
you're taking care of it?

617
00:59:13.962 --> 00:59:15.421
Oh!

618
00:59:21.002 --> 00:59:22.182
I'm driving.

619
00:59:22.283 --> 00:59:23.863
Bullshit, Jesse,
you had your turn.

620
00:59:23.963 --> 00:59:25.218
Why the fuck do
you get to decide?

621
00:59:25.242 --> 00:59:26.343
It's my dad's car.

622
00:59:26.443 --> 00:59:28.443
Are you up for it, Logan?

623
00:59:31.642 --> 00:59:33.062
Don't be a soft cock now, Logan.

624
00:59:33.162 --> 00:59:35.339
- Get the fuck in the car.
- What are you scared of mate?

625
00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:36.698
- Come on.
- Everyone's had their go.

626
00:59:36.722 --> 00:59:38.383
Get in the car.

627
00:59:38.483 --> 00:59:40.058
- Yeah, come on mate.
- Don't be a pussy.

628
00:59:40.082 --> 00:59:42.082
Get in there, mate!

629
01:00:04.961 --> 01:00:06.962
Please don't say anything.

630
01:00:18.042 --> 01:00:20.042
Oh Billy.

631
01:00:21.002 --> 01:00:23.442
Slow down. Where are you?

632
01:00:54.802 --> 01:00:56.182
You OK?

633
01:00:56.282 --> 01:00:58.282
Yeah.

634
01:01:14.802 --> 01:01:16.802
What are you gonna do?

635
01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:20.242
Are you gonna go to the cops?

636
01:01:24.242 --> 01:01:26.421
Dad's fucking gonna kill me.

637
01:01:26.521 --> 01:01:28.500
Look at it, it's fucked.

638
01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.600
I'm sorry.

639
01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.240
We're in so much shit.

640
01:01:35.962 --> 01:01:38.382
It's fine, we were
just passengers.

641
01:01:38.482 --> 01:01:40.181
Billy was driving.

642
01:01:52.121 --> 01:01:54.121
Sit down.

643
01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:04.020
- Did anyone see you?
- No.

644
01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.701
No one came by?
- No.

645
01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:09.580
- No? Whose car is it?
- It's my dad's car.

646
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:11.681
Anyone know you got it?

647
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.600
Who was drinking?

648
01:02:27.521 --> 01:02:29.521
Were you drinking?

649
01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.981
I was drinking, Dad.

650
01:03:01.521 --> 01:03:03.521
Get in the car.

651
01:03:53.201 --> 01:03:55.201
Billy! Unlock the door!

652
01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.320
Billy!

653
01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:01.340
Open the door!

654
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.101
- No!
- Open the door now!

655
01:04:04.201 --> 01:04:06.201
Fuck off!

656
01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.499
Hey.

657
01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:22.400
Hey. Look at me. Look at me.

658
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.979
OK.

659
01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:28.079
OK.

660
01:05:41.239 --> 01:05:43.299
Yeah, mate,
yeah. About seven.

661
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.400
Righto.

662
01:05:47.239 --> 01:05:49.759
- Can I help you?
- I'm Ryan Logan, Billy's dad.

663
01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:54.578
Right.

664
01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:56.258
You better come in then.

665
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.800
You were in the army
my son tells me?

666
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.939
- Yeah.
- You serve in Iraq?

667
01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:18.059
Yeah.

668
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.280
Well, we shouldn't have
fucking been there, should we?

669
01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:27.439
So, where's my car?

670
01:06:28.598 --> 01:06:30.598
I burned it.

671
01:06:31.959 --> 01:06:33.218
I beg your pardon?

672
01:06:33.318 --> 01:06:34.939
I burned it, it was a write-off.

673
01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:37.039
Figured you'd have insurance.

674
01:06:38.359 --> 01:06:41.359
So you want me to say it
was stolen and then torched?

675
01:06:47.519 --> 01:06:49.598
Do you know what I do
for a living, soldier?

676
01:06:51.278 --> 01:06:53.258
I'm a solicitor.

677
01:06:53.358 --> 01:06:57.159
Principal at a law firm.
Very fucking prestigious one.

678
01:06:58.518 --> 01:07:00.058
Do you have any idea
what would happen

679
01:07:00.159 --> 01:07:01.858
if I made a false
insurance claim

680
01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:04.038
like the one you've
set me up to make?

681
01:07:05.038 --> 01:07:07.258
And upon the mandatory
investigation of the claim,

682
01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:09.358
it was found to be fraudulent…

683
01:07:10.358 --> 01:07:12.358
I could go to jail.

684
01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:15.598
At the very least I wouldn't
be practicing law ever again.

685
01:07:25.038 --> 01:07:27.478
My son said your boy's
a fucking ratbag.

686
01:07:29.598 --> 01:07:30.978
OK.

687
01:07:31.078 --> 01:07:33.078
He's already been in
trouble with the cops.

688
01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.418
Yeah.

689
01:07:37.518 --> 01:07:39.519
Your boy…

690
01:07:40.039 --> 01:07:42.039
he was pissed.

691
01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:44.499
They were all drinking.

692
01:07:44.599 --> 01:07:45.999
Yeah, they might
have been drinking,

693
01:07:46.039 --> 01:07:47.975
but they didn't get behind
the fucking wheel of a car,

694
01:07:47.999 --> 01:07:49.378
did they?

695
01:07:49.479 --> 01:07:51.479
My car.

696
01:07:52.599 --> 01:07:54.599
Yeah.

697
01:07:57.957 --> 01:07:59.957
You need this to go away?

698
01:08:02.797 --> 01:08:04.797
Please.

699
01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.558
Sorry, I can't help you.

700
01:08:18.358 --> 01:08:20.717
To claim on my insurance,
I need to be honest.

701
01:08:22.717 --> 01:08:24.698
But here's some free counsel.

702
01:08:24.798 --> 01:08:26.019
As far as the fire goes,

703
01:08:26.119 --> 01:08:28.379
I'd let that fall on
your son's shoulders.

704
01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.218
Sounds like he's in
enough trouble already.

705
01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.437
And there's no upside in
you admitting to that.

706
01:08:36.718 --> 01:08:38.658
OK, so the police are
gonna be involved?

707
01:08:38.758 --> 01:08:40.758
Of course.

708
01:08:41.358 --> 01:08:43.358
What if I pay for the car?

709
01:08:48.238 --> 01:08:50.238
Do you know what a car
like that is worth?

710
01:08:55.358 --> 01:08:57.718
I'll get you the money and
then you just leave it alone.

711
01:09:01.517 --> 01:09:03.517
Yeah?

712
01:09:04.356 --> 01:09:06.757
You get me the money,
we'll see what we'll see.

713
01:09:08.158 --> 01:09:10.958
In the meantime, tell your
boy to find some new friends.

714
01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:15.038
I don't need my son hanging
around with trouble.

715
01:09:26.357 --> 01:09:28.357
Just give me a couple of days.

716
01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.698
Thank you for your time.

717
01:10:16.477 --> 01:10:19.857
Hey. Hey, come here, son.

718
01:10:19.957 --> 01:10:22.257
Alright, just take a breath.

719
01:10:22.357 --> 01:10:24.937
Look at me. Just take a
breath, you'll be alright.

720
01:10:25.037 --> 01:10:26.336
- OK?
- Yep.

721
01:10:26.437 --> 01:10:28.437
I got you. You understand?

722
01:10:33.836 --> 01:10:35.296
Mr Logan.

723
01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:36.857
Yeah?

724
01:10:36.957 --> 01:10:38.978
Mr Logan, your wife and your son

725
01:10:39.078 --> 01:10:41.417
are both in the RH
null blood group.

726
01:10:41.518 --> 01:10:43.517
There's no RH antigens.

727
01:10:43.997 --> 01:10:45.417
Yeah, that's right.

728
01:10:45.517 --> 01:10:47.413
So you're aware of what
the problems with that are?

729
01:10:47.437 --> 01:10:49.257
Yeah, they give
blood all the time.

730
01:10:49.357 --> 01:10:51.136
They have to. It's here.

731
01:10:51.237 --> 01:10:52.357
So there's not enough blood.

732
01:10:52.437 --> 01:10:55.056
There's some on the way, but
we don't have enough time.

733
01:10:55.157 --> 01:10:56.413
They're both bleeding internally

734
01:10:56.437 --> 01:10:58.857
and your son has
ruptured his spleen.

735
01:10:58.957 --> 01:11:00.297
Your wife…

736
01:11:00.397 --> 01:11:02.257
she's lost the baby.

737
01:11:02.357 --> 01:11:03.417
OK.

738
01:11:03.517 --> 01:11:05.657
And she has severe
head injuries.

739
01:11:05.757 --> 01:11:09.037
She's bleeding from her
liver from her entire gut.

740
01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.517
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

741
01:11:16.156 --> 01:11:19.076
Yeah, well, give them the
blood. How is the baby?

742
01:11:20.796 --> 01:11:22.016
The baby's died. OK?

743
01:11:22.116 --> 01:11:24.336
So there's not enough
blood for both of them.

744
01:11:24.436 --> 01:11:26.436
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

745
01:11:28.557 --> 01:11:30.557
Yep.

746
01:11:31.237 --> 01:11:33.237
OK.

747
01:11:43.197 --> 01:11:45.197
Dad?

748
01:11:45.597 --> 01:11:46.697
Dad?

749
01:11:46.797 --> 01:11:49.055
Yeah.

750
01:11:49.155 --> 01:11:51.095
- I'm finished.
- Good to go?

751
01:11:51.195 --> 01:11:53.195
Yeah.

752
01:12:04.155 --> 01:12:06.155
It's Mum who you
talk to, isn't it?

753
01:12:16.797 --> 01:12:18.217
Wish I could talk to her.

754
01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.676
I miss her.

755
01:12:38.035 --> 01:12:39.435
I gotta find another
place to drink,

756
01:12:39.516 --> 01:12:41.572
every fucker looking at me
like I've got three heads.

757
01:12:41.596 --> 01:12:43.596
I need more money, John.

758
01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:49.332
Alright, son, whatever
I can help you with.

759
01:12:49.356 --> 01:12:51.256
It's not a small amount.

760
01:12:51.356 --> 01:12:53.654
- How much?
- Couple hundred thousand.

761
01:12:53.754 --> 01:12:55.314
I don't even know if
I can pay you back.

762
01:12:55.356 --> 01:12:57.956
It was something Billy
did and I need to…

763
01:12:58.996 --> 01:13:00.456
Sh sh sh.

764
01:13:00.556 --> 01:13:03.276
Hey, I don't need to know.

765
01:13:12.236 --> 01:13:14.236
Corporal…

766
01:13:15.795 --> 01:13:17.795
there's a way to get this done.

767
01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:23.356
But you have to
engage. You understand?

768
01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.615
So you let me know, son.

769
01:13:28.715 --> 01:13:30.135
I'm here.

770
01:13:33.554 --> 01:13:35.554
Let's get it done.

771
01:13:40.435 --> 01:13:42.435
Yeah.

772
01:13:43.236 --> 01:13:45.236
Yeah?

773
01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:47.796
There he is.

774
01:15:09.674 --> 01:15:11.254
Boys.

775
01:15:11.355 --> 01:15:12.694
Search him.

776
01:15:12.794 --> 01:15:14.895
- Let me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

777
01:15:14.995 --> 01:15:16.495
Mate, I haven't got anything.

778
01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.694
Look, nothing.

779
01:15:18.794 --> 01:15:20.794
Nothing here.

780
01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:25.075
Nothing.

781
01:15:26.035 --> 01:15:27.895
Johnny, can you do
us a favour mate?

782
01:15:27.995 --> 01:15:30.794
Please explain to us,
please, why the fuck?!

783
01:15:33.235 --> 01:15:35.334
Are you stupid, man?

784
01:15:35.435 --> 01:15:37.434
Are you slow in the head?

785
01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.034
No.

786
01:15:42.954 --> 01:15:44.954
Because I could.

787
01:15:46.234 --> 01:15:48.214
That's it.

788
01:15:48.314 --> 01:15:51.254
That's your fucking
answer? 'Cause you could?

789
01:15:54.034 --> 01:15:56.035
What do you want me to say?

790
01:15:56.955 --> 01:15:58.955
Because it's dirty money?

791
01:15:59.795 --> 01:16:01.795
'Cause you're drug dealers?

792
01:16:06.275 --> 01:16:08.475
I don't give a fuck
about any of that.

793
01:16:10.594 --> 01:16:12.794
See, I don't have a
moral compass left.

794
01:16:15.554 --> 01:16:17.554
Like I said…

795
01:16:18.594 --> 01:16:21.154
I did it because I could.

796
01:16:22.234 --> 01:16:24.313
Because I am very capable.

797
01:16:26.433 --> 01:16:28.054
Because it was fun.

798
01:16:33.514 --> 01:16:35.654
And 'cause you're
both fucking useless.

799
01:16:37.234 --> 01:16:38.333
Whoa, whoa.

800
01:16:38.433 --> 01:16:40.614
We're not that fucking
useless, Johnny.

801
01:16:40.715 --> 01:16:42.294
We figured it out it was you.

802
01:16:42.394 --> 01:16:43.693
Mm genius.

803
01:16:43.794 --> 01:16:45.794
Yeah, I fucking am.

804
01:16:46.514 --> 01:16:48.294
Now where is it?

805
01:16:48.394 --> 01:16:50.334
- Johnny, where is it?
- It's in the back.

806
01:16:50.434 --> 01:16:51.774
Ned?

807
01:16:56.434 --> 01:16:58.714
Done it this time,
didn't you Johnny? Hm?

808
01:17:01.233 --> 01:17:03.414
We good?

809
01:17:03.514 --> 01:17:05.093
Ned, we good?!

810
01:17:05.193 --> 01:17:07.013
No, we're not fucking
good. It's not here!

811
01:17:09.153 --> 01:17:10.494
You fucking dog cunt!

812
01:17:40.074 --> 01:17:42.114
Come on then!

813
01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:53.433
Oh shit!

814
01:18:07.473 --> 01:18:09.973
- Go! Sniper on the hill!
- What?

815
01:18:10.073 --> 01:18:12.334
Sniper. Fuck!

816
01:18:12.434 --> 01:18:14.434
Fuck!

817
01:18:54.432 --> 01:18:57.073
Please. Please.

818
01:19:16.393 --> 01:19:18.393
You can go home, Corporal.

819
01:19:19.393 --> 01:19:21.393
I'll complete here.

820
01:19:26.153 --> 01:19:28.152
You did good, son.

821
01:19:29.152 --> 01:19:30.611
You're a soldier.

822
01:19:30.712 --> 01:19:33.071
You did what you had
to do, you mopped up.

823
01:19:35.352 --> 01:19:37.352
Just go home, mate.

824
01:19:39.432 --> 01:19:41.432
Hey.

825
01:20:01.952 --> 01:20:03.952
It's not safe anymore.

826
01:20:07.791 --> 01:20:09.791
It's time to go.

827
01:20:27.513 --> 01:20:29.513
We have to
move away from here.

828
01:20:30.752 --> 01:20:33.032
I won't do anything
like that again, I promise.

829
01:20:39.832 --> 01:20:41.692
It's not that.

830
01:20:41.792 --> 01:20:43.411
I'm sorry.

831
01:20:43.511 --> 01:20:47.992
I won't run away ever again.
I just want to stay here.

832
01:20:50.152 --> 01:20:52.152
These boys, they're
not your friends.

833
01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.392
Dad, they're the only
friends I've had.

834
01:21:00.152 --> 01:21:02.152
I'm sorry, Billy.

835
01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:05.531
- Yeah, you're sorry?
- Yeah.

836
01:21:05.631 --> 01:21:08.031
No, you're not. You think
this is my fault don't you?

837
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:11.330
Yeah, yeah, my fault
you left the Army,

838
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:13.592
my fault you can't hold
down a fucking job!

839
01:21:14.712 --> 01:21:16.972
You had to leave the
Army to look after me!

840
01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:18.968
Who else was gonna take
care of me? Mum was gone!

841
01:21:18.992 --> 01:21:21.052
Please don't…

842
01:21:21.152 --> 01:21:22.851
And that's my fault, too.

843
01:21:22.952 --> 01:21:25.331
And you wish she was
still here and not me!

844
01:21:25.431 --> 01:21:27.132
You want to know why I run away?

845
01:21:27.232 --> 01:21:29.211
Because you don't
fucking want me, Dad!

846
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:31.311
Don't say that!

847
01:21:33.672 --> 01:21:35.672
Don't you say that!

848
01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:53.351
I'm sorry.

849
01:22:01.832 --> 01:22:03.832
Get out!

850
01:22:07.151 --> 01:22:09.151
Get out of my fucking room, Dad!

851
01:22:37.431 --> 01:22:39.431
Her brain?

852
01:22:41.151 --> 01:22:44.471
We can't possibly tell the
outcome of her injuries.

853
01:22:51.431 --> 01:22:53.170
My boy?

854
01:22:53.271 --> 01:22:55.411
His head is fine.

855
01:22:55.511 --> 01:22:57.511
But he's bleeding internally.

856
01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:09.591
Mr Logan?

857
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:19.429
You need to make a decision.

858
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:32.330
Fuck!

859
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:33.489
Turn the car off.

860
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:35.126
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

861
01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:37.150
Turn off the car.

862
01:24:44.150 --> 01:24:46.150
In the glove box…

863
01:24:58.149 --> 01:25:00.150
It's all there.

864
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:08.390
Don't think this is a tab
that keeps on running.

865
01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:11.749
It stops now.

866
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:16.150
You have a son.

867
01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:19.729
Just think what you
would do for him.

868
01:25:24.789 --> 01:25:26.789
Don't test me.

869
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:41.229
Jesus fucking Christ.

870
01:25:45.509 --> 01:25:48.170
We've reviewed the CCTV
footage from a traffic lights

871
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:50.350
and run diagnostics
at the scene.

872
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:54.070
The other driver, he crossed
through an intersection

873
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:57.629
on a red light and the
impact was at high speed.

874
01:25:59.150 --> 01:26:01.669
The driver, we tested
his blood alcohol level.

875
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:05.229
He was over the limit.

876
01:26:12.589 --> 01:26:14.589
I'm sorry.

877
01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:24.889
Fuck!

878
01:27:33.269 --> 01:27:36.269

Where's your dad?
Where'd he fucking go?

911
01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.682
- He was here.
- Where's your dad!

912
01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:22.514
Son, where is he?

913
01:30:22.539 --> 01:30:25.187
I just need to talk to
your dad. Where is he?

01:30:25.267 --> 01:30:27.267
Billy! Billy!

915
01:30:27.545 --> 01:30:29.166
Billy, you OK?

916
01:30:29.347 --> 01:30:30.620
Sorry.

917
01:30:30.645 --> 01:30:32.342
He's OK. He's alright.

918
01:30:34.147 --> 01:30:36.147
Get in the room.

919
01:30:40.506 --> 01:30:42.167
What's going on?

920
01:30:42.267 --> 01:30:44.207
They sent a merc for me.
- Close the door, Billy.

921
01:30:44.307 --> 01:30:46.087
Some merc.

922
01:30:48.067 --> 01:30:50.987
He's…he's alright.
He's alright.

923
01:30:51.947 --> 01:30:53.287
That's a problem.

924
01:30:53.387 --> 01:30:55.385
What exactly have
you got me into?

925
01:30:55.977 --> 01:30:58.206
- You didn't want to know.
- Well, now I fucking do!

926
01:30:58.231 --> 01:31:00.402
The fucking safe job, right?
The money we took, alright?

927
01:31:00.426 --> 01:31:02.886
And now, for whatever fucking
reason, more people know.

928
01:31:02.911 --> 01:31:04.047
They know. How
many people know?

929
01:31:04.071 --> 01:31:06.766
I don't know, Corporal.
More than we took care of.

930
01:31:06.867 --> 01:31:08.527
More than we took care of.

931
01:31:08.552 --> 01:31:11.413
Took care of them?
I took care of them.

932
01:31:12.386 --> 01:31:14.487
You told me that
you had the money.

933
01:31:14.512 --> 01:31:16.727
I did have the money.
You came to me.

934
01:31:16.753 --> 01:31:17.973
You came to me for money.

935
01:31:18.147 --> 01:31:20.607
Right, I had the money.
I gave you the money.

936
01:31:20.707 --> 01:31:22.507
Alright, I take them out
and it all goes away.

937
01:31:22.587 --> 01:31:24.487
That's what happened.

938
01:31:24.587 --> 01:31:25.971
That's what happened.

939
01:31:27.593 --> 01:31:28.962
Alright, it's not
a fucking problem.

940
01:31:28.986 --> 01:31:30.362
We do the same as we've
always done, mate,

941
01:31:30.386 --> 01:31:32.726
We lure them in and we shoot.
I'll get rid of all of them.

942
01:31:32.826 --> 01:31:34.446
We get rid of all of them.

943
01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.582
Easy.

944
01:31:41.169 --> 01:31:43.161
Corporal, there's no other way,
mate, there's no other way.

945
01:31:43.185 --> 01:31:46.167
They sent… Look at me!
I got fucking stabbed!

946
01:31:46.192 --> 01:31:47.971
Please?

947
01:31:48.146 --> 01:31:49.367
I had to fucking kill someone.

948
01:31:49.467 --> 01:31:51.526
Some cunts fucking dead in
my fucking house, please?

949
01:31:51.627 --> 01:31:52.887
There's no other way.

950
01:31:52.987 --> 01:31:54.987
Sh sh sh.

951
01:31:59.707 --> 01:32:01.706
Get out, you're on your own.

952
01:32:04.226 --> 01:32:05.566
You owe me!

953
01:32:05.666 --> 01:32:07.046
For what I did!

954
01:32:07.146 --> 01:32:09.325
- You owe me!
- Fucking what?

955
01:32:09.426 --> 01:32:11.126
I don't owe you shit.

956
01:32:11.226 --> 01:32:14.026
I never asked you to do that!

957
01:32:20.106 --> 01:32:22.106
I'm sorry.

958
01:32:22.466 --> 01:32:24.466
I'm sorry.

959
01:32:25.346 --> 01:32:27.486
I'm sorry.

960
01:32:27.586 --> 01:32:29.126
I'm sorry, brother.

961
01:32:29.226 --> 01:32:31.227
I'm so sorry.

962
01:32:35.266 --> 01:32:36.406
I'm sorry.

963
01:32:42.026 --> 01:32:43.326
Sorry.

964
01:32:43.426 --> 01:32:44.966
Alright. Alright. Shh.

965
01:32:51.426 --> 01:32:53.426
Come on. Come here.

966
01:32:54.786 --> 01:32:57.846
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.

967
01:33:02.506 --> 01:33:04.506
I'm sorry.

968
01:33:38.385 --> 01:33:40.385
Get back in the room!

969
01:33:47.184 --> 01:33:49.184
What are we doing?

970
01:33:54.305 --> 01:33:56.305
Johnny…

971
01:33:57.505 --> 01:33:59.505
Stop it Johnny.

972
01:36:04.784 --> 01:36:06.784
You're finished.

973
01:36:10.504 --> 01:36:12.504
It looks beautiful.

974
01:36:37.824 --> 01:36:39.824
Thank you, Dad.

975
01:36:42.424 --> 01:36:44.424
For what?

976
01:36:46.224 --> 01:36:48.224
The sandwich.

977
01:37:14.664 --> 01:37:16.084
Come on.

978
01:37:16.184 --> 01:37:17.723
- Alright, you good?
- Yeah.

979
01:37:17.823 --> 01:37:19.823
You want to sit between my legs?

980
01:37:26.224 --> 01:37:28.223
Alright.

981
01:37:30.063 --> 01:37:32.063
Come on. Come on.

982
01:37:36.423 --> 01:37:38.423
Check your mirror.

983
01:37:47.023 --> 01:37:49.083
Easy on the clutch.

984
01:37:49.184 --> 01:37:50.603
Yeah.

985
01:37:59.583 --> 01:38:01.583
Go on.
