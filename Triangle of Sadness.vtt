00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:52.386
So, what are the most important
aspects of being a male model?

2
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.354
I would say: look good.

3
00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.324
Yes? And?

4
00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.761
- Er, that's it.
- And walk!

5
00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:03.330
Look good and walk?
But not at the same time, right?

6
00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.167
- Most of the times at the same
time. - Really? Can you do that?

7
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.338
- Er, sure. - Please show us!
Yes, yes, go ahead.

8
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.106
Whoo! Yeah!

9
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.315
Thank you. Next!

10
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.285
Okay...
Hello, hello, hello.

11
00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:28.756
What do we have here?

12
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.725
- Hey, there.
- What's up, man?

13
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:34.328
So, I want to know, did your
parents support you in being a
male model?

14
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.296
All the way, right from the
start.

15
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.433
- Even your father?
- Even my father, yeah. Why?

16
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:43.337
He wanted you to enter this
industry where you earn only 1/3
of the women,

17
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.673
where you constantly have
to maneuver homosexual men

18
00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:47.675
who want to sleep with you?

19
00:01:55.617 --> 00:01:58.653
'I'm Lewis Taylor, and I'm
standing here with my very best
friend...'

20
00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:00.420
- What was your name?
- Er, Carl.

21
00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:01.689
My best friend Carl!

22
00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:04.491
- How are you today, Carl?
- Yeah, good, good.

23
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:08.796
So, is this runway casting for a
grumpy brand or a smiley brand?

24
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.365
Er, I don't know, man. I don't
know.

25
00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:13.901
Well, smiley brands
are the cheap ones,

26
00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:16.470
and the more expensive the brand
gets,

27
00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.906
you start to look down
on your consumer.

28
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.409
Like, if you want to be a part
of this "von oben" one-man
in-crowd,

29
00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.545
you have to show us
some serious cash.

30
00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.583
- So it's a grumpy brand, yeah?
- Congratulations! I'm so happy
for you!

31
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:31.586
And if you get the job, you will
get to wear exclusive clothing,

32
00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.821
and look down on your consumer.

33
00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:35.923
Okay, Carl. Show us some of that
grumpy look.

34
00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:38.660
- No, no...
- Yeah, let's go!

35
00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.695
Come on, Carl! You can do it.

36
00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:44.932
Yes! "Don't you dare talk to me!

37
00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:48.603
"I'm an Aryan 'Übermensch', too
obsessed with the image of
myself

38
00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:53.407
"to be involved with anything
that doesn't fit my stylized
image of the world."

39
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.909
Wait...

40
00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:57.945
"Suddenly, I'm dressed
in something way less expensive.

41
00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.747
"It's H&M!"

42
00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:01.281
Everybody, come together!

43
00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:05.520
"You can too be a part of this
happy, smiling group of mixed
skin colors,

44
00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:08.956
"for not that much money!
#friendship, #everyonesequal,

45
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.426
"#happylife,
#stopclimatechange."

46
00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.430
Oh, no!
Oh! I am so sorry, darling.

47
00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:20.434
I didn't see that it was
Balenciaga you're wearing.

48
00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:23.437
"We are strong and tough
and unapproachable!"

49
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.506
Show me that Balenciaga look!

50
00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:30.277
Oh, I'm sorry,
I think it's back to H&M again!

51
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.848
"Yeah! We're just kidding.
We're so cheap, we're so happy!"

52
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.850
Everybody, come closer together!

53
00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:38.953
Balenciaga is back!
Ooh, fiercer than ever!

54
00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.755
"We are stone cold.

55
00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:43.356
"Yes!
Oh, my God, get away from us!"

56
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.392
H&M is here again!

57
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.627
Balenciaga!

58
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.795
And H&M!

59
00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.262
Balenciaga!

60
00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.965
And H&M!

61
00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.467
Oh, everybody,
give it up for these guys!

62
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.571
Fabulous! Fabulous, Carl!

63
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.646
Here...

64
00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:08.482
- Hi.
- Hello.

65
00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:10.551
How are you guys doing?

66
00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:24.699
- Oh, it's you?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:26.768
You can hardly tell
it's the same guy.

68
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.401
How old is
this perfume campaign?

69
00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:31.338
When was it?
Er, three years ago.

70
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:35.543
- And then maybe a year after
that. - Okay...

71
00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:37.779
So you do castings again, then?

72
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.447
Yeah.

73
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.650
Could you do
a little walk for us?

74
00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:46.621
Er... Just quick.
No smiling. No stopping.

75
00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:47.922
Yeah.

76
00:04:57.632 --> 00:04:59.066
One more time.

77
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.437
Okay.

78
00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:09.744
Okay...

79
00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:14.682
Today, fashion is not just about
surface. It's about the inside.

80
00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:17.819
Think about a tune that you like
when you walk.

81
00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:19.554
Look at me.

82
00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:30.497
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, so like a rhythm?

83
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:32.399
Yeah. Go!

84
00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:46.681
Can you relax your Triangle of
Sadness?

85
00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:50.518
- It's like between your
eyebrows here. - Okay.

86
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:52.653
A little bit more...

87
00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:56.123
Okay. And open your mouth so you
look a little bit more
available.

88
00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.862
Okay, not that much. A little
bit less.

89
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.431
Okay. Thank you very much.

90
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.502
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

91
00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:10.037
Next, please!

92
00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.880
- Hi!
- Hi.

93
00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:47.041
♪ Yeah, man-made powers,
Stood like a tower

94
00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:49.677

- Sorry?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.276
- I don't have a seat now. - Can
you just...? There's a seat.

100
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.079
Just right up there.
Yeah. Just there.

101
00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:21.028
Yaya! Yaya!

102
00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:29.170
Yaya, look here.
Look here, Yaya!

103
00:09:31.272 --> 00:09:32.907
Yaya!

104
00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:36.277
Yaya!

105
00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:55.796
Thank you, sir.

106
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.645
Thank you, honey.

107
00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.914
That's so sweet of you.

108
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.262
Do you like the place?

109
00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:30.831
- A little stuffy?
- A little stuffy.

110
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.406
What?

111
00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:44.912
I don't know, you looked like
you were thinking there.

112
00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.747
No, I'm not. I'm not.

113
00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:50.084
Cool.

114
00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:55.256
I can tell there's something's
wrong. Just talk to me, what is
it?

115
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:02.029
No, it's just...

116
00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:03.764
When you say...

117
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:08.235
When you say,
"Thank you, honey" like that...

118
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:10.871
You don't really give me an
option but to pay.

119
00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:15.876
It was just an observation.
Just something I've noticed.

120
00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:22.816
- We can split the bill if you
like. - No, no...

121
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.253
- I can whip out a calculator...
- No, no, okay.

122
00:11:26.287 --> 00:11:28.255
- How many glasses of wine did
you have? - Oh, sure...

123
00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:31.258
- You had, like, three more.
- That's not what I mean.

124
00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:33.861
Yeah, I think it all evens out,
you know.

125
00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:36.697
Hmm...

126
00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:40.167
Don't you remember last night?
You said you were gonna...

127
00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:44.238
You said you were gonna pay
for food today.

128
00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:49.877
At the end of the meal, you
said, "Thanks. Tomorrow I'll get
it."

129
00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:54.181
Sure, but then you picked up the
bill,

130
00:11:54.215 --> 00:11:56.784
and I thought you wanted to pay,
so I said, "Thank you, honey."

131
00:11:56.817 --> 00:12:00.821
- But it was there for such a
long time... - I didn't see it.

132
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:06.327
- You didn't see it?
- I, er...

133
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.096
No, I didn't. I didn't see it.

134
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:12.433
Or I didn't notice it. We were
just having a nice dinner.

135
00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:18.205
You didn't see the bill
when it got put on the table?

136
00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:20.241
No, I didn't, Carl.

137
00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:30.518
So the waiter came in, and put
it in the middle of the table
just there.

138
00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:33.387
- And you didn't happen to see
it? - Oh, my God!

139
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.491
What? I'm asking you
seriously now, because...

140
00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:39.059
Wow...

141
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:41.862
What's... What's "wow"?

142
00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.135
What are you doing?

143
00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:51.805
No, no, no. Just don't... Wait.
Can you sit down? Sit down.

144
00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:55.242
I'm just trying to figure out
what exactly I did wrong!

145
00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:59.913
- Seriously? - Calm down.
Please, just sit down.

146
00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:03.518
- You're fighting over money!
- No! That's not what's...

147
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:07.421
- That's literally what's
happening. - I'm just pointing
out the fact that...

148
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.923
- Why are you so obsessed with
money? - I'm not obsessed.

149
00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:13.160
Can you just sit down, please?
I'm not obsessed with money.

150
00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:16.564
It was just an observation from
yesterday. Can you please sit
down?

151
00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:30.411
- No, no, no... What are you
doing? - It's fine.

152
00:13:33.047 --> 00:13:35.550
Well, you can't pay now,
that's ridiculous.

153
00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:38.185
- Don't, Carl.
- What are you doing?

154
00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:41.021
- Let go. - No, no, no... I'm
paying the bill.

155
00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:44.559
That's not why I said it.

156
00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:50.898
- Sorry. - Are we
enjoying ourselves?

157
00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:54.636
Yes, thanks, yeah.
Yaya...

158
00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:57.104
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

159
00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:14.321
Now I feel bad.

160
00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:17.024
Why? I make more money than you.

161
00:14:27.669 --> 00:14:31.905
Excuse me.
Your card didn't work.

162
00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:36.343
- Do you have another one,
maybe? - Can you try it again,
please?

163
00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:39.514
I tried it twice.

164
00:14:41.982 --> 00:14:44.652
- I'm sorry, we don't accept that one.
-  - Just take this one.

165
00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:47.054
Carl! Just give me a second.
Just wait!

166
00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:49.123
- Let me pay.
- Just wait!

167
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.296
It's fine, you don't have enough
cash. Take that.

168
00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:59.400
- You accept that one, yeah?
- Yes.

169
00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:02.202
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

170
00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:34.101
Thank you.

171
00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:21.281
I do think it's quite crazy how
it's such a hard thing to talk
about.

172
00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:23.984
Money.

173
00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:30.357
It's such a touchy subject.
Don't you think?

174
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.393
Yeah, I think it's un-sexy
to talk about money.

175
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:42.135
Okay, but then why is that?

176
00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:44.706
I don't know, it's just not
sexy.

177
00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:48.175
Well, you don't think it's
because it's so tied to gender
roles?

178
00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:52.514
Fuckin' hell, the menu in the
restaurant didn't even have
prices for you.

179
00:16:52.547 --> 00:16:54.582
That's not fair, Carl.

180
00:16:54.616 --> 00:16:58.786
- I'm always paying. - No, no,
no, let's take you out of it
here.

181
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.488
And just talk about women in
general.

182
00:17:02.524 --> 00:17:06.193
I'm a generous person, Carl.
Ask any of my friends.

183
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.397
Sure you're generous, but...

184
00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:15.235
But?

185
00:17:16.638 --> 00:17:20.173
When it comes to you and me,
we're dealing with roles that I
hate.

186
00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:22.510
I don't want to be the man,
whilst you're the woman,

187
00:17:22.544 --> 00:17:24.512
I want us to be best friends.

188
00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:27.615
- I don't wanna sleep with my
best friend. - No, that's not...

189
00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:30.718
You don't understand what I'm
trying to say. I mean...

190
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:33.420
We shouldn't just slip into the
stereotypical gender-based roles

191
00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:35.723
that everyone else seems to be
doing.

192
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.362
I want us to be equal.

193
00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:56.276
Excuse me?

194
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.246
- You have to fight.
- I'm sorry, what?

195
00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:02.149
If you love her, you have to
fight for her.

196
00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:03.851
I've been there, I know.

197
00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:06.788
If you don't fight,
you're gonna be her slave.

198
00:18:09.591 --> 00:18:12.827
The thing is, Yaya, I like to
take you for dinner. I enjoy
paying for you.

199
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.797
But there comes a point
where I do feel used.

200
00:18:16.631 --> 00:18:17.865
I use you?

201
00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:20.835
Well, I'm just referring to my
feelings now, but sure, if we...

202
00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:23.571
No, no. Just wait. If we go back
the last week or so,

203
00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:25.807
then, yeah, maybe there is a
point...

204
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.575
Are you being serious?

205
00:18:27.609 --> 00:18:29.777
I got you this shirt.
I invited you for dinner.

206
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:33.480
- You're staying at my hotel. -
Well, you got this shirt for
free.

207
00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:37.685
- And actually you didn't pay
for dinner. - That's because my
card didn't work.

208
00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:40.922
There's a cash machine in the
lobby. I'll pay you back every
last cent...

209
00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:42.857
It's okay.

210
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.759
Carl, I always intended
to pay you back.

211
00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:48.896
I didn't realize you wanted the
money right now before going to
bed.

212
00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:53.635
- So your intention was to pay
me back? - Yes.

213
00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:56.403
- Really?
- Yeah.

214
00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.906
So why did you take
the 50-euro bill?

215
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.211
Once I realized you didn't have
enough cash, I paid the bill.

216
00:19:04.244 --> 00:19:07.815
Instead of giving me the 50-euro
bill, you put it back in your
purse.

217
00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:11.653
What? I'm just saying what
happened, Yaya.

218
00:19:12.654 --> 00:19:14.421
What are you...? Don't!

219
00:19:16.557 --> 00:19:18.960
What the fuck are you doing?

220
00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:21.596
Don't fucking do that to me!

221
00:19:21.629 --> 00:19:24.799
Don't... fucking do that to me,
Yaya!

222
00:19:24.832 --> 00:19:27.434
Don't do that to me!

223
00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:30.437
- 'Going down.' - Don't fucking
shove things down me!

224
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.906
- You fucking child!
- Seriously...

225
00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:33.306
You're behaving like a crazy
person.

226
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.208
Shut up!
Don't do things like that to me!

227
00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:36.811
What the hell are you doing
with my money?

228
00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:40.548
Your money? Oh, my God!
It's not about money, Yaya!

229
00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:41.983
It's not about...

230
00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:47.454
It's not about the fucking
money, Yaya!

231
00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:49.356
- Oh!
- This is... No, it's not!

232
00:19:49.389 --> 00:19:52.225
You're not understanding the
point! It's not about the money!

233
00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:54.762
I'll give you that 50 euros!
I'll give you a 100 euros!

234
00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:56.931
- Oh, yeah?
- No! I'm serious now!

235
00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:59.767
This is not about the fucking
money! Why won't you understand
it?

236
00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:01.969
Understand my point!

237
00:20:02.804 --> 00:20:04.872
This is not about the money!

238
00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:08.876
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay.
- I want it to be equal, Yaya!

239
00:20:10.578 --> 00:20:13.748
Thought he might be
dangerous, but he just looked
like...

240
00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:20.420
Bullshit feminist.

241
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.575
For fuck's...

242
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:21.374
- What have you been doing?
- Trying to sleep on a chair.

243
00:22:21.408 --> 00:22:24.411
- How'd that go?
- Well, I'm back.

244
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:28.883
What have you been doing?

245
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:32.086
I was... walking up and down
the corridor and...

246
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.890
- Texting you multiple times.
- Hmm, a lot...

247
00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:39.060
- You saw them?
- Yeah.

248
00:22:44.165 --> 00:22:46.601
- This is so silly.
- Yeah.

249
00:22:49.103 --> 00:22:51.973
I'm... so good at being...

250
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.407
...manipulative.

251
00:22:56.443 --> 00:23:00.081
I don't know, I do it and I
don't even realize that I'm
doing it.

252
00:23:01.048 --> 00:23:03.416
- Yeah...
- I love you.

253
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:08.421
No, but seriously, it's amazing
that you can tell me that.

254
00:23:08.455 --> 00:23:10.457
Now you're a generous person.

255
00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:13.561
Okay.

256
00:23:14.795 --> 00:23:16.063
Alright.

257
00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:24.672
Ask me anything.

258
00:23:24.705 --> 00:23:26.540
You sure?

259
00:23:26.574 --> 00:23:27.808
Uh-huh.

260
00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:33.547
In the restaurant, with the
bill...

261
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:35.516
What about it?

262
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:38.653
You intentionally
didn't pick that up, right?

263
00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:40.388
- Yes.
- Of course.

264
00:23:43.891 --> 00:23:46.193
Didn't that embarrass you?

265
00:23:47.228 --> 00:23:48.663
Nope.

266
00:23:50.164 --> 00:23:52.767
- But you make more money than I
do. - It's not about the money.

267
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.802
And you said you were gonna
pay...

268
00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:04.578
It doesn't really matter
who makes more money.

269
00:24:04.612 --> 00:24:06.681
What is it about, then?

270
00:24:07.949 --> 00:24:09.617
What if I...

271
00:24:10.518 --> 00:24:12.485
...fall pregnant?

272
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.854
With me?

273
00:24:15.222 --> 00:24:19.961
What if I fall pregnant
and I can't go on working?

274
00:24:19.994 --> 00:24:23.631
I need to know that the person
I'm with intends to take care of
me.

275
00:24:23.664 --> 00:24:25.666
Otherwise I'm wasting my time.

276
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.740
Yeah, I guess you're not the
kind to work in...

277
00:24:32.773 --> 00:24:35.109
...a restaurant
or a supermarket, are you?

278
00:24:35.142 --> 00:24:37.244
No offense.

279
00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:40.581
I'm a model, honey, the only way
for me to get out of this life

280
00:24:40.614 --> 00:24:43.651
is to become
someone's trophy wife.

281
00:24:45.152 --> 00:24:47.888
So, there's nothing else to this
for you?

282
00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:50.591
Other than...

283
00:24:51.859 --> 00:24:55.229
...increasing the followers on
our Instagram, and all of that.

284
00:24:55.262 --> 00:24:57.865
- It make sense, doesn't it?
- Sure.

285
00:24:57.898 --> 00:25:00.768
I like you. You like me.
It's good for business.

286
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:02.003
Yeah.

287
00:25:03.304 --> 00:25:04.939
- Nothing more?
- Uh-hmm.

288
00:25:04.972 --> 00:25:06.841
- Uh-hmm?
- Uh-hmm.

289
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.212
I'd like to put a bet on that.

290
00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:13.748
Okay.

291
00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:16.617
- Deal.
- Yeah.

292
00:25:20.788 --> 00:25:22.156
We'll see.

293
00:25:23.591 --> 00:25:25.593
I'll make you love me.

294
00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:29.163
- It'll be real love as well.
- Oh, yeah?

295
00:25:29.196 --> 00:25:31.599
- Yep.
- Okay.

296
00:25:31.632 --> 00:25:34.101
You'll forget about this trophy
shit.

297
00:25:34.135 --> 00:25:35.803
And you'll love me.

298
00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:36.263
'The success of a luxury
cruise mainly depends on two
moments.

299
00:26:37.364 --> 00:26:40.935
'Number one: the first hours
the guests are onboard.

300
00:26:41.936 --> 00:26:45.005
'And number two: the last day
the guests are onboard.

301
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.742
'And if we can impress them
on those two occasions,

302
00:26:48.776 --> 00:26:51.378
'then the cruise will probably
be a success.'

303
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.748
And I don't want to hear
anybody saying,

304
00:26:54.782 --> 00:26:59.186
"We don't need to uncover the
sundeck, they all leave after
breakfast."

305
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.290
No. I want full set-up
every morning.

306
00:27:03.324 --> 00:27:04.859
No excuses.

307
00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.962
Not even for the last hour.

308
00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.967
It's always,
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

309
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.302
If there is an illegal substance
they want, or...

310
00:27:16.303 --> 00:27:18.005
...a unicorn!

311
00:27:18.038 --> 00:27:20.274
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

312
00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:21.942
- Yes!
- Whoo!

313
00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:24.378
Yes!

314
00:27:26.213 --> 00:27:28.949
I know, I know what it is
to work for service.

315
00:27:28.983 --> 00:27:31.385
I know all the challenges
you're facing.

316
00:27:32.419 --> 00:27:36.290
But at these times, I ask of you
to keep that chin up.

317
00:27:36.323 --> 00:27:40.094
Stay strong.

318
00:27:40.127 --> 00:27:42.663
And try to remind yourself...

319
00:27:44.331 --> 00:27:46.767
...if everything goes well...

320
00:27:47.434 --> 00:27:50.237
...at the end of the cruise...

321
00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:52.873
- Money, money, money...
- ...you might be getting...

322
00:27:52.907 --> 00:27:57.211
- ...a very generous tip!
- Money, money, money...

323
00:28:02.016 --> 00:28:04.885
Money! Money! Money!

324
00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:08.355
Money! Money!
Money! Money! Money!

325
00:28:16.397 --> 00:28:18.265
- Money!
- Yes!

326
00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:20.868
Alicia, who do we have onboard?

327
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:25.739
No...

328
00:28:29.443 --> 00:28:31.879
- Housekeeping!
- No. No, thank you.

329
00:28:34.114 --> 00:28:36.784
- Do you want me to clean the
room? - No, thanks.

330
00:28:36.817 --> 00:28:38.986
Okay, I'll come back in 30
minutes?

331
00:28:39.019 --> 00:28:41.989
- No, you can come back a bit
later. - Okay, one hour?

332
00:28:42.022 --> 00:28:44.358
Could you just
come back later, please?

333
00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:47.461
Okay, I'll come back later.
Sorry, ma'am.

334
00:28:56.337 --> 00:28:58.272
Let me change.

335
00:30:11.211 --> 00:30:13.113
What?

336
00:30:13.147 --> 00:30:14.415
Nothing.

337
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.055
- Hey!
- Hey.

338
00:30:27.995 --> 00:30:30.130
- What are you doing?
- What?

339
00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:35.135
- Are you talking to the crew?
- Yeah...

340
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.907
- Why are you talking to the
crew? - I said hello.

341
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.209
Yeah, you smiled at him
and said hello.

342
00:30:43.277 --> 00:30:45.312
- So?
- Ah...

343
00:30:56.924 --> 00:30:59.594
Seriously, Yaya, we're sitting
here together, you shouldn't...

344
00:30:59.627 --> 00:31:02.262
- You just don't do that.
- Do what?

345
00:31:03.565 --> 00:31:08.135
If I started smiling
at the hot stewardess and...

346
00:31:08.168 --> 00:31:10.170
- You know...
- You think she's hot?

347
00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:16.377
No, but if she was,
and I started smiling at her,

348
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.046
and giggling and saying,
"Hey," like you did,

349
00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:21.081
then you wouldn't like it, would
you?

350
00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:23.984
- Are you jealous?
- No.

351
00:31:24.017 --> 00:31:26.887
- No? - No, I'm not. I'm not.
It's just like...

352
00:31:28.656 --> 00:31:30.658
I mean, come on, look at you.
And then...

353
00:31:31.492 --> 00:31:34.428
And then a hot guy turns up.
I mean, he shouldn't be...

354
00:31:34.461 --> 00:31:36.330
Do you think he's hot?

355
00:31:37.398 --> 00:31:38.966
He's alright.

356
00:31:40.535 --> 00:31:42.236
- Do you?
- Yeah!

357
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.306
- What the fuck, man? - You just
said you thought he was hot!

358
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.344
But come on, you don't have
to... You said it very quickly.
Jesus!

359
00:31:52.246 --> 00:31:54.114
Drop it, okay?

360
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.669
Can I help you, sir?

361
00:32:47.702 --> 00:32:49.671
- Sorry, just quickly...
- Yes?

362
00:32:49.704 --> 00:32:53.006
I was on the rear deck, and one
of your crew members was...

363
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.576
- ...bare-chested.
- Really?

364
00:32:54.609 --> 00:32:56.477
Yeah, and like smoking and
stuff.

365
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:58.546
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's so inappropriate.

366
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.448
- Yeah, it did feel a little
bit... - No, of course.

367
00:33:01.482 --> 00:33:03.350
I'll take care of that. I'm so
sorry.

368
00:33:03.383 --> 00:33:06.119
- Maybe it's not a big issue...
- No, but it's not acceptable
here.

369
00:33:06.153 --> 00:33:09.223
I thought I'd just let you know,
cos... Yeah, I didn't wanna make
anything of it.

370
00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:11.358
Well, thank you so much.
It won't happen again, sir.

371
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:13.393
- I promise you that.
- Alright, thanks.

372
00:33:14.394 --> 00:33:16.230
- Alicia?
- Yeah?

373
00:33:16.263 --> 00:33:19.333
There's a crew member
up on deck with no shirt on.

374
00:33:19.366 --> 00:33:20.702
- No shirt on?
- Yes.

375
00:33:30.678 --> 00:33:32.580
Sorry. Just, er...

376
00:33:32.614 --> 00:33:33.581
Yes?

377
00:33:33.615 --> 00:33:38.051
Is it possible to look
at the engagement rings?

378
00:33:38.085 --> 00:33:40.588
- Yes. Yes, of course!
- Is that alright?

379
00:33:40.622 --> 00:33:44.191
Definitely, yes. Okay.

380
00:33:44.224 --> 00:33:47.662
This is a beautiful ring.
This is 24-carat gold.

381
00:33:47.695 --> 00:33:50.197
And we have a point nine
diamond in the middle,

382
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.835
and we have four brilliants
on every side of the band.

383
00:33:53.868 --> 00:33:57.371
- It's a very beautiful ring.
- Yes. It's really nice.

384
00:33:57.404 --> 00:34:00.240
Do you want me to try it on
so you can see it on a hand?

385
00:34:00.274 --> 00:34:01.676
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- Yeah?

386
00:34:01.709 --> 00:34:04.044
- If you don't mind?
- No, of course.

387
00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:08.550
Hmm...

388
00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:14.856
Yeah?

389
00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:18.292
It's a very nice diamond, this
one. It's a flawless diamond.

390
00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:21.629
What was the price of that one?

391
00:34:21.663 --> 00:34:24.799
This one is... 28,000 euros.

392
00:34:28.168 --> 00:34:29.504
Mm-hmm...

393
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.746
'Can we get an almond
latte to foredeck?'

394
00:34:52.694 --> 00:34:54.562
Captain?

395
00:34:57.799 --> 00:35:00.167
Uh, yes?

396
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.671
I just wanted to tell you
it's time for the safety drill.

397
00:35:03.705 --> 00:35:05.773
Uh, well, no, I'm...

398
00:35:05.807 --> 00:35:08.108
I'm just not feeling well.

399
00:35:09.309 --> 00:35:12.780
- Should I get the doctor?
- No, no, I'll be fine.

400
00:35:12.814 --> 00:35:16.216
Just have the First take care of
it, and then...

401
00:35:16.818 --> 00:35:18.886
...you know, I'll see you later.

402
00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:22.456
Okay!

403
00:35:22.489 --> 00:35:24.291
- Okay.
- Okay.

404
00:35:27.729 --> 00:35:30.898
Abigail? Could you get the tray?
Thank you.

405
00:35:38.906 --> 00:35:42.275
Honey, Nutella.

406
00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:43.544
Hm-mm...

407
00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:46.246
Another one?

408
00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:53.821
Have a little look.

409
00:35:56.858 --> 00:36:00.360
- Aren't you going to eat
the pasta? - Sorry?

410
00:36:01.896 --> 00:36:05.165
Aren't you going to eat the
pasta?

411
00:36:06.634 --> 00:36:09.837
Oh, er...
No. I'm gluten intolerant.

412
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:10.905
Oh?

413
00:36:10.938 --> 00:36:14.575
It's just for the pictures.
She's an influencer.

414
00:36:14.609 --> 00:36:16.511
- Oh!
- Okay.

415
00:36:16.544 --> 00:36:17.879
Wow!

416
00:36:19.446 --> 00:36:21.582
You make money from that?

417
00:36:21.616 --> 00:36:25.620
- Champagne, sir?
- Nah... White wine.

418
00:36:25.653 --> 00:36:29.657
- Sorry, what?
- Yeah... It depends.

419
00:36:29.691 --> 00:36:33.695
It depends. You mostly get free
stuff, to be honest.

420
00:36:34.629 --> 00:36:36.664
We got this cruise for free.

421
00:36:38.298 --> 00:36:42.603
Good! Her looks paid for the
tickets. Not bad, huh?

422
00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:47.742
- Good, huh?
- I guess so, yeah. It did.

423
00:36:47.775 --> 00:36:50.310
- A lovely couple, huh?
- Yeah, that's nice.

424
00:36:50.343 --> 00:36:53.380
- Not bad, not bad.
- Thank you.

425
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.919
So, what do you do?

426
00:36:59.286 --> 00:37:01.388
I sell shit.

427
00:37:02.489 --> 00:37:04.692
- What, sorry?
- I sell shit!

428
00:37:06.894 --> 00:37:11.465
- Fertilizer for
agriculture. - Oh, fertilizer...

429
00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:15.469
- Interesting. - In every
business it's the right place...

430
00:37:15.503 --> 00:37:18.573
...in the right moment.
My right place: east Europe.

431
00:37:18.606 --> 00:37:22.375
Right moment: end of 80s,
beginning of 90s.

432
00:37:22.409 --> 00:37:23.811
And, er...

433
00:37:23.845 --> 00:37:26.681
So, business start, yeah?

434
00:37:26.714 --> 00:37:30.051
- In 80s, I was...
- Baby? Can I have this one?

435
00:37:30.084 --> 00:37:31.853
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

436
00:37:31.886 --> 00:37:33.621
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

437
00:37:33.654 --> 00:37:35.288
- Yeah.
- Love you.

438
00:37:35.322 --> 00:37:38.926
Yeah, yeah...
So, in the beginning of 80s,

439
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.863
I was only CEO

440
00:37:41.896 --> 00:37:46.333
in one agriculture "Kombinat",
we called it.

441
00:37:46.366 --> 00:37:50.470
Hundred thousand pigs,
two million chickens.

442
00:37:50.505 --> 00:37:54.441
And we're getting
some kind of monopoly.

443
00:37:54.474 --> 00:37:57.410
You can call me the King of the
Shit!

444
00:37:57.444 --> 00:37:59.814
- It was...
- I love him. I love him!

445
00:37:59.847 --> 00:38:01.916
And when you have money,
you know,

446
00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:05.385
you don't leave money to sleep,
you understand?

447
00:38:05.418 --> 00:38:07.955
- Money must not sleep, you
know. - Okay.

448
00:38:07.989 --> 00:38:11.893
So you put this money
from this business,

449
00:38:11.926 --> 00:38:16.363
because factories shutting
down...

450
00:38:18.398 --> 00:38:20.835
And the desert is
tiramisu.

451
00:38:21.501 --> 00:38:24.304
Or panna cotta, you like both of
those.

452
00:38:26.908 --> 00:38:30.377
- Oh... you choose.
- A-ha...

453
00:38:31.512 --> 00:38:34.081
You have the panna cotta,
I'll have a tiramisu.

454
00:38:34.115 --> 00:38:35.650
Fine.

455
00:38:39.954 --> 00:38:41.421
Hello!

456
00:38:45.626 --> 00:38:46.894
Cheers.

457
00:38:52.133 --> 00:38:57.004
I'm Clementine.
And this is my husband, Winston.

458
00:38:57.038 --> 00:38:59.006
We're from Great Britain.

459
00:39:12.687 --> 00:39:15.590
My name is Clementine.

460
00:39:15.623 --> 00:39:17.725
- And this is my husband,
Winston. - Winston.

461
00:39:17.758 --> 00:39:19.560
We're from Great Britain.

462
00:39:23.496 --> 00:39:26.634
Hello. This is my wife,
Therese.

463
00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:30.037
She understands you perfectly,
but my wife had a stroke.

464
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:33.574
Since then, she's suffering
from a disability of speaking.

465
00:39:43.684 --> 00:39:45.119
"In den... In den..."

466
00:39:48.222 --> 00:39:50.725
In den Wol...?

467
00:39:52.059 --> 00:39:53.995
- Wolken.
- Wo...

468
00:39:54.028 --> 00:39:55.897
- Champagne, sir?
- No, thank you.

469
00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.166
- What does it mean?
- "Up in the clouds."

470
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.168
Oh! How beautiful.

471
00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:10.912
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

472
00:40:10.945 --> 00:40:12.479
Take care.

473
00:40:15.182 --> 00:40:19.153
Nice to meet you, my friend.
 I hope I work with you again.

474
00:40:19.186 --> 00:40:21.188
It was a pleasure, Mario.

475
00:40:22.957 --> 00:40:24.992
- We're going to miss you.
- Miss you already.

476
00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:27.028
- Take care.
- Take care, you.

477
00:41:07.034 --> 00:41:08.869
Look at that.

478
00:41:11.172 --> 00:41:12.974
Sad, huh?

479
00:41:16.777 --> 00:41:18.713
He's hunting.

480
00:41:18.746 --> 00:41:20.915
- Huh?
- He's hunting!

481
00:41:22.717 --> 00:41:24.085
Big dilemma.

482
00:41:25.186 --> 00:41:28.589
Should he take risk,
or go to the room, huh?

483
00:41:32.093 --> 00:41:33.527
Come on.

484
00:41:36.797 --> 00:41:38.566
Look, look!

485
00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:41.268
Maybe has a little chance!

486
00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:06.894
Amazing...

487
00:42:10.097 --> 00:42:11.632
Wow.

488
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:16.303
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

489
00:42:16.337 --> 00:42:19.140
Er... could you just do me a
favor?

490
00:42:20.341 --> 00:42:23.010
I have this girl,
who should be here with me,

491
00:42:23.044 --> 00:42:25.913
but couldn't come and...

492
00:42:25.946 --> 00:42:28.949
...I would like to take a
picture. Please.

493
00:42:30.084 --> 00:42:32.987
- Can you take my picture?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

494
00:42:34.755 --> 00:42:36.624
I'll stand over here.

495
00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:39.760
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

496
00:42:49.804 --> 00:42:51.238
Good?

497
00:42:51.272 --> 00:42:54.809
- Thank you very much.
- A pleasure...

498
00:42:54.842 --> 00:42:57.278
- Have a nice evening.
- Yeah, you, too.

499
00:43:02.316 --> 00:43:04.585
Excuse me? Mister?

500
00:43:05.352 --> 00:43:09.023
Hi! Eh...
Can you please come back?

501
00:43:11.759 --> 00:43:13.761
You can leave your beer, it's
okay.

502
00:43:13.794 --> 00:43:16.263
- What?
- You can leave your beer.

503
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.735
- If you come in the middle...
- Yeah?

504
00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:23.804
Then we can take a picture
together, the three of us.

505
00:43:23.838 --> 00:43:26.140
Okay, nice! Nice!

506
00:43:26.173 --> 00:43:27.942
Yeah!

507
00:43:27.975 --> 00:43:29.977
- Now we're talking!
- Yeah!

508
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.416
More boobs, Yaya!
More boobs!

509
00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:37.184
Oh...

510
00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:42.089
Thank you very much!
You're very generous!

511
00:43:43.324 --> 00:43:46.093
I would like to do something
generous to you.

512
00:43:46.127 --> 00:43:48.162
They have Rolex watches
in the reception.

513
00:43:48.195 --> 00:43:50.731
We can go down there now, and I
will buy you Rolex watches!

514
00:43:50.764 --> 00:43:53.100
- No, it's okay. Thank you.
- No! I would like...

515
00:43:53.134 --> 00:43:55.402
It may sound strange, but I'm...

516
00:43:55.436 --> 00:43:59.240
What you just did here,
it meant so much to me.

517
00:43:59.273 --> 00:44:01.342
So I can...

518
00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:03.210
I'm very rich.

519
00:44:03.244 --> 00:44:06.881
Yes, let's not beat around the
bush. I'm very rich.

520
00:44:06.914 --> 00:44:08.816
- How rich are you?
- Oh, I'm so...

521
00:44:08.849 --> 00:44:12.786
I'm so fucking rich!
I just sold my company.

522
00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.891
Yeah, I'm not drunk! I
told you, I'm not feeling well.

523
00:44:16.924 --> 00:44:20.761
Do you have problem with that?

524
00:44:20.794 --> 00:44:23.030
Can't you respect that?

525
00:44:23.063 --> 00:44:24.932
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

526
00:44:24.965 --> 00:44:27.401
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

527
00:44:28.068 --> 00:44:30.738
Are you still there,
Paula?

528
00:44:35.376 --> 00:44:37.745
- Thomas?
- What is it?

529
00:44:37.778 --> 00:44:43.083
I just want to ask you when
you're able to hold the
Captain's Dinner?

530
00:44:43.117 --> 00:44:45.920
Oh, for fuck's sake...

531
00:44:45.953 --> 00:44:49.290
- I can't do the Captain's
Dinner now! - No, I'm asking you
a question, Thomas.

532
00:44:49.323 --> 00:44:53.761
When are you able to put on your
uniform and be there for the
guests?

533
00:44:54.395 --> 00:44:59.934
Oh... Okay.
Well, what's the forecast?

534
00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:03.270
The weather's fine, Thomas.
It's about when you can do it.

535
00:45:04.205 --> 00:45:06.307
Any day but Thursday.

536
00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.476
- Thurs... Thursday's good.
- No. Thomas.

537
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:11.278
- Thursday's bad.
- Huh?

538
00:45:11.312 --> 00:45:14.248
We have a low-pressure zone
moving in. Any day but Thursday.

539
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:17.851
- Yes, Thursday! Okay!
- Okay, Thomas, listen.

540
00:45:17.885 --> 00:45:19.820
I'll come back and talk to you
about this later.

541
00:45:19.853 --> 00:45:23.157
Paula! Every day, they eat
dinner.

542
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:28.062
And they're going to eat dinner
Thursday as well. Right?

543
00:45:28.095 --> 00:45:31.932
Your most expensive champagne,
and three glasses.

544
00:45:31.966 --> 00:45:34.001
- Is this your boyfriends?
- Yeah.

545
00:45:34.902 --> 00:45:38.138
Guys, you take care of these
girls now!

546
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.877
They're really, really nice
girls! Generous. Caring.

547
00:45:43.911 --> 00:45:46.046
You treat them right, you know!

548
00:45:47.047 --> 00:45:49.149
You think they want some
champagne?

549
00:45:49.183 --> 00:45:51.919
Okay, five glasses!
Five glasses.

550
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.895
Ludmilla...

551
00:46:01.929 --> 00:46:04.365
- I love you, baby!
- Yeah, yeah...

552
00:46:07.468 --> 00:46:10.037
Dance with me!

553
00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:13.440
- I'm terrible at dancing.
- What if I go?

554
00:46:14.408 --> 00:46:16.443
- Come on, dance with me!
- No, no...

555
00:46:16.477 --> 00:46:18.479
Come on! Just a little bit.

556
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.916
- No, I'm... I'm so...
- Come on. Don't be shy!

557
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:24.552
- No...
- Why? I'm dancing.

558
00:46:24.586 --> 00:46:28.322
- No... I never dance.
- Come on, dance with me.

559
00:46:28.355 --> 00:46:29.857
- I just don't.
- Why not?

560
00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.993
- I don't like it.
- Okay.

561
00:46:33.027 --> 00:46:36.497
- I feel embarrassed. - Alright,
it's okay. Whatever...

562
00:47:19.306 --> 00:47:20.474
Carl?

563
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:25.412
Carl? Are you jealous?

564
00:47:27.281 --> 00:47:30.250
Hey! Carl?

565
00:47:33.621 --> 00:47:36.457
- Who's Carl?
- What?

566
00:47:40.394 --> 00:47:43.598
- You're not Carl?
- No, no. I'm the pool guy.

567
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:45.332
Ooh...

568
00:47:50.572 --> 00:47:54.308
Sorry about coming into the
mansion, I just needed to get
some tools.

569
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:56.043
Oh?

570
00:48:00.381 --> 00:48:02.316
Over here...

571
00:48:05.352 --> 00:48:08.088
It's very inappropriate.

572
00:48:11.191 --> 00:48:12.660
What if my, er...

573
00:48:14.428 --> 00:48:16.063
...husband comes home?

574
00:48:16.096 --> 00:48:17.431
Where is your husband?

575
00:48:17.464 --> 00:48:21.201
He really shouldn't be leaving
such a beautiful girl on her
own.

576
00:48:21.235 --> 00:48:24.071
Because it's very dangerous
around here.

577
00:48:27.575 --> 00:48:29.943
- He's working.
- Oh...

578
00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:33.180
- Always working...
- Is he?

579
00:48:33.213 --> 00:48:35.717
Yeah.
It's hot, huh?

580
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.185
- Yeah, I'm very hot.
- You should take that off.

581
00:48:38.218 --> 00:48:41.088
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ooh.

582
00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:43.323
Ooh!

583
00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:52.032
The thing is, your husband pays
me a lot of money, you see.

584
00:48:52.065 --> 00:48:57.304
So, I do have to just make sure
I'm doing my job properly.

585
00:48:57.337 --> 00:48:59.541
- Okay?
- You check the pipes.

586
00:48:59.574 --> 00:49:01.408
Yeah, is there any...

587
00:49:02.209 --> 00:49:04.945
...is there any down here
that need to be...

588
00:49:06.346 --> 00:49:10.384
...unblocked, or...
is everything okay?

589
00:49:13.688 --> 00:49:15.757
You're sure you're the right guy
for the job?

590
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.693
I am, I am. I'm very qualified.

591
00:49:18.726 --> 00:49:21.061
Hmm... Let me see.

592
00:49:52.192 --> 00:49:54.729
Do you know what
people regret on their deathbed?

593
00:49:54.762 --> 00:49:56.463
Can you turn the phone?

594
00:49:56.497 --> 00:49:57.732
- No.
- No?

595
00:49:57.765 --> 00:50:01.368
That they were working too much,
seven out of ten people regret

596
00:50:01.401 --> 00:50:05.607
throwing away their lives
on stupid and pointless jobs.

597
00:50:07.074 --> 00:50:11.278
- Can I get you anything to drink?
-  - More champagne, please.

598
00:50:11.311 --> 00:50:15.750
I don't know, I was just born
into this life. It was not my
fault.

599
00:50:15.783 --> 00:50:20.555
And when this happened, I... I
just felt like, "Why? Why?"

600
00:50:20.588 --> 00:50:24.124
- Life is so unfair.
- Yeah.

601
00:50:24.157 --> 00:50:26.628
We are all equal.

602
00:50:26.661 --> 00:50:29.531
- That is so true.
- Everyone's equal.

603
00:50:38.372 --> 00:50:41.676
Is there anything you wish for?

604
00:50:43.143 --> 00:50:47.515
- Sorry? - Is there anything
you... wish for?

605
00:50:48.716 --> 00:50:51.753
Well... Well, I don't know.

606
00:50:53.821 --> 00:50:56.691
That's so sweet of you, madam,
but I'm perfectly fine.

607
00:50:56.724 --> 00:51:01.763
But, but, but, but if today
was your last day alive...

608
00:51:03.263 --> 00:51:07.234
- ...hmm... what would you wish
for? - I have no idea.

609
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:12.574
- Have you been for a swim
today? - No, not today.

610
00:51:13.508 --> 00:51:16.778
Why don't you go for a swim
right now?

611
00:51:19.246 --> 00:51:22.249
Because this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

612
00:51:22.282 --> 00:51:25.720
That's so kind of you, madam,
but unfortunately we're not
allowed

613
00:51:25.753 --> 00:51:28.656
to go for a swim
during working hours, so...

614
00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:31.358
I want all the staff to go for a
swim!

615
00:51:31.391 --> 00:51:34.494
I want you all to go for a swim!

616
00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:39.667
I really feel that I've had
one of these moments.

617
00:51:39.701 --> 00:51:43.771
Yeah, well, today might be
a little bit problematic...

618
00:51:43.805 --> 00:51:45.238
Problematic?

619
00:51:45.272 --> 00:51:46.674
Cos today we have
the Captain's Dinner.

620
00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:51.378
Who cares about the Captain's
Dinner? This will only take half
an hour.

621
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:53.380
Come on, now.

622
00:51:53.413 --> 00:51:55.617
You work too hard, come on.

623
00:51:57.184 --> 00:52:00.555
- Yeah, well, let me see what I
can do. <i>- Merci!</i>

624
00:52:10.732 --> 00:52:14.167
No, no, no! Come back!
Come back, please.

625
00:52:14.201 --> 00:52:17.639
Please come back.
I have a better idea.

626
00:52:18.539 --> 00:52:20.541
- Sit down.
- Okay.

627
00:52:22.209 --> 00:52:24.946
Let's reverse roles.

628
00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:28.348
- Sorry?
- Just change roles.

629
00:52:30.217 --> 00:52:34.488
You... chillax in the jacuzzi,
and I'll get the captain.

630
00:52:34.522 --> 00:52:35.923
Oh... well...

631
00:52:35.957 --> 00:52:39.894
Come on! Just be in the moment,
like I was. Please!

632
00:52:39.927 --> 00:52:42.496
- Yeah, but... - Come, come, I
know you want to.

633
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.732
- Come on!
- Yes, I do but...

634
00:52:44.766 --> 00:52:46.901
But there might be
a problem for me, if I...

635
00:52:46.934 --> 00:52:49.837
Now I have to be the authority.

636
00:52:49.871 --> 00:52:52.640
- Yeah, well, I have my clothes
on... - Shut up, shut up, shut
up!

637
00:52:52.674 --> 00:52:54.341
Shut up! Now!

638
00:52:56.476 --> 00:52:59.947
I command you,
enjoy the moment!

639
00:53:03.316 --> 00:53:05.586
- N-now?
- Please.

640
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.893
- No.
- No?

641
00:53:11.926 --> 00:53:13.861
- No.
- What?

642
00:53:14.929 --> 00:53:16.831
- You say "no" to me?
- No. No!

643
00:53:16.864 --> 00:53:18.599
- So it's "yes"?
- Yes... No.

644
00:53:18.633 --> 00:53:20.968
- "Yes" or "no"?
- I'm saying...

645
00:53:22.369 --> 00:53:24.271
Sorry, I'm saying, n...

646
00:53:24.906 --> 00:53:26.373
I'm saying...

647
00:53:27.407 --> 00:53:30.845
- Yes.
- Yes! Ha-ha!

648
00:53:30.878 --> 00:53:34.015
Don't worry.
Dimitrios will buy the yacht.

649
00:53:34.048 --> 00:53:36.349
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

650
00:53:36.383 --> 00:53:39.453
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Quick, quick, quick... Yes!

651
00:53:45.292 --> 00:53:46.894
- This wonderful Miss...
- Alicia.

652
00:53:58.039 --> 00:54:00.775
Darius? I need your
help.

653
00:54:00.808 --> 00:54:04.879
I need you tell one of the
guests that the crew can't go
for a swim.

654
00:54:04.912 --> 00:54:06.080
Why?

655
00:54:06.114 --> 00:54:08.549
Well, I told them it's not
possible because of the dinner,

656
00:54:08.583 --> 00:54:11.519
but they want to hear it
from the captain in person.

657
00:54:11.552 --> 00:54:14.321
So I went to Thomas' cabin,
I knocked on it, he's not there.

658
00:54:14.354 --> 00:54:16.958
He's not responding.
I can't get a hold of him, so...

659
00:54:16.991 --> 00:54:19.326
Could you just please go and
tell them it's not possible?

660
00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:22.530
- That would be a big help.
- Can't you just go for a swim?

661
00:54:22.563 --> 00:54:24.766
No. I mean,
that would be the easiest,

662
00:54:24.799 --> 00:54:27.735
but they want us to go
from the water slide and...

663
00:54:27.769 --> 00:54:30.905
It's not even funny.
Why are you laughing, Erik?

664
00:54:30.938 --> 00:54:33.440
- Why are you even here?
- I'm on my break.

665
00:54:33.473 --> 00:54:36.043
Well, your break is over.
Go back to work.

666
00:54:36.077 --> 00:54:39.747
It's not even installed yet, it
will take forever, and I don't
have that time.

667
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:42.817
The chef has started the dinner,
I need the prep-time.

668
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.719
So please go and tell them
it's not possible...

669
00:54:44.752 --> 00:54:47.021
I'm not going to go and talk
to some crazy Russians.

670
00:54:47.054 --> 00:54:49.590
It's not crazy Russians,
it's very rich Russians.

671
00:54:49.624 --> 00:54:50.591
Same thing.

672
00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:52.894
Go and solve this problem first,
and then...

673
00:54:52.927 --> 00:54:55.462
No! We're done.

674
00:54:55.495 --> 00:54:59.534
- Why won't you do this?
- Go and take a swim. Jesus...

675
00:54:59.567 --> 00:55:01.368
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

676
00:55:01.401 --> 00:55:04.972
- Can I help you?
- I was just looking.

677
00:55:05.006 --> 00:55:07.340
- You want to see the bridge?
- If possible.

678
00:55:07.374 --> 00:55:11.078
Of course. I can get the First
Officer. He's not doing anything
right now.

679
00:55:12.113 --> 00:55:14.682
- Could you show the guest the
bridge? - Yes, of course.

680
00:55:14.715 --> 00:55:16.584
Welcome to the bridge.

681
00:55:16.617 --> 00:55:19.720
I'm Darius. Nice to meet you.

682
00:55:32.499 --> 00:55:33.835
Thomas?

683
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:39.106
Thomas? Hello?

684
00:55:46.413 --> 00:55:48.783
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

685
00:55:48.816 --> 00:55:53.921
- Actually... I have a question.
- Yes, of course.

686
00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:57.124
Yesterday, I was up on the
sundeck.

687
00:55:57.158 --> 00:56:00.427
And the sun was shining,
everything was perfect.

688
00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.730
But then I looked at the sails.

689
00:56:02.763 --> 00:56:04.699
- The sails?
- Yes.

690
00:56:04.732 --> 00:56:07.434
And they were... a bit dirty.

691
00:56:07.467 --> 00:56:09.737
- Oh!
- Yeah.

692
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:11.639
- Oh...
- Yeah.

693
00:56:18.813 --> 00:56:20.380
Hello?

694
00:56:21.616 --> 00:56:22.617
Hi.

695
00:56:26.486 --> 00:56:30.490
Yeah, but do you realize the
food down here is going to be
bad?

696
00:56:31.993 --> 00:56:33.460
Okay, bye.

697
00:56:34.095 --> 00:56:37.164
Okay, guys, listen up.
You are going to swim.

698
00:56:37.198 --> 00:56:39.967
So, bring your swimming pants,
and go to the main deck

699
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:42.536
as quick as possible, okay?

700
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:46.674
Come on! Chop, chop!
You're going to water slide.

701
00:56:46.707 --> 00:56:48.408
Have fun!

702
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:31.886
Thomas?

703
00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:39.961
Thomas?

704
00:57:43.965 --> 00:57:45.733
'Good afternoon.

705
00:57:45.766 --> 00:57:48.501
'I hope that everyone
has had a great day so far,

706
00:57:48.536 --> 00:57:52.106
'and that you're looking forward
to the Captain's Dinner tonight.

707
00:57:52.139 --> 00:57:56.610
'We would like to inform you
that we have a slight change in
the schedule.

708
00:57:56.644 --> 00:57:59.747
'The Captain's Dinner
will be held at 8:30,

709
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.950
'and not at 8:00,
as it says on the daily program.

710
00:58:02.984 --> 00:58:07.021
'I repeat: the Captain's Dinner
will be held at 8:30.

711
00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:08.222
'Thank you.'

712
00:58:08.255 --> 00:58:10.224
Why the push?

713
00:58:10.257 --> 00:58:13.027
Cos the crew's going
for a... a swim.

714
00:58:13.828 --> 00:58:16.764
- - It's a request from
one of the Russians.

715
00:58:17.665 --> 00:58:22.136
- From the water slide.
- Oh, my God! This I gotta see.

716
00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:24.672
Whoa, whoa!
Do you want to change first?

717
00:58:24.705 --> 00:58:28.275
- Oh, Alessandra! How are you?
- Alicia.

718
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:31.045
- Al...? - Can you leave us for
a bit, please?

719
00:58:31.078 --> 00:58:32.880
Let's go inside, yeah?

720
00:58:32.913 --> 00:58:34.882
I think you need to change
if you wanna go up...

721
00:58:34.915 --> 00:58:36.684
Yeah, yeah...

722
00:58:36.717 --> 00:58:38.619
- Let's go inside and talk.
- No, no...

723
00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.522
Are you okay, man?

724
00:58:42.823 --> 00:58:44.492
- Good.
- Yeah?

725
00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:48.729
- Very good. - We have four and
a half hours left.

726
00:58:48.763 --> 00:58:50.264
Until the Captain's Dinner.

727
00:58:50.297 --> 00:58:54.001
You chill in your room, have
little nap. I'll be back in a
couple of hours.

728
00:58:54.035 --> 00:58:56.203
And we'll... go together.

729
00:58:56.237 --> 00:58:58.239
Yeah?

730
00:59:01.842 --> 00:59:03.677
Darius...

731
00:59:03.711 --> 00:59:05.046
Look at you!

732
00:59:05.079 --> 00:59:10.317
What are you all worked up
about? I'm fine! Just totally
fine.

733
00:59:10.351 --> 00:59:13.921
- Yeah? - Completely, a hundred
percent...

734
00:59:15.156 --> 00:59:17.124
...fine.

735
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:21.629
- Mohammed! Mohammed!
- What?

736
00:59:21.662 --> 00:59:23.597
Come! Let's go! Come, come!

737
00:59:23.631 --> 00:59:26.667
- What?
- Let's go!

738
00:59:28.169 --> 00:59:30.204
Oh! Whoo!

739
00:59:31.972 --> 00:59:33.574
Wonderful!

740
00:59:37.244 --> 00:59:39.647
- Some champagne.
- Bravo!

741
00:59:48.656 --> 00:59:51.859
Are we enjoying ourselves? Yes!

742
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:33.901
If you just stand here,
and they will be coming to you.

743
01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:37.304
- Okay.
- Let me see you. Okay.

744
01:00:39.273 --> 01:00:41.675
- Okay!
- Thank you, Paula.

745
01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:43.978
- Just one night, that's all.
- Okay.

746
01:00:45.146 --> 01:00:48.849
Darius, could you stand next to
him? Just to make sure...

747
01:00:54.255 --> 01:00:56.757
- Okay? You're ready?
- Thank you.

748
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.159
- Yep.
- Yes.

749
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.129
Okay, let's get ready
to open the doors.

750
01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:04.732
Open on my signal, yes?

751
01:01:06.367 --> 01:01:07.968
And... go.

752
01:01:12.507 --> 01:01:14.074
Good evening.

753
01:01:14.108 --> 01:01:16.243
- Welcome to the Captain's
Dinner. - Thank you.

754
01:01:16.277 --> 01:01:19.246
- Would you like a glass of
champagne? - Thank you very
much.

755
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.183
Good evening.
Welcome to the Captain's Dinner.

756
01:01:22.216 --> 01:01:23.884
Hi... Hi!

757
01:01:23.918 --> 01:01:26.754
Good evening. Enjoying your
cruise?

758
01:01:28.088 --> 01:01:30.257
- Welcome.
- Hello, ma'am.

759
01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:32.860
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

760
01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:37.264
Oh, hello, ma'am. How are you?

761
01:01:37.298 --> 01:01:39.266
Enjoy your dinner.

762
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.802
Hope the weather's not
too rough on you.

763
01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:44.972
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

764
01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:46.440
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

765
01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:48.776
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

766
01:01:48.809 --> 01:01:51.178
- Hello, sir. - Good
evening. Jarmo Björkman...

767
01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:53.480
I have a question. I'm sorry.

768
01:01:55.216 --> 01:01:58.152
- Yesterday, I was up on deck.
- Yes.

769
01:01:58.185 --> 01:02:01.889
And it was so beautiful.
Everything was fantastic.

770
01:02:01.922 --> 01:02:04.024
But then, I saw the sails.

771
01:02:04.792 --> 01:02:06.528
The sails?

772
01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:08.262
- The sails, yes.
- Oh...

773
01:02:08.295 --> 01:02:11.899
Yeah. And they were dirt-gray.

774
01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.502
Do you think it's possible
to wash them?

775
01:02:15.537 --> 01:02:19.773
Well, I don't think that's
possible, ma'am, because, er...

776
01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:23.077
- ...this is a motorized vessel.
- Yeah.

777
01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:25.412
So, we don't have any sails.

778
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:31.085
Maybe it was the sundeck roof?

779
01:02:31.118 --> 01:02:35.923
- Well... Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

780
01:02:51.872 --> 01:02:54.108
Yes. He says yes.

781
01:02:54.141 --> 01:02:56.243
- It was sails.
- Magnus says yes.

782
01:02:56.277 --> 01:02:57.411
Yes.

783
01:02:58.479 --> 01:03:00.881
Jesus Christ...

784
01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:03.384
Well, then, in that case,

785
01:03:03.417 --> 01:03:05.853
we will clean the sails.

786
01:03:05.886 --> 01:03:08.956
- Yes.
- Of course.

787
01:03:08.989 --> 01:03:12.459
I'm sure we can find
a solution for you. I'm sure...

788
01:03:12.493 --> 01:03:14.862
- Can I escort you to a table?
- Okay.

789
01:03:14.895 --> 01:03:16.964
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

790
01:03:16.997 --> 01:03:20.267
Well... Jarmo Björkman.
I'm sitting at your table.

791
01:03:20.301 --> 01:03:22.436
- Oh! Good, good.
- Hello, Jarmo.

792
01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:24.271
Are you also sitting
at the captain's table?

793
01:03:24.305 --> 01:03:25.372
Yes, I am.

794
01:03:25.406 --> 01:03:28.075
- Is it this one?
- Yes. Go ahead.

795
01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:29.843
Oh, Lord...

796
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:44.559
It's not so much apps as code.

797
01:03:44.592 --> 01:03:48.996
I create code for apps.
So you can program...

798
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:54.468
So, I sell my codes and my
skills to different tech
companies.

799
01:03:56.136 --> 01:04:01.609
And then, the game makers
are pitching ideas to me.

800
01:04:01.643 --> 01:04:03.444
Sir.

801
01:04:07.915 --> 01:04:09.249
So, good evening.

802
01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:11.485
For tonight's first meal,
we will be serving you

803
01:04:11.519 --> 01:04:14.622
some delicious oysters
with some black Russian caviar.

804
01:04:14.656 --> 01:04:17.525
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

805
01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:27.234
- Are we enjoying the
food? - Yes, very much.

806
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:38.212
So, what business
do you have together?

807
01:04:38.245 --> 01:04:40.447
Oh, it's a family
business.

808
01:04:40.481 --> 01:04:43.585
Producing products
in precision engineering.

809
01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.954
What do you manufacture?

810
01:04:46.987 --> 01:04:50.023
Well, our products have been
employed in upholding democracy

811
01:04:50.057 --> 01:04:52.192
all over the world.

812
01:04:57.998 --> 01:04:59.667
What product is that?

813
01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:03.337
Basically, our best-selling
product is the hand grenade.

814
01:05:05.172 --> 01:05:07.107
Sorry, the what?

815
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:09.309
The hand grenade, dear.

816
01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:18.085
For a long time, it was
the personal exploding device.

817
01:05:18.118 --> 01:05:22.624
But then came those UN
regulations, and messed
everything up.

818
01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:26.093
A personal exploding device...

819
01:05:26.126 --> 01:05:27.595
Excuse me.

820
01:05:27.629 --> 01:05:32.065
...is a very complicated word
for a land mine.

821
01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:34.435
Yeah...

822
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:40.073
Those regulations trimmed...
25% off on profits.

823
01:05:40.107 --> 01:05:42.710
- Yeah. - It was hard times for
us, but...

824
01:05:43.611 --> 01:05:47.448
- We pulled together, didn't we?
- Yes, we did, darling.

825
01:05:47.481 --> 01:05:50.117
And we still love each other.

826
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.019
- A toast!
- Oh, yeah.

827
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.956
Er... to love!

828
01:05:57.257 --> 01:05:58.459
- To love.
- To love.

829
01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:10.370
- Sir.
- Madam.

830
01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:18.713
This is our sea urchin,
with an emulsion of sea weed.

831
01:06:18.746 --> 01:06:22.750
On top, you've got black
truffle, caviar, chili oil,

832
01:06:22.784 --> 01:06:25.553
and a drizzle of yuzu
vinaigrette.

833
01:06:25.587 --> 01:06:27.387
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

834
01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:33.494
- Hmm!
- Hmm...

835
01:06:40.702 --> 01:06:44.037
- Are you enjoying
yourself? - Yes.

836
01:06:44.071 --> 01:06:45.807
Madam.

837
01:07:06.528 --> 01:07:08.128
Sir.

838
01:07:09.129 --> 01:07:10.732
Madam.

839
01:07:12.232 --> 01:07:15.168
- So are you feeling a bit
seasick? - Yes, a bit.

840
01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:17.404
Yes, so I think it would be
better to eat something,

841
01:07:17.437 --> 01:07:20.207
because seasickness is worse
on an empty stomach.

842
01:07:42.864 --> 01:07:44.331
Sir.

843
01:07:52.172 --> 01:07:56.143
So, now we are serving some
hamburger with french fries for
the captain.

844
01:07:56.176 --> 01:07:58.145
And for you, we have
something really special.

845
01:07:58.178 --> 01:08:02.349
We have grilled and smoked
octopus along with some
caramelized lemon,

846
01:08:02.382 --> 01:08:05.687
and on top, beautiful garden
flowers. Please enjoy.

847
01:08:07.154 --> 01:08:09.423
I'm not a fan of fine dining.

848
01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:14.361

Quick!

852
01:08:39.219 --> 01:08:40.822
<i>Santé!</i>

853
01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:45.492
If you feel seasick, you should
try and eat something, ma'am.

854
01:08:45.526 --> 01:08:48.663
Oh, are you okay?

855
01:08:48.696 --> 01:08:52.567
- - Are
you alright, sir?

856
01:08:53.635 --> 01:08:55.737
Sir?

857
01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:09.449
I'm good...

858
01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:14.388
Excuse me.

859
01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:16.557
- Are you okay?
- I'm afraid not...

860
01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:20.728
How are you?

861
01:09:22.563 --> 01:09:25.767
Oh, my God! Oh!

862
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.401
Please.

863
01:09:27.434 --> 01:09:29.637
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

864
01:09:29.671 --> 01:09:32.874
- Oh, my darling.
- More champagne...

865
01:09:33.975 --> 01:09:35.943
Maybe you should have some
water?

866
01:09:35.977 --> 01:09:37.477
Champagne.

867
01:09:37.512 --> 01:09:39.914
Champagne? You should not
drink champagne now.

868
01:09:39.947 --> 01:09:41.849
Take some water, please.

869
01:09:44.585 --> 01:09:47.588
Okay. It's helping. She's fine.
Yeah...

870
01:09:51.559 --> 01:09:55.596
Okay, the restroom.
Let's go, I've got you.

871
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.566
- More wine, sir? -
Ludmilla, don't leave me!

872
01:10:10.812 --> 01:10:12.680
You okay?

873
01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:21.856
Darius?

874
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:27.360
- He doesn't look well. -
You okay? Feeling
seasick, sir?

875
01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:30.297
Is it your chest? Here, chest
pains.

876
01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:32.567
- Grilled octopus...
- Ginger candy?

877
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:36.537
Oh, ma'am.
Thank you for tonight.

878
01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:42.710
Everybody, let's try to keep
calm. Take your seats.

879
01:10:42.744 --> 01:10:45.880
Er... the next course is going
to be wonderful.

880
01:10:45.913 --> 01:10:48.683
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

881
01:10:48.716 --> 01:10:50.718
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

882
01:10:51.619 --> 01:10:53.621
Stay calm, everybody,
everything is fine.

883
01:10:57.759 --> 01:11:01.729
Excuse us. Excuse me.
Make way, please.

884
01:11:01.763 --> 01:11:03.731
Are you okay?

885
01:11:03.765 --> 01:11:06.067
Keep moving, everything is fine.
Everything is fine.

886
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.735
I'm gonna open your shirt.

887
01:11:07.769 --> 01:11:09.570
- Is it a stroke?
- I don't know.

888
01:11:09.604 --> 01:11:10.938
Everybody, stay calm!

889
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.777
Erik! Erik!
The defibrillator right now!

890
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.049
- Careful!
Careful! - Thank you for
tonight.

891
01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:24.552
Thank you for tonight.
Thank you.

892
01:11:24.585 --> 01:11:27.889
- Just clean up now. - Take some
deep breaths for me, sir.

893
01:11:43.905 --> 01:11:45.840
Oh, oh!

894
01:11:45.873 --> 01:11:50.377
- That's okay, madam.
- Hey... There, there.

895
01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:52.880
I'm glad the hat came in useful.

896
01:11:52.914 --> 01:11:56.483
- So sorry, darling...
- No, no. It's nothing at all.

897
01:12:03.825 --> 01:12:06.594
Ha!
Okay, here we are.

898
01:12:07.895 --> 01:12:09.396
Thank you.

899
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:15.770
I have a joke. Do you know
how to tell a communist?

900
01:12:17.171 --> 01:12:20.007
It's someone
who reads Marx and Lenin.

901
01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:23.945
And do you know how to tell
an anti-communist?

902
01:12:23.978 --> 01:12:25.580
Uh-huh.

903
01:12:25.613 --> 01:12:30.417
It's someone who understands
Marx and Lenin. Ha-ha!

904
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:33.486
It's Ronald Reagan.
Funny guy!

905
01:12:33.521 --> 01:12:38.025
"Never argue with an idiot,
they'll only bring you down to
their level

906
01:12:38.059 --> 01:12:41.095
"and beat you with experience."
Mark Twain.

907
01:12:41.128 --> 01:12:43.664
Oh-oh... Okay.

908
01:12:43.698 --> 01:12:46.100
Ronald Reagan, he said also,

909
01:12:46.133 --> 01:12:50.905
"Socialism works only in heaven
where they don't need it,

910
01:12:50.938 --> 01:12:54.976
"and in hell
where they already have it."

911
01:12:55.009 --> 01:12:58.179
- That's... that's
pretty good. - Yeah?

912
01:12:58.212 --> 01:13:00.648
Okay. Hold on... I've got one
here.

913
01:13:01.682 --> 01:13:03.050
Oh, oh, oh, no, I have one!

914
01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:08.556
"Growth for the sake of growth
is the ideology of a cancer
cell."

915
01:13:08.589 --> 01:13:10.658
- Ah...
- That's Edward Abbey.

916
01:13:10.691 --> 01:13:15.428
Listen: "The problem with
socialism is that you eventually

917
01:13:15.462 --> 01:13:18.532
"run out of other people's
money."

918
01:13:18.566 --> 01:13:21.736
- Margaret Thatcher. - You're
going to like this one...

919
01:13:21.769 --> 01:13:26.774
"The last capitalist we hang
will be the one who sold us the
rope."

920
01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:30.410
- Karl Marx.
- Oh! Shit!

921
01:13:30.878 --> 01:13:34.015
Okay! Okay, okay, okay...

922
01:13:38.519 --> 01:13:42.023
- Sorry.
- Dear God!

923
01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:47.528
Okay. A classic.

924
01:13:47.561 --> 01:13:50.898
"The most powerful single force
in the world today

925
01:13:50.932 --> 01:13:55.803
"is man's eternal desire
to be free and independent."

926
01:13:55.836 --> 01:13:58.005
- Kennedy.
- Okay.

927
01:13:58.039 --> 01:14:01.642
"Freedom in capitalist society
always remains about the same

928
01:14:01.676 --> 01:14:03.611
"as it was in ancient Greece.

929
01:14:03.644 --> 01:14:06.547
"Freedom... for slave owners."

930
01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:08.749
I know. Vladimir Lenin!

931
01:14:10.851 --> 01:14:12.186
- School.
- Ah...

932
01:14:15.656 --> 01:14:19.260
A Russian capitalist,
and an American communist.

933
01:14:19.293 --> 01:14:22.964
On a $250-million luxury yacht.

934
01:14:45.119 --> 01:14:46.654
Very good!

935
01:14:47.555 --> 01:14:49.190
Drink, my friend!

936
01:14:49.223 --> 01:14:51.959
Drink, you're supposed to drain
it.

937
01:14:51.993 --> 01:14:54.061
- Come on.
- Okay.

938
01:14:54.095 --> 01:14:55.563
Drink!

939
01:14:56.797 --> 01:15:00.601
- Dimitry, stay focused! Stay
focused. - Okay. Okay, okay.

940
01:15:00.634 --> 01:15:02.269
- Drink!
- Okay.

941
01:15:04.905 --> 01:15:07.074
- Red or black?
- Black.

942
01:15:07.108 --> 01:15:08.542
Very good.

943
01:15:09.276 --> 01:15:12.246
- Red or black?
- Er... black.

944
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.782
Have a drink.

945
01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:21.288
Okay...

946
01:15:23.224 --> 01:15:25.026
- Red or black?
- Black.

947
01:15:25.059 --> 01:15:27.161
Very good!

948
01:15:27.194 --> 01:15:29.296
- Red.
- Take a drink!

949
01:15:30.664 --> 01:15:32.266
Wow...

950
01:15:37.671 --> 01:15:38.839
Red or black?

951
01:15:40.041 --> 01:15:41.976
Er...

952
01:15:47.048 --> 01:15:49.250
- Red.
- Drink, my friend!

953
01:15:50.618 --> 01:15:52.553
You... You haven't got a one!

954
01:16:04.698 --> 01:16:07.168
Shh!

955
01:16:25.352 --> 01:16:27.088
'Shit!

956
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:31.692
'I sell shit.'

957
01:16:31.725 --> 01:16:33.727
I sell shit.

958
01:16:34.695 --> 01:16:35.963
Shit.

959
01:16:49.376 --> 01:16:52.880
The ship is going under.

960
01:16:52.913 --> 01:16:55.015
'The ship is going under!'

961
01:16:58.219 --> 01:17:00.788
'Mayday.'

962
01:17:01.755 --> 01:17:06.360
'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
The ship is going under!

963

Ma'am?
Are you okay, ma'am?

I am not a communist.
I'm a Marxist.

Or actually,
you don't have a choice.

975

Just like in a communist
dictatorship, you have to
listen.

Yes, that is from your resident
Russian capitalist pig.

'I'm not angry with you,
it's like Karl Marx said:

in abundance,

01:20:36.904 --> 01:20:40.307
I... I'm not a worthy socialist.

1013
01:20:42.142 --> 01:20:44.378
I'm a shit shoshialist.

1014
01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.881
- Open the door.
- Hey!

1015
01:20:47.915 --> 01:20:50.150
- Is it locked?
- Yeah.

1016
01:20:50.184 --> 01:20:52.620
- Thomas?
- Open the door.

1017
01:20:55.122 --> 01:20:58.892
- Open the door, Thomas. - I'm
so sorry, that was
irresponsible.

1018
01:20:58.926 --> 01:21:01.596
- Let us talk.
- Where's he going?

1019
01:21:02.963 --> 01:21:06.634
Open the door!
Let us talk. Open the door.

1020
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:09.403
Thomas?

1021
01:22:40.294 --> 01:22:43.598
'We had a discussion,
and it's very important.'

1022
01:22:43.631 --> 01:22:48.035
And it was stupid.
But it was a technical problem.

1023
01:22:48.068 --> 01:22:52.473
- I have scared passengers...
- We didn't know.

1024
01:22:52.507 --> 01:22:57.077
Now you go in your cabin.
Relax, and we have discuss...

1025
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:59.781
- Stop talking!
- Relax, Paula, it was okay.

1026
01:22:59.814 --> 01:23:04.251
Well, thank you for all your
work. I really appreciate it.

1027
01:23:04.284 --> 01:23:07.689
- Thomas! Thomas! Thomas? - You
are great. You are not fired.

1028
01:23:07.722 --> 01:23:13.060
- I am the new owner of the
ship. - Open this door!

1029
01:23:23.905 --> 01:23:29.309
'How people perceive
themselves is nothing that
interests me.

1030
01:23:29.343 --> 01:23:32.246
'There are very few that are
gonna look in the mirror and
say:

1031
01:23:32.279 --> 01:23:35.583
'"The person I see
is a savage monster."'

1032
01:23:35.617 --> 01:23:42.022
Instead, they make up some
construction that justifies what
they do.

1033
01:23:43.525 --> 01:23:45.459
And there it is.

1034
01:23:45.492 --> 01:23:50.197
You're rich, so you're a
philanthropist, so you can cure
your conscience

1035
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.500
for not paying enough in tax.

1036
01:23:53.535 --> 01:23:56.470
'Not contributing enough to
society.'

1037
01:24:02.476 --> 01:24:05.212
Mama! Mama!

1038
01:24:12.754 --> 01:24:15.255
Ow! Shit!

1039
01:24:15.289 --> 01:24:18.325
- Oh, it hit me in the face! Oh,
my God! - I have a flash light.

1040
01:24:18.358 --> 01:24:20.828
- Fuck!
- Was that everything?

1041
01:24:20.862 --> 01:24:22.730
How about...
How about this one?

1042
01:24:22.764 --> 01:24:27.067
- Oh! That... That!
- Ow! Shit! Goddamn it!

1043
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:31.338
I want to read you
something that I wrote.

1044
01:24:32.707 --> 01:24:35.777
- Come over here. Bring the
light. - Okay.

1045
01:24:41.649 --> 01:24:44.552
And I recall, I was seven years
old walking into the kitchen

1046
01:24:44.586 --> 01:24:47.622
to find my mother crying
inconsolably.

1047
01:24:47.655 --> 01:24:50.558
Martin Luther King had been
shot.

1048
01:24:50.592 --> 01:24:54.862
Two months later, she was crying
again. Bobby Kennedy was killed.

1049
01:24:54.896 --> 01:24:58.465
I couldn't know then what I know
now, that the invisible thread

1050
01:24:58.498 --> 01:25:02.570
connecting Martin Luther King,
the Kennedy brothers, and
Malcolm X,

1051
01:25:02.604 --> 01:25:07.240
was that in each case, my
government had their finger on
the trigger.

1052
01:25:07.274 --> 01:25:09.309
- Wait. Wait!
- But every...

1053
01:25:16.884 --> 01:25:18.886
Say it again.

1054
01:25:20.955 --> 01:25:25.927
My government murdered
Martin Luther King, Malcolm X,

1055
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.363
Bobby Kennedy,
and John F. Kennedy.

1056

War itself became
our most lucrative industry.

Every bomb that's dropped,
somebody makes a million
dollars.

You don't have to know
where those bombs are exploding.

- Yeah.

In T-shirt and shorts?

1090
01:29:11.018 --> 01:29:14.856
No, no, it's because, er...
I was off duty.

1091
01:29:16.724 --> 01:29:19.060
I was sleeping, and then...

1092
01:29:19.093 --> 01:29:21.729
- You were off duty, yeah?
- Yeah.

1093
01:29:22.864 --> 01:29:26.466
- Is there a problem?
- Strange, I've never seen you.

1094
01:29:26.499 --> 01:29:28.736
- Stay calm.
- I work in the engine room.

1095
01:29:28.769 --> 01:29:31.005
- In engine room?
- Yeah, yeah.

1096
01:29:31.038 --> 01:29:33.674
I'm sorry, I've never seen you
before.

1097
01:29:33.708 --> 01:29:36.476
- He works in the engine room? -
It doesn't matter where he
works.

1098
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:40.480
Settle down now.
Stay calm in this situation.

1099
01:29:40.514 --> 01:29:43.017
I'm calm, I'm calm. What's the
problem with you, man?

1100
01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:44.886
No one else?

1101
01:29:44.919 --> 01:29:46.687
You think I'm a pirate?

1102
01:29:46.721 --> 01:29:48.055
Are you okay?

1103
01:29:48.089 --> 01:29:51.726
Just because I'm black, you
think that I'm a pirate. That's
it!

1104
01:29:51.759 --> 01:29:53.828
- Ah! Okay, okay.
- Don't go there...

1105
01:29:53.861 --> 01:29:56.463
- Don't say that
I'm... - Don't go there.

1106
01:29:56.496 --> 01:29:58.566
You can cry on my
shoulder!

1107
01:29:58.599 --> 01:30:02.570
He comes to me with his big
watch and says I'm a pirate just
because I'm black!

1108
01:30:02.603 --> 01:30:03.704
What's the problem with you,
man?

1109
01:30:03.738 --> 01:30:06.073
He hasn't said anything
about you being black.

1110
01:30:06.107 --> 01:30:10.945
- You're calling him a racist. -
In the eyes, I can see it in his
eyes...

1111
01:30:10.978 --> 01:30:13.514
- Who are you? Who are
you? - Sir!

1112
01:30:13.547 --> 01:30:16.751
- I work in the engine room,
man! - Sir!

1113
01:30:16.784 --> 01:30:18.853
- What?
- Excuse me.

1114
01:30:18.886 --> 01:30:21.088
I think you should just calm
down now.

1115
01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:23.791
It's not a good time
to step up the situation.

1116
01:30:23.824 --> 01:30:26.827
- Just stay calm and stay positive.
-  - He works in the engine room?

1117
01:30:26.861 --> 01:30:30.564
There's a lot of people on the boat.
 We can't see each other all the time.

1118
01:30:30.598 --> 01:30:34.669
- So what's the problem?
- Please don't go there.

1119
01:30:34.702 --> 01:30:36.570
I'm sorry. I just have to get
that.

1120
01:30:37.972 --> 01:30:40.875
- Just say what you have
to say. - Stop.

1121
01:30:40.908 --> 01:30:42.677
Say it to me.

1122
01:30:42.710 --> 01:30:44.979
Yes, I know.
I'll get back to you. I know.

1123
01:30:45.012 --> 01:30:47.648
Sir. Sir!

1124
01:31:32.259 --> 01:31:34.762
Oh! Ah!

1125
01:31:34.795 --> 01:31:35.930
Easy, easy!

1126
01:31:50.745 --> 01:31:51.979
Oh...

1127
01:31:52.013 --> 01:31:54.982
- Ow! Ow!
- Shh, shh!

1128
01:31:57.685 --> 01:31:59.553
Be quiet.

1129
01:32:13.334 --> 01:32:16.170
No, don't use the
flares!

1130
01:32:16.203 --> 01:32:19.140
It's our last flare!
Don't use the flare!

1131
01:33:45.025 --> 01:33:47.895
- Hey!
- What?

1132
01:33:47.928 --> 01:33:49.330
Look!

1133
01:33:49.363 --> 01:33:51.031
Oh, shit...

1134
01:33:52.299 --> 01:33:54.401
Yaya, wake up, wake up.

1135
01:33:58.305 --> 01:33:59.773
Look!

1136
01:34:12.153 --> 01:34:14.321
There's water in there.

1137
01:34:14.355 --> 01:34:16.757
- There's water in there.
- Yes!

1138
01:34:17.858 --> 01:34:19.994
- Is it closed?
- It's closed. It's closed.

1139
01:34:20.027 --> 01:34:23.330
- Paula, we need
water! - Be patient.

1140
01:34:23.364 --> 01:34:27.034
- Is somebody in there? - Yeah,
there's someone in there.

1141
01:34:27.067 --> 01:34:29.136
Calm down, calm down.

1142
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:31.238
- Does she have water?
- Yes.

1143
01:34:31.272 --> 01:34:35.709
Open up! Open up!

1144
01:34:35.743 --> 01:34:39.980
Open up!
Open up! Open up!

1145
01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:44.852
- It's Abigail. Abigail!
Come out! - Ma'am Paula?

1146
01:34:44.885 --> 01:34:47.121
- Are you okay?
- What?

1147
01:34:47.154 --> 01:34:49.056
- Open the hatch!
- Water! Water!

1148
01:34:49.089 --> 01:34:51.358
- Okay! - Paula, we
need water...

1149
01:34:53.894 --> 01:34:56.864
- Hey, ma'am Paula!
- What do you have?

1150
01:34:57.298 --> 01:35:00.201
We need all of these boxes out.
Okay?

1151
01:35:00.234 --> 01:35:03.170
So, everybody, just calm down.
We'll get water now.

1152
01:35:03.204 --> 01:35:04.705
Yes!

1153
01:35:04.738 --> 01:35:07.374
There's some chips in there as well.
 So, everybody will get some.

1154
01:35:07.408 --> 01:35:09.343
- And chips?
- And chips.

1155
01:35:16.183 --> 01:35:18.852
What's she doing?

1156
01:35:18.886 --> 01:35:21.755
What are you doing?
What's taking so long? Come on.

1157
01:35:24.491 --> 01:35:27.795
Just wait a minute. Just back
up. Back up a bit.

1158
01:35:28.563 --> 01:35:31.365
And the chips, Abigail.
Come on, everything out.

1159
01:35:31.398 --> 01:35:34.101
Paula, ask for food,
yeah?

1160
01:35:37.238 --> 01:35:39.807
- And the Evian.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1161
01:35:42.142 --> 01:35:44.345
Thank you.
And how many are you?

1162
01:35:44.378 --> 01:35:47.982
You're five? Just be patient.
Everyone will get...

1163
01:35:48.949 --> 01:35:50.284
Here you go.

1164
01:35:51.919 --> 01:35:53.287
There you go.

1165
01:35:54.321 --> 01:35:55.956
Please save it.

1166
01:36:05.499 --> 01:36:08.936
- Are there more boxes with water?
-  - No, this is it.

1167
01:36:08.969 --> 01:36:11.138
- What's this?
- It's a facial spray.

1168
01:36:11.171 --> 01:36:13.907
But you can drink it,
it's just water in a can.

1169
01:36:15.009 --> 01:36:18.212
Keep it close to your mouth,
so you won't waste it.

1170
01:36:22.584 --> 01:36:24.118
Here you go.

1171
01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:50.944
Okay?

1172
01:37:28.048 --> 01:37:31.151
Bravo!

1173
01:37:31.185 --> 01:37:34.088
- Bravo!
- Whoo!

1174
01:37:35.657 --> 01:37:37.157
Crazy.

1175
01:37:41.929 --> 01:37:46.266
- Did she catch that with her hands?
-  - Good job, Abigail!

1176
01:37:47.702 --> 01:37:51.639
Good job! What is that? An
octopus?

1177
01:37:51.673 --> 01:37:54.007
- Octopus.
- Good!

1178
01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:57.111
- What do you think we should do
now? - Fucking impressive.

1179
01:37:57.144 --> 01:38:02.116
- We need to make a fire.
-  - Of course we need to make a fire.

1180
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:03.384
Yes...

1181
01:38:05.152 --> 01:38:08.088
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1182
01:38:08.122 --> 01:38:09.289
What?

1183
01:38:09.323 --> 01:38:13.193
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1184
01:38:16.296 --> 01:38:17.898
- No?
- No!

1185
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.401
- What?
- No!

1186
01:38:21.902 --> 01:38:25.172
Then you'll make the fire after
you're done fishing, and then we
should...

1187
01:38:25.205 --> 01:38:28.409
- We need to clean the
octopus. - Of course we do.

1188
01:38:32.514 --> 01:38:36.150
Do any of you know
how to clean an octopus?

1189
01:38:36.183 --> 01:38:40.387
- Huh?
- To clean an octopus!

1190
01:38:40.421 --> 01:38:42.423
Do you know how to do it?

1191
01:38:51.098 --> 01:38:53.133
Uh-huh...

1192
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:05.145
One for you.

1193
01:39:06.146 --> 01:39:08.048
One for me.

1194
01:39:08.081 --> 01:39:09.416
One for you.

1195
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:12.152
One for me.

1196
01:39:12.186 --> 01:39:14.054
One for you.

1197
01:39:14.087 --> 01:39:15.757
One for me.

1198
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:17.592
One for you.

1199
01:39:17.625 --> 01:39:19.159
One for me.

1200
01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:21.128
One for you.

1201
01:39:21.729 --> 01:39:23.565
One for me.

1202
01:39:23.598 --> 01:39:27.034
One for you. One for me.

1203
01:39:27.434 --> 01:39:29.403
One for you.

1204
01:39:29.436 --> 01:39:31.104
For me.

1205
01:39:31.138 --> 01:39:33.140
For you. For me.

1206
01:39:33.173 --> 01:39:35.610
For you.
For me.

1207
01:39:37.211 --> 01:39:39.413
- Uh-huh!
- What?

1208
01:39:41.816 --> 01:39:43.551
What's that?

1209
01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.454
That's mine.

1210
01:39:47.488 --> 01:39:49.557
No, the big pile there?
What's that?

1211
01:39:49.591 --> 01:39:52.092
Mine. It's mine.

1212
01:39:52.125 --> 01:39:55.095
- All of this?
- Yes.

1213
01:39:56.096 --> 01:40:00.067
No. No, no, no...
Why do you get so much food?

1214
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:03.036
Why?

1215
01:40:06.808 --> 01:40:08.710
I caught the fish.

1216
01:40:09.511 --> 01:40:11.646
- Yes?
- I made the fire.

1217
01:40:11.679 --> 01:40:13.581
- And?
- I cooked.

1218
01:40:13.615 --> 01:40:17.652
I did all the work.
And everybody got something.

1219
01:40:20.688 --> 01:40:22.155
Hmm...

1220
01:40:22.857 --> 01:40:26.260
No. No, we all... we all worked.

1221
01:40:26.293 --> 01:40:28.395
What did you do?

1222
01:40:29.396 --> 01:40:33.100
We... gathered all the wood
for the fire.

1223
01:40:33.133 --> 01:40:35.603
I moved the log.

1224
01:40:35.637 --> 01:40:39.273
Yeah, this big log was over
there, and we moved it over
here.

1225
01:40:39.306 --> 01:40:40.808
Not enough.

1226
01:40:42.175 --> 01:40:45.345
No, maybe not enough,
but we need to work together.

1227
01:40:45.379 --> 01:40:49.449
- They don't know how to do
that. - Exactly.

1228
01:40:51.351 --> 01:40:55.355
And maybe that's why you should
not be so lazy and dependent on
me.

1229
01:40:55.389 --> 01:40:58.158
Uh-huh!

1230
01:41:17.210 --> 01:41:20.682
Abigail...
I think you're forgetting

1231
01:41:20.715 --> 01:41:24.484
that you and I are employees
of a big shipping company.

1232
01:41:24.519 --> 01:41:26.420
Remember?

1233
01:41:26.453 --> 01:41:29.891
In the end, I'm responsible
for the safety of the guests.

1234
01:41:29.924 --> 01:41:31.859
You have to do what I say.

1235
01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.698
We work on a yacht.
You are a toilet manager.

1236
01:41:36.731 --> 01:41:39.601
- You don't know how to
handle... - What yacht?

1237
01:41:39.634 --> 01:41:41.703
Where's the yacht?

1238
01:41:41.736 --> 01:41:44.772
You know this, Abigail,
I am a very rich man.

1239
01:41:44.806 --> 01:41:48.509
When we get back,
I can do good things for you.

1240
01:41:48.543 --> 01:41:50.878
I can make your life easy and
nice.

1241
01:41:50.912 --> 01:41:53.480
- When we get back?
- Yeah.

1242
01:41:53.514 --> 01:41:55.750
When we get back.
People are looking for us.

1243
01:41:55.783 --> 01:41:58.853
What, you think that
we'll stay here forever? What?

1244
01:41:58.886 --> 01:42:01.656
You're funny.

1245
01:42:01.689 --> 01:42:05.192
This is not how you were
trained, Abigail. Please give...

1246
01:42:05.225 --> 01:42:07.260
Whoa!

1247
01:42:09.496 --> 01:42:11.866
Come on, this is
ridiculous.

1248
01:42:13.601 --> 01:42:16.771
You're scaring people.
Put the stick down.

1249
01:42:18.205 --> 01:42:19.574
Hey!

1250
01:42:24.746 --> 01:42:26.446
Who am I?

1251
01:42:27.782 --> 01:42:30.384
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1252
01:42:30.417 --> 01:42:34.589
- You're the toilet manager.
- No.

1253
01:42:34.622 --> 01:42:39.292
On the yacht, toilet manager.
Here... captain. Who am I?

1254
01:42:43.463 --> 01:42:45.465
You're the captain.

1255
01:42:47.267 --> 01:42:48.402
Yes.

1256
01:42:51.438 --> 01:42:53.941
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1257
01:42:53.975 --> 01:42:57.210
- Very good. Cutie
pie? - Captain.

1258
01:42:57.912 --> 01:43:00.480
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1259
01:43:00.515 --> 01:43:02.382
- Who am I?
- The captain.

1260
01:43:03.283 --> 01:43:05.385
Who am I?

1261
01:43:09.356 --> 01:43:10.591
Who am I?

1262
01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.461
Who am I?

1263
01:43:23.805 --> 01:43:26.808
In the yacht, cleaning lady.
Here, captain.

1264
01:43:27.775 --> 01:43:29.309
Okay?

1265
01:43:43.524 --> 01:43:45.560
Have one more.

1266
01:43:45.593 --> 01:43:46.928
Thank you.

1267
01:43:48.029 --> 01:43:50.297
I would say, I agree.

1268
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:53.968
I mean, er...
we have to work together.

1269
01:43:55.036 --> 01:43:58.606
And... create a good group.

1270
01:43:58.639 --> 01:44:00.307
Good society.

1271
01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:02.810
Do you know the saying,

1272
01:44:02.844 --> 01:44:06.313
"From each according to his
ability,

1273
01:44:06.346 --> 01:44:09.249
"to each according to his
needs"?

1274
01:44:12.053 --> 01:44:14.354
You don't know this?

1275
01:44:15.523 --> 01:44:17.024
Ma'am Paula...

1276
01:44:19.994 --> 01:44:25.533
With respect to your expertise
in this situation...

1277
01:44:27.068 --> 01:44:30.838
...I would like to make a
suggestion, if that's okay?

1278
01:44:32.372 --> 01:44:33.708
Sure.

1279
01:44:36.376 --> 01:44:39.379
My suggestion is that
the boys...

1280
01:44:40.681 --> 01:44:45.586
stay here and watch the fire,
and take care of madame.

1281
01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:51.291
While you, ma'am Paula, and you
sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1282
01:45:18.451 --> 01:45:19.720
Thank you.

1283
01:45:26.761 --> 01:45:28.996
Hey, Abigail, look
this...

1284
01:45:29.997 --> 01:45:32.465
I would give you
my Patek Philippe.

1285
01:45:32.499 --> 01:45:34.869
For one night in the
boat. Hey, Abigail...

1286
01:45:34.902 --> 01:45:37.470
150 thousand euros!

1287
01:45:38.639 --> 01:45:42.543
- Let us in. -
For you... original Rolex.

1288
01:45:49.482 --> 01:45:52.887
Nelson... she left the bag.

1289
01:45:53.855 --> 01:45:56.090
- What?
- She left the bag.

1290
01:45:59.492 --> 01:46:01.696
What's in it?

1291
01:46:12.439 --> 01:46:14.575
Pretzel sticks.

1292
01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.450
- No, we can't have it. - I'm
just gonna have a look. Alright?

1293
01:46:29.156 --> 01:46:32.492
- Nice!
- We can't. No.

1294
01:46:40.534 --> 01:46:42.103
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

1295
01:46:42.136 --> 01:46:43.704
Wait, wait, wait...

1296
01:46:50.511 --> 01:46:51.846
Maybe...

1297
01:46:54.815 --> 01:46:57.585
...if we just make a little hole
here...

1298
01:46:58.485 --> 01:47:03.758
Take two out. One each.
They'll never notice it.

1299
01:47:03.791 --> 01:47:05.726
Okay, let me try.

1300
01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:11.732
- Stop it, stop it, stop it...
- Now?

1301
01:47:24.512 --> 01:47:26.547
That was perfect!

1302
01:47:28.916 --> 01:47:32.019
- I don't wanna eat it! I wanna
save it! - So good!

1303
01:47:34.055 --> 01:47:35.856
Put it back.

1304
01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.175
Hmm...

1305
01:48:00.715 --> 01:48:02.950
- Shall we just have one more?
- Yeah.

1306
01:48:02.984 --> 01:48:04.151
Yeah!

1307
01:48:16.063 --> 01:48:17.598
Vera!

1308
01:49:22.196 --> 01:49:24.665
So, what happened here?

1309
01:49:24.698 --> 01:49:27.301
Er... we made a mistake with...

1310
01:49:29.036 --> 01:49:31.005
Why?

1311
01:49:31.038 --> 01:49:33.140
We just fell asleep.

1312
01:49:33.174 --> 01:49:37.611
Now I won't have enough time to
go fish, because I have to make
another fire.

1313
01:49:38.946 --> 01:49:41.916
It takes a lot of work
to make a fire, you know.

1314
01:49:41.949 --> 01:49:43.751
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1315
01:50:00.167 --> 01:50:01.902
Okay.

1316
01:50:03.838 --> 01:50:07.074
Okay. Okay, okay.
Let's get this day started.

1317
01:50:07.108 --> 01:50:09.210
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1318
01:50:11.078 --> 01:50:12.847
- Okay.
- Cool.

1319
01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:15.883
Wait, wait, wait.
There's one more thing.

1320
01:50:17.685 --> 01:50:21.889
Because, last night,
we left our backpack here,

1321
01:50:21.922 --> 01:50:25.159
and, well,
we're not very sure, but...

1322
01:50:25.192 --> 01:50:28.762
...we think we're missing
a pack of pretzel sticks.

1323
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:32.333
- You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

1324
01:50:32.366 --> 01:50:33.901
No.

1325
01:50:36.170 --> 01:50:38.305
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1326
01:50:38.339 --> 01:50:41.909
- Why are we being accused?
- Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1327
01:50:41.942 --> 01:50:44.078
I'm just making sure, because...

1328
01:50:50.451 --> 01:50:51.886
What's this?

1329
01:50:53.954 --> 01:50:55.789
- Well, we didn't...
- You didn't?

1330
01:50:55.823 --> 01:50:56.924
- No.
- No, we didn't.

1331
01:50:56.957 --> 01:51:00.027
- And you're sure you didn't?
- We are sure we didn't.

1332
01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.929
- Very sure?
- Yes.

1333
01:51:05.166 --> 01:51:08.836
- I think they need to be
punished. - Yes, ma'am Paula.

1334
01:51:11.772 --> 01:51:14.074
This is really bad.

1335
01:51:14.108 --> 01:51:16.377
This is really, really bad.

1336
01:51:17.444 --> 01:51:19.380
Oh, come on...

1337
01:51:19.413 --> 01:51:21.715
I mean, you didn't watch the
fire.

1338
01:51:21.749 --> 01:51:24.118
And then you steal
a pack of pretzel sticks?

1339
01:51:24.151 --> 01:51:27.021
- Yeah, and lie about it.
- We deserved it.

1340
01:51:27.054 --> 01:51:30.090
And not just to me,
to everybody here.

1341
01:51:31.992 --> 01:51:34.161
How can we trust you,
after what you did?

1342
01:51:34.195 --> 01:51:36.730
I need to say something now,
because this is becoming
ridiculous.

1343
01:51:36.764 --> 01:51:41.035
- No, let me say something, Abigail.
-  - Did you see that?

1344
01:51:41.068 --> 01:51:42.903
What?

1345
01:51:42.937 --> 01:51:45.973
Don't point at her.
Put your hands down.

1346
01:51:47.308 --> 01:51:50.911
- Okay, alright, Just let me say, though...
-  - Put your hands down!

1347
01:51:51.478 --> 01:51:53.047
What?

1348
01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:55.950
Your body language
is so aggressive, Carl!

1349
01:51:55.983 --> 01:51:59.086
- What? - I'm not
getting any food for you.

1350
01:51:59.119 --> 01:52:02.790
- You find your own food.
- What? Come on, man...

1351
01:52:02.823 --> 01:52:06.126
- No, Abigail, that's so unfair!
- Put your hands down.

1352
01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:09.430
You seriously don't get it.
Put your hands down!

1353
01:52:09.463 --> 01:52:13.234
- I'm trying to defend myself.
- Don't defend yourself!

1354
01:52:13.267 --> 01:52:17.204
You are inflicting pain on her
by defending yourself.

1355
01:52:35.155 --> 01:52:37.858
Shut the fuck up! No...

1356
01:52:40.261 --> 01:52:41.795
No!

1357
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:11.526
Hey! Ha-ha!

1358
01:53:12.993 --> 01:53:15.896
Oh... hey.

1359
01:53:16.897 --> 01:53:19.833
- What a nice fish, huh?
- Yes.

1360
01:53:19.867 --> 01:53:21.935
- Wow!
- We have a lot.

1361
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:25.372
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1362
01:53:27.207 --> 01:53:30.811
- Where did you get it? - There,
at the back of the rock.

1363
01:53:32.112 --> 01:53:34.915
- You're good at that.
- Thank you.

1364
01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.120
You need help?

1365
01:53:40.154 --> 01:53:43.357
Yeah, sure, get some Nutella.

1366
01:54:05.613 --> 01:54:07.481
Oh, thank you!

1367
01:55:27.327 --> 01:55:29.196
What?

1368
01:55:40.608 --> 01:55:44.211
- Yaya? Wait, wait!
- Dickhead! Piss off!

1369
01:56:06.066 --> 01:56:09.336
Okay, I'm going
to the lifeboat now.

1370
01:56:09.369 --> 01:56:12.439
Ma'am Paula, can you stay here
and watch the fire?

1371
01:56:12.473 --> 01:56:14.007
Sure.

1372
01:56:16.744 --> 01:56:21.583
And since Carl didn't eat
anything today, he can sleep
with me in the lifeboat.

1373
01:56:23.685 --> 01:56:25.285
Okay. Yeah.

1374
01:56:30.758 --> 01:56:34.662
- Can I come? -
Abigail, can we both come or...?

1375
01:56:34.696 --> 01:56:37.097
No, just you.

1376
01:56:40.267 --> 01:56:44.071
- Fine, I'll take the
pretzels! - Eh?

1377
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:50.444
You're making this into an
issue.

1378
01:56:50.477 --> 01:56:52.647
Are you going to take them?
Yes, take them. Good.

1379
01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:56.083
- Why are you making this into
an issue? -

1380
01:56:56.116 --> 01:56:58.185
I'm coming! One second!

1381
01:57:04.324 --> 01:57:08.061
- What are you gonna do on the
boat? - I don't know.

1382
01:57:09.697 --> 01:57:11.064
Don't act naive, seriously!

1383
01:57:11.098 --> 01:57:13.668
I don't know why she asked me,
but I'm gonna do it, of
course...

1384
01:57:13.701 --> 01:57:15.302
- Really?
- Yes.

1385
01:57:15.335 --> 01:57:17.739
What do you think she wants with
you?

1386
01:57:17.772 --> 01:57:20.508
You're a young, hot guy. What do
you think she's going to do with
you?

1387
01:57:22.242 --> 01:57:24.512
- Okay, then give them back...
- No. No!

1388
01:57:24.546 --> 01:57:27.515
- Let me take them back.
- No. And they're mine, okay?

1389
01:57:27.549 --> 01:57:30.183
Take a few, and I'll take them
back, cos I don't wanna do this.

1390
01:57:30.217 --> 01:57:31.686
- It's not a good idea.
- I want these!

1391
01:57:31.719 --> 01:57:36.524
You need to tell me what to do!
You need to tell me how to
navigate this.

1392
01:57:42.329 --> 01:57:43.598
Yaya?

1393
01:57:47.434 --> 01:57:50.103
You just have to stroke her ego.

1394
01:57:53.206 --> 01:57:56.511
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1395
01:57:56.544 --> 01:57:58.846
- And... and smile.
- Mm-hmm...

1396
01:58:00.213 --> 01:58:01.481
Okay.

1397
01:58:01.516 --> 01:58:04.451
- Make sure to set up
boundaries. - Yeah.

1398
01:58:04.484 --> 01:58:08.388
- And nothing sexual, okay? -
No, I won't do anything sexual.

1399
01:58:08.923 --> 01:58:09.991
Mm-hmm...

1400
01:58:10.024 --> 01:58:12.259
And don't do anything
you wouldn't want me to do.

1401
01:58:12.292 --> 01:58:14.461
No, I won't do anything
you're not comfortable with.

1402
01:58:14.494 --> 01:58:17.431
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1403
01:58:21.703 --> 01:58:23.771
Yaya, I think she's probably
expecting something.

1404
01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:28.710
- Like what?
- I don't know... I, er...

1405
01:58:29.911 --> 01:58:31.311
- A massage, or...
- A massage?

1406
01:58:31.345 --> 01:58:34.782
- I don't know. She might want
something. - Definitely not a
massage!

1407
01:58:34.816 --> 01:58:37.384
She just gave me a whole fucking
packet of pretzels for you...

1408
01:58:37.417 --> 01:58:39.754
I don't know what to say...
I can't do anything?

1409
01:58:39.787 --> 01:58:41.556
- No!
- Okay, but...

1410
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:44.458
- Massage her neck. Okay?
- I can massage her neck?

1411
01:58:44.491 --> 01:58:46.794
- Her neck, that's it!
- Okay, okay, okay...

1412
01:58:49.329 --> 01:58:50.898
Okay.

1413
01:58:53.233 --> 01:58:55.570
- I love you so much.
- Well, I hate you.

1414
01:58:55.603 --> 01:58:57.905
I understand! Fuck...

1415
01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:01.408
Yeah... Coming!

1416
01:59:19.359 --> 01:59:21.361
- See you in a bit.
- Morning.

1417
01:59:22.429 --> 01:59:24.699
- Oh, morning.
- Asshole.

1418
01:59:26.333 --> 01:59:28.936
Yaya!
Yaya, wait. Wait.

1419
01:59:36.276 --> 01:59:38.946
Hey, you!

1420
02:00:12.312 --> 02:00:14.549
- See you later.
- Okay.

1421
02:00:14.582 --> 02:00:17.952
Pirate! Pirate! He's
coming! He got caught!

1422
02:00:22.957 --> 02:00:24.726
Disgusting.

1423
02:00:24.759 --> 02:00:26.728
What?

1424
02:00:38.505 --> 02:00:40.541
What the fuck?

1425
02:00:41.642 --> 02:00:43.611
Oh, fucking hell...

1426
02:01:01.428 --> 02:01:04.331
- Pretty boy!
- We can see you!

1427
02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:18.913
Have you ever used your...
when you were young?

1428
02:01:21.816 --> 02:01:24.018
Oh, you slept with somebody
to get a job?

1429
02:01:35.395 --> 02:01:37.397
No, you didn't?

1430
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:39.967
Really? Once?

1431
02:01:45.472 --> 02:01:48.042
Therese... Wow!

1432
02:01:53.114 --> 02:01:55.448
Where is it?

1433
02:01:55.482 --> 02:01:58.619
- Give it to me!
- Take it! Take it.

1434
02:02:01.856 --> 02:02:04.792
You're acting like children.
Give me the whistle!

1435
02:02:04.826 --> 02:02:06.828
Give me the whistle now!

1436
02:02:09.564 --> 02:02:11.364
So childish!

1437
02:02:41.095 --> 02:02:42.763
Hey...

1438
02:02:42.797 --> 02:02:45.432
- Pirate? What was it?
- Did you see it?

1439
02:02:45.465 --> 02:02:47.668
- What was it?
- I don't know what it is.

1440
02:02:51.739 --> 02:02:55.375
- What's going on?
- They're hunting something.

1441
02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:03.851
No. We don't go there.
What?

1442
02:03:03.885 --> 02:03:05.953
- Come on, guys!
- Shh!

1443
02:03:12.693 --> 02:03:14.795
Nelson, give me that.

1444
02:03:16.797 --> 02:03:19.000
Are you sure?

1445
02:03:36.918 --> 02:03:38.451
Fuck...

1446
02:03:45.092 --> 02:03:46.894
It's a female.

1447
02:03:48.029 --> 02:03:49.664
Kill it.

1448
02:04:06.881 --> 02:04:09.183
- Whoo!
- Ya!

1449
02:04:14.922 --> 02:04:17.825
It's moving. It's moving.

1450
02:04:17.858 --> 02:04:20.628
- What?
- It's not dead. It's not dead.

1451
02:04:20.661 --> 02:04:23.798
- It's moving.
- It's not dead.

1452
02:04:26.901 --> 02:04:28.970
- What's he doing?
- No, no, no.

1453
02:04:30.638 --> 02:04:32.606
Ah, again! Do it again!

1454
02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:46.654
Jarmo! Jarmo... <i>la tempe.</i>

1455
02:04:54.628 --> 02:04:56.564
Hey, you did it!

1456
02:05:06.841 --> 02:05:11.712
Hunter Jarmo! Big hunter! Come
on!

1457
02:05:11.746 --> 02:05:16.217
- Give him applause! Hey! - Jarmo! Jarmo! Jarmo...

1458
02:05:18.652 --> 02:05:22.590
- Big donkey hunt!
- Come on, speech!

1459
02:05:22.623 --> 02:05:25.893
- Okay, okay!
- The donkey fairytale...

1460
02:05:25.926 --> 02:05:28.896
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Thank you very much.

1461
02:05:28.929 --> 02:05:34.869
Okay... To kill a donkey,
it may be a great achievement.

1462
02:05:34.902 --> 02:05:37.905
But there's one thing
that's so much greater.

1463
02:05:37.938 --> 02:05:41.242
- To paint!
- To paint, yes!

1464
02:05:42.043 --> 02:05:45.079
To paint a donkey!

1465
02:05:45.112 --> 02:05:47.915
Yes!

1466
02:05:51.118 --> 02:05:53.254
Let's take a look
at the expression.

1467
02:05:53.287 --> 02:05:55.923
- Who did this one?
- Me.

1468
02:05:55.956 --> 02:05:59.226
Okay, the feet are close, close
together.

1469
02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:02.763
This donkey wants to be in
control.

1470
02:06:02.797 --> 02:06:06.100
But it looks almost scared.

1471
02:06:07.001 --> 02:06:09.203
You want to tell this donkey
to...

1472
02:06:10.271 --> 02:06:12.139
...to not be so scared.

1473
02:06:12.173 --> 02:06:17.178
To lose control and bound away
across the fields,

1474
02:06:17.211 --> 02:06:20.081
wildly waving its tail!

1475
02:06:21.148 --> 02:06:24.685
- Sure, it will make mistakes...
- Carl, what are you doing?

1476
02:06:28.656 --> 02:06:29.824
Huh?

1477
02:06:31.258 --> 02:06:33.294
- Carl?
- Yeah.

1478
02:06:35.996 --> 02:06:38.165
What are you doing with your
hand?

1479
02:06:41.001 --> 02:06:43.971
- Which one?
- Seriously?

1480
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:50.878
I'm just resting it on the
chair.

1481
02:06:53.047 --> 02:06:56.217
Why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair?

1482
02:06:58.018 --> 02:06:59.386
What...?

1483
02:07:00.421 --> 02:07:02.790
It was just...
I don't know, it was there,

1484
02:07:02.823 --> 02:07:05.392
resting on the side of... the
chair.

1485
02:07:28.482 --> 02:07:31.652
I'm coming.
I'm coming!

1486
02:07:32.987 --> 02:07:34.722
I'm coming...

1487
02:07:34.755 --> 02:07:37.324
- Oh, I can't concentrate...
- Oh, God!

1488
02:07:53.407 --> 02:07:54.909
Okay, you know...

1489
02:07:54.942 --> 02:07:59.079
...if you can't handle it, just
tell me, nobody's forcing you to
do anything.

1490
02:07:59.113 --> 02:08:03.150
It's just all this fucking
sneaking around and hiding
things from everyone.

1491
02:08:03.184 --> 02:08:06.387
It's too much. It's... it's
becoming unbearable.

1492
02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:10.224
I mean, they're obviously not
happy with what we're doing in
here.

1493
02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:17.131
Okay, so... Let's just... tell
them the truth.

1494
02:08:20.467 --> 02:08:25.873
You give me something, and I
give you something in return.

1495
02:08:31.011 --> 02:08:33.480
You realize what position
that puts me in?

1496
02:08:34.815 --> 02:08:35.983
No.

1497
02:08:37.818 --> 02:08:41.889
Well, just because it's more
open that you're a flesh
peddler,

1498
02:08:41.922 --> 02:08:43.791
it doesn't mean
they're gonna accept the fact

1499
02:08:43.824 --> 02:08:46.327
that you're buying sex
with the common food.

1500
02:08:47.127 --> 02:08:48.963
Wow...

1501
02:08:50.097 --> 02:08:51.533
Oh, come on, I didn't...

1502
02:08:51.566 --> 02:08:54.101
Do you know the amount of work
I put into this island?

1503
02:08:54.134 --> 02:08:57.238
- I go fishing every day, I make
fire... - I know, I know.

1504
02:08:57.271 --> 02:08:59.907
- I'm responsible for everybody
here! - I know, I'm sorry, I
know.

1505
02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:04.011
- Shouldn't that give me an
advantage? - Yeah, yeah, of
course.

1506
02:09:04.044 --> 02:09:07.781
- Okay! - You deserve to do what
you want, I know.

1507
02:09:15.823 --> 02:09:18.792
The absurd thing is that,
if we were a couple,

1508
02:09:18.826 --> 02:09:21.462
they wouldn't care
what we did in here.

1509
02:09:24.398 --> 02:09:28.269
But, really, maybe we should
just do that, maybe we should
just get on with it.

1510
02:09:28.302 --> 02:09:31.238
I don't know, kiss a little bit
in public and hold hands.

1511
02:09:31.272 --> 02:09:34.041
- Surely that would be easier?
- What about Yaya?

1512
02:09:34.074 --> 02:09:38.145
I would have a conversation with
Yaya. I would have to be an
adult about it.

1513
02:09:38.178 --> 02:09:42.950
And figure it out, but... I
think it would be easier for
her, probably.

1514
02:09:42.983 --> 02:09:45.553
I mean, she's having to deal
with all this gossip as well.

1515
02:09:45.587 --> 02:09:47.988
Carl, I... I don't know.

1516
02:09:56.497 --> 02:09:58.999
Do you want me
to break up with Yaya?

1517
02:09:59.033 --> 02:10:00.535
- No.
- No?

1518
02:10:02.903 --> 02:10:05.306
That's your decision, not mine.

1519
02:10:08.208 --> 02:10:12.279
I'm not asking you to do it, I'm
just seeing what you think about
it.

1520
02:10:12.313 --> 02:10:16.016
I know, but that doesn't mean
that you can put me in-between
the two of you.

1521
02:10:16.050 --> 02:10:17.418
Okay, okay.

1522
02:10:25.926 --> 02:10:28.329
It's kind of a perfect scenario
for you, I mean...

1523
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:32.232
You get what you want,
you have no obligations,

1524
02:10:32.266 --> 02:10:34.501
no responsibilities, you know.

1525
02:10:34.536 --> 02:10:36.870
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

1526
02:10:36.904 --> 02:10:40.240
Because I feel like I need to
know where this is going,
Abigail.

1527
02:10:42.644 --> 02:10:44.878
Let's just have fun.

1528
02:10:44.912 --> 02:10:47.114
No, but I need to try to deal
with this situation.

1529
02:10:47.147 --> 02:10:49.149
I... I don't wanna piss off...

1530
02:10:51.418 --> 02:10:53.854
I don't wanna annoy anyone
anymore.

1531
02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:59.927
Do you remember what you said
the first night you were here?

1532
02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:01.563
What did you say?

1533
02:11:03.665 --> 02:11:06.500
"I love you, you give me fish."

1534
02:11:06.534 --> 02:11:08.235
Exactly.

1535
02:11:08.268 --> 02:11:11.539
And do you know why
that is so beautiful?

1536
02:11:11.573 --> 02:11:13.207
- No.
- Like you...

1537
02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:15.543
- Why?
- Because it's the truth.

1538
02:11:20.948 --> 02:11:23.884
So, Nelson... you're a pirate,
huh?

1539
02:11:25.319 --> 02:11:27.121
Come on, stop it.

1540
02:11:29.256 --> 02:11:32.459
Okay. If I was a pirate,
what would you ask me?

1541
02:11:32.493 --> 02:11:34.995
How much money do you make?

1542
02:11:36.296 --> 02:11:38.165
Yeah, of course.

1543
02:11:38.198 --> 02:11:41.468
I don't know, like... 3,000
euros.

1544
02:11:41.502 --> 02:11:43.904
- On one attack?
- Yeah, one attack.

1545
02:11:44.639 --> 02:11:46.373
If we succeed.

1546
02:11:47.408 --> 02:11:50.477
So, you work on commission, huh?

1547
02:11:50.512 --> 02:11:52.479
- Yeah.
- Shit!

1548
02:11:52.514 --> 02:11:54.915
The client is making all money?

1549
02:11:55.617 --> 02:11:59.052
Yeah, but you can make more
if you have your own boat.

1550
02:12:01.422 --> 02:12:05.025
3,000 euros...
Come on, you're crazy.

1551
02:12:06.059 --> 02:12:08.395
My girlfriend is expensive.

1552
02:12:08.429 --> 02:12:11.198
What? You invest in your
girlfriend?

1553
02:12:11.231 --> 02:12:13.267
- Yeah.
- Ah...

1554
02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:16.003
You should do it
the other way around.

1555
02:12:16.036 --> 02:12:19.306
Invest in business, buy a boat,
and the girls will come to you.

1556
02:12:19.339 --> 02:12:20.407
Yeah?

1557
02:12:21.208 --> 02:12:23.444
Sure, I know. Ha-ha!

1558
02:12:39.293 --> 02:12:41.161
Hey.

1559
02:12:41.195 --> 02:12:44.131
I was just wondering
if I could borrow the backpack.

1560
02:12:44.164 --> 02:12:46.701
- Abigail?
- Yeah, I know.

1561
02:12:46.734 --> 02:12:50.204
- What are you going to do,
Yaya? - Go for a hike over the
mountain.

1562
02:12:50.237 --> 02:12:52.372
See if I can find something.

1563
02:12:55.577 --> 02:12:59.446
- I'll go with you.
- It's okay, I can go by myself.

1564
02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.350
No, Yaya, it's not safe for you
to go alone. I'll go with you.

1565
02:13:04.719 --> 02:13:06.253
Okay.

1566
02:13:10.625 --> 02:13:14.696
- Do you want me to come?
- No. You stay here.

1567
02:13:14.729 --> 02:13:16.764
I need some time alone with her.

1568
02:13:16.798 --> 02:13:18.398
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1569
02:13:24.471 --> 02:13:26.273
I'll take it.

1570
02:13:54.234 --> 02:13:56.403
I'm glad we're doing this
together, Yaya.

1571
02:13:58.438 --> 02:13:59.774
Me, too.

1572
02:14:00.675 --> 02:14:03.310
I actually wanted
to tell you that I'm...

1573
02:14:03.343 --> 02:14:06.213
...really impressed by
everything you're doing here.

1574
02:14:07.147 --> 02:14:10.785
I mean, you managed to run
a fucking matriarchy, Abigail.

1575
02:14:18.593 --> 02:14:21.696
You domesticated
all the old alpha males.

1576
02:14:21.729 --> 02:14:23.263
Yeah!

1577
02:14:26.166 --> 02:14:27.434
Thank you.

1578
02:14:31.371 --> 02:14:33.373
No, it's really impressive.

1579
02:14:41.481 --> 02:14:43.818
We should stick together, huh?

1580
02:15:09.677 --> 02:15:11.411
Oh, my God...

1581
02:15:14.414 --> 02:15:17.217
I think it should be
a little easier from here.

1582
02:16:54.481 --> 02:16:56.517
<i>Nein, nein.</i>

1583
02:16:58.619 --> 02:17:00.220
Huh?

1584
02:17:46.667 --> 02:17:48.636
Abigail!

1585
02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:50.004
Yeah?

1586
02:17:51.338 --> 02:17:53.273
I see something!

1587
02:17:56.778 --> 02:17:59.781
A what?

1588
02:18:01.682 --> 02:18:04.619
I can't hear you!

1589
02:18:07.789 --> 02:18:10.892
- Abigail! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

1590
02:18:12.059 --> 02:18:14.494
- Abigail!
- Yaya!

1591
02:18:16.697 --> 02:18:20.067
Yaya!

1592
02:18:20.101 --> 02:18:21.636
Abigail!

1593
02:18:23.403 --> 02:18:26.774
Abigail!
Abigail, there's an elevator!

1594
02:18:29.577 --> 02:18:31.879
- It's a resort, Abigail!
- A what?

1595
02:18:31.913 --> 02:18:33.648
It's a resort!

1596
02:18:37.151 --> 02:18:41.388
Come, look! It's a luxury
resort!

1597
02:18:45.726 --> 02:18:47.995
It's been there the whole time!

1598
02:18:48.029 --> 02:18:51.398
It's been there
the whole fucking time, Abigail!

1599
02:19:05.146 --> 02:19:06.614
Come.

1600
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:12.887
Come, Abigail. Come.

1601
02:19:20.561 --> 02:19:21.863
Abigail?

1602
02:19:24.098 --> 02:19:26.466
Let's enjoy this moment.

1603
02:20:01.501 --> 02:20:03.838
- It's surreal, huh?
- Yeah.

1604
02:20:18.252 --> 02:20:20.788
You must be excited
to see your kids, huh?

1605
02:20:22.256 --> 02:20:25.425
- I don't have kids.
- Ah...

1606
02:20:26.961 --> 02:20:28.495
Sorry.

1607
02:20:39.106 --> 02:20:40.641
Let's go.

1608
02:20:42.677 --> 02:20:44.145
I need to wee-wee.

1609
02:20:44.979 --> 02:20:47.048
- Yeah.
- And then we will go.

1610
02:20:47.081 --> 02:20:48.549
Okay.

1611
02:21:56.017 --> 02:21:57.551
Abigail?

1612
02:22:01.922 --> 02:22:04.125
Abigail, I can try and help you.

1613
02:22:06.227 --> 02:22:08.629
I don't know how, but...

1614
02:22:12.967 --> 02:22:17.538
Abigail... maybe you can come
and work for me?

1615
02:22:18.039 --> 02:22:20.041
You could be my assistant.

1616
02:22:27.248 --> 02:22:28.783
Aargh!

1617
02:22:42.997 --> 02:22:44.165
Fuck!

1618
02:22:46.333 --> 02:22:47.701
Aargh!
