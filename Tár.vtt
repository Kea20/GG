WEBVTT

1
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.073
WHEN DID SHE WAKE UP

2
00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.241
I WAS NOT THERE WAS THERE

3
00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.951
OUR FRIEND STANDS
EARLY UP, NOT TRUE

4
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.036
TORTURED

5
00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.876
AH!  YOU THINK SHE
HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS

6
00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:47.506
CAN BE

7
00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.431
THEN YOU STILL LOVE HER

8
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.180
- Ready?
- Yes.

9
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.264
Let's go.

10
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:57.858
If you are here, you already know
you already know who she is.

11
00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:01.236
A very important personality
in the world of music.

12
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.156
Lydia Tár has many talents.

13
00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.618
Degree in piano performance
at the Curtis Institute,

14
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.078
Phi Beta Kappa of Harvard.

15
00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:14.291
She received her doctorate in
musicology at the

16
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.752
University of Vienna with
Specialization in indigenous music

17
00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.713
from the Ucayali Valley
in eastern Peru,

18
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:23.133
where she spent five years in the
Shipibo-Konibo tribe.

19
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:27.304
As a conductor, Tár began her

20
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.430
Career with the
Cleveland Orchestra,

21
00:06:28.514 --> 00:06:30.682
one of those with the
nicknamed "The Big Five.

22
00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:32.643
This was followed by a number of
important positions,

23
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.187
in the Philadelphia Orchestra, among others,

24
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.480
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,

25
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.440
the Boston Symphony Orchestra,

26
00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:39.775
until it gets here to our New York

27
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.277
Philharmonic Orchestra is coming.

28
00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:44.238
With the latter she organized
the concerts

29
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:47.366
of the refugees from
Highway Ten in Zaatari,

30
00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.036
where over 75,000
people took part.

31
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.831
She became famous
for her orders

32
00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:55.874
contemporary
works by artists like

33
00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.377
Jennifer Higdon, Caroline Shaw,

34
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.671
Julia Wolfe and Hildur Guðnadóttir.

35
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.715
And she programmed
her works explicitly

36
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.844
at the side of
elite composers.

37
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.637
She was quoted as saying:

38
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.181
"These composers are having a conversation.

39
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:14.101
It may not be
always so polite."

40
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.437
Lydia Tár has also composed music for
composed for stage and screen.

41
00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:21.567
She is actually one
of our 15 EGOTs, which

42
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.236
People who have won the four
biggest have won

43
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.737
Performing Arts Awards:

44
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:26.989
an Emmy, a Grammy,

45
00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.783
an Oscar and a Tony.

46
00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:33.871
As you can imagine,
it is a very short and sparkling

47
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:38.292
List that includes Richard Rodgers, Audrey
Hepburn and Andrew Lloyd Webber

48
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.376
and of course,

49
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.544
Mel Brooks.

50
00:07:44.715 --> 00:07:47.801
In 2010 she founded with
support from Eliot

51
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:50.846
Kaplan the scholarship
for accordion conducting,

52
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.099
entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

53
00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:55.976
promotes for female conductors,

54
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.897
to give them access to residencies in the
largest orchestras in the world.

55
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:05.444
2013 Berlin elected
Tár as successor

56
00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.946
by Andris Davis
as first conductor.

57
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.073
And it's been there ever since.

58
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:15.996
Like her mentor Leonard Bernstein
Tár has a special fondness for Mahler,

59
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:19.750
whose nine symphonies she recorded during
during her five major periods.

60
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.629
However, she never managed to complete the
complete the so-called "cycle".

61
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.423
so far only with an orchestra.

62
00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:29.968
Under his direction Berlin recorded
eight of Mahler's symphonies

63
00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:32.804
and saved the Symphony
No. 5 for the end.

64
00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:34.972
Due to the pandemic
this had to be cancelled for last

65
00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:37.768
year planned performance
be canceled.

66
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.980
Next month she will record
Mahler's Fifth in public,

67
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:46.485
which complete the cycle
and are distributed in a box.

68
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.863
from Deutsche Grammophon,
just in time for Mahler's birthday.

69
00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:53.867
And as if that were not enough
her new book, TÁR

70
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:57.538
on TÁR, released by Nan Talese's
Label published by Doubleday.

71
00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:00.958
Just in time for Christmas a
perfect gift, especially

72
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.293
if you have a very large
Christmas stocking.

73
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.798
All of us at The New Yorker would like to welcome you
welcome.  Thank you for being here, Maestro.

74
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.299
Thank you, Adam.  Thank you very much.

75
00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.972
Lydia, I saw you...

76
00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:19.810
wince slightly,
when I read your biography.

77
00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.896
I have forgotten other fabulous
achievements?

78
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.274
Or are you aware

79
00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:28.527
Incredibly diverse
to have achieved?

80
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:34.533
In this day and age
"variable" is a dirty word.

81
00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.119
Our time is that of the specialists.

82
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:41.582
If you try to do more than one
thing, people don't like it.

83
00:09:41.665 --> 00:09:44.585
- Every artist is cataloged.
- Oh yeah.  Aggressive.

84
00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:48.714
Do you think that the classical music community will
will decide at some point,

85
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:53.343
not to make any gender-specific
differences between artists?

86
00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:58.724
I am the wrong person to contact,
I do not read reviews.

87
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.142
- Never really?
- Nope.

88
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:04.646
But it is strange
that we are forced

89
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.441
felt to replace "maestro" with
to replace "maestra".

90
00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:11.278
We call female astronauts
not "astronauts".

91
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.362
It's true.

92
00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:16.450
But when it comes to
gender bias

93
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.077
I really have no complaints.
no complaints.

94
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.206
And Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta,

95
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.374
Laurence Equilbey and
Nathalie Stuzmann either.

96
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:28.504
There are so many incredible
women who have gone before us.

97
00:10:28.587 --> 00:10:31.089
Women who did the hard work.

98
00:10:31.173 --> 00:10:33.717
It's fascinating.
Can you... Who, for example?

99
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.888
OK, of course.
First Nadia Boulanger.

100
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.099
This is the happy example.

101
00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:44.144
The sad
example, Antonia Brico,

102
00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:47.105
who was an incredible
conductor she was,

103
00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:50.275
who, however, was relegated to the lackluster
status of a "guest conductor

104
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:55.280
locked up and treated like a
treated like a sideshow.

105
00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:58.492
She never had the opportunity
to conduct a large orchestra?

106
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:03.038
Yes. She conducted the
Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and

107
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.624
the Met Orchestra, but
still as a guest conductor.

108
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:10.420
At the time it was ...
a gender identity show.

109
00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:14.383
But times change and the
conversion of this apostle Paul to the

110
00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:17.511
female is developing well, even if
even if it is not yet complete.

111
00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:21.014
Impressive, considering,
that he had fallen off his horse.

112
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:24.101
Lydia, could we talk a little bit
talk about the transposition?

113
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.895
There are still
still people who do not know the

114
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.689
conductor as a human metronome.
metronome.

115
00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:33.277
Yes, that is partially true.

116
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.114
- Yes, but it's...
- Keeping up the pace is not trivial.

117
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:40.409
- Surely it is not only that.
- Yes, I hope so.

118
00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.870
But it all depends on the pace.

119
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.666
The tempo is the essential
element of the interpretation.

120
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.459
You can't start without me.

121
00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:51.587
I start the clock.

122
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.799
My left hand shapes,
but my right hand that

123
00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:59.094
second hand, sets the
sets the pace and drives it forward.

124
00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:03.182
But unlike a watch, my second hand
my second hand sometimes stops,

125
00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:06.476
stops the tempo.

126
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.313
The illusion is,
that I am like you in

127
00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.149
real time to the
orchestra in real time,

128
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.986
to make the decision at the right
to make the decision to reorganize everything

129
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.322
start, restart or eliminate the
eliminate the tempo forever.

130
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.491
The reality is right off the bat,

131
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:24.119
I know exactly what time it is

132
00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:28.790
and the exact moment when we
arrive together at our destination.

133
00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:33.545
The only real
discovery for me is the sample.

134
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:35.047
Never during the performance.

135
00:12:36.173 --> 00:12:40.302
Difficult question when
you define a thing

136
00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.471
Bernstein gave you, what would it be?
gave you, what would it be?

137
00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.099
Kavanah.

138
00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:50.395
Yes, this is the Hebrew word for.
attention to meaning or intention.

139
00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:52.898
Define the
Priorities of the composer

140
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.775
and yours and how they
complement each other.

141
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:55.859
Yes, Kavana.

142
00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:59.154
This word will have a different meaning for a large part of the
public will have a different meaning.

143
00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:01.240
Yes, I can imagine.

144
00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:05.160
Am I correct in my
Assumption that the conductor in

145
00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:07.162
of classical music was not
always been a stage presence?

146
00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:08.247
No, it's true.

147
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.959
I have read that the
first violin was responsible for this.

148
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:16.255
Yes, the first fiddle, whether he
has interest or ability or not.

149
00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:19.299
When did it change and who changed it?

150
00:13:19.383 --> 00:13:22.719
With the French
composer Jean-Baptiste Lully,

151
00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:28.350
who used a huge pointed
stick to cut the

152
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.561
to mark the tempo by
he hit the ground.

153
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.856
I guess the musicians
did not appreciate it very much.

154
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:37.985
This technique ended
during a performance when

155
00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:42.281
Lully accidentally cut his foot
cut his foot and died.

156
00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.366
Yes, gangrene.

157
00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:46.785
But anyway...

158
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.250
In any case
the conductor really

159
00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:57.254
indispensable when
the orchestra grows.

160
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.548
And once again we come
we come back to Beethoven.

161
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.970
It does not start
with the eighth note.

162
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:09.099
Time struck... silent.

163
00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:11.852
Someone had to set the pace
for this section.

164
00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:14.897
Someone had to
Flag in the sand

165
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.399
And say, "Follow me."

166
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.443
And when that person
was Lenny, the

167
00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:25.157
orchestra on an
extraordinary journey.

168
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.202
Because he knew music,
especially Mahler,

169
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:30.454
as good or better
than anyone else.

170
00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.248
And he often played with composition.

171
00:14:33.332 --> 00:14:36.251
Because he wanted the
orchestra give the impression,

172
00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:40.255
never seen this music,
heard or interpreted this music.

173
00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:42.382
So he did radical
things, like ignoring

174
00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:47.429
Tempo Primo or the
Ending with Molto Ritardando,

175
00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:49.556
even without such comments.

176
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.933
Was that exaggeration on his part?

177
00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.352
No no.  Absolutely not.

178
00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:56.146
He celebrated the joy of discovery.

179
00:14:57.064 --> 00:15:00.817
You told us that your
discovery occurs repeatedly.

180
00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.903
When does this
process for you again?

181
00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:05.197
We start on Monday.

182
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:06.823
Immediately?

183
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.993
With this one it is like this

184
00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:13.830
Mahler's intention in
to read the tea leaves.

185
00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:17.543
With his other symphonies
we are very well informed about it.

186
00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:19.795
He was so enthusiastic about Rückert's
so enthusiastic about Rückert's poetry that

187
00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:22.381
he did not set
set any other text to music.

188
00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.259
But everything changes with the fifth.

189
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.803
The fifth is a mystery.

190
00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:32.558
The only clue he leaves us,
is on the cover of the manuscript.

191
00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:36.687
Yes, the dedication to
his new wife Alma.

192
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.649
So when we join Mahler for
his fifth symphony,

193
00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:44.695
The first thing to do
is to try,

194
00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.823
this very complex
marriage to understand.

195
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:50.868
Do you have an interpretation of this marriage

196
00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.369
different from amber?

197
00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:58.750
You mentioned my ethnographic
research in the Amazon.

198
00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:04.298
Well, the Shipibo-Konibo
get only one icaro or song,

199
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:06.258
when the singer is there
is, on the same

200
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:09.761
Page like the spirit,
who created him.

201
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.473
And so merge
past and present.

202
00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:16.435
They are two sides
of the same cosmic coin.

203
00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:20.355
I understand this
definition of fidelity.

204
00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:22.482
But Lenny believed in Chuwa.

205
00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:25.277
The Talmudic power to
turn back time and

206
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.156
change the meaning of your
to change past deeds.

207
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:32.993
When he played the "Adagietto" at the funeral of
Robert Kennedy, he played the "Adagietto",

208
00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.079
it took 12 minutes.

209
00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:38.290
- He interpreted it as mass.
- Yes.

210
00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.375
And when you listen to a
listening to a recording of it, you will

211
00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:44.087
you certainly feel the tragedy
and pathos you feel.

212
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:48.884
This interpretation was very true for Mahler
very true later in life, after

213
00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:53.096
his career had failed
and when Alma left him for Gropius.

214
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:58.060
But as I said before,
it's all a question of time.

215
00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:02.439
And this work was not born during
born during a painful tragedy.

216
00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:05.192
She was born during a budding love affair.

217
00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.484
So you choose...

218
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.737
Love.

219
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.490
Yes, but for how long?

220
00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:14.576
Seven minutes.

221
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.167
I loved what you said to Adam ....

222
00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:29.132
on the interpretation
and especially the feelings.

223
00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:30.968
And that you have chosen love.

224
00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:36.098
I know they say you should leave the tears
for the audience, but...

225
00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:40.310
do you sometimes feel
overwhelmed by emotions

226
00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:42.563
- when you are on the podium?
- Yes.

227
00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:45.274
Yes, it happens.

228
00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:49.444
With certain works there is
a cycle of expectation and

229
00:17:49.528 --> 00:17:53.115
Reward, and there are parts
of it that I find so incredible,

230
00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:57.244
that when I lead,
not really faster

231
00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:58.704
but I am looking forward
to arriving there.

232
00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.415
Yes, it does for me.  Every time.

233
00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.960
So it's physical
and emotional at the same time.

234
00:18:06.003 --> 00:18:08.463
It must take hours
to return to earth.

235
00:18:09.131 --> 00:18:11.884
You say things that
others remember, but you yourself don't.

236
00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.678
And sleeping is impossible.

237
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.597
It's like my first year at Smith.

238
00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.144
What piece has that effect on you?

239
00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:23.270
Oh, I saw you!

240
00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:27.024
I saw you at the Met last year,
when you staged The Rite of Spring.

241
00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.568
It was very powerful.

242
00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.612
Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.

243
00:18:33.197 --> 00:18:35.616
It is the 11 pistol shots....
it is a prime number...

244
00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:38.410
that comes across as
victim and aggressor.

245
00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:42.039
It was only when I directed
I was away from it

246
00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.665
convinced that we
are all capable of murder.

247
00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:46.585
It's a fantastic bag, by the way.

248
00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.712
Thank you very much.  Glad you like it.

249
00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.006
Oh, a lot.  A lot.

250
00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:54.176
We are sorry.  Your dinner
with Mr. Kaplan.  His driver is waiting.

251
00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.887
OK.  I'm sorry, I forgot
I forgot your name.

252
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.639
- Whitney.  Whitney Reese.
- Whitney.

253
00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.057
Whitney, of course.

254
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.684
Sorry, unfortunately
I am a little late,

255
00:19:02.768 --> 00:19:06.313
- I have an important meeting.
- I see.  Can I write to you?

256
00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:11.068
LIVE THEY SEE WHAT I SEE

257
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:14.154
THE BEDROOM OF PLACIDO DOMINGO.

258
00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.495
SHE THINKS SHE IS BEING IRONIC

259
00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:28.418
That's perfect, Aldo.

260
00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:34.132
I was hoping we could celebrate.

261
00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:36.218
No.  Me too.

262
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:37.803
I have a class at Juilliard.

263
00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:38.887
Good.

264
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:40.305
I promised Ben.

265
00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:43.976
I am sure you will apply for
the accordion scholarship.

266
00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:47.855
We should expand the scholarship.

267
00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:50.232
- The number of applicants?
- No, our gender.

268
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:53.485
It seems strange to reserve it for only
to reserve it for only one gender.

269
00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:54.820
We have proven our point.

270
00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:58.490
And we had no problems
placing them successfully.

271
00:19:58.574 --> 00:19:59.908
Except one.

272
00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:01.660
Oh good.

273
00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:04.079
She had problems.

274
00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:05.455
That's what I was told.

275
00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:09.376
The topic comes up at every meeting at
Citibank with his father.

276
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.004
We are sorry.

277
00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.422
How are you.

278
00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.340
I can handle it.

279
00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:20.512
Do you want to destroy the founding principle
of L'Accordéon?

280
00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:22.639
We would lose donors.

281
00:20:23.432 --> 00:20:25.475
Yes, that's probably true.

282
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.895
Maybe we can try it later.

283
00:20:27.978 --> 00:20:29.646
Sure.

284
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.107
Bryant Park is booked for the 25th.

285
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:33.984
Nan asked me to fill the
fill the room, the

286
00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:37.613
Kaplan Foundation will buy radio
and buy outdoor advertising.

287
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.948
And clickers.

288
00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:43.118
It's too big, Eliot.
She should have booked the beach.

289
00:20:43.202 --> 00:20:46.121
Relax.  It will be perfect.

290
00:20:47.206 --> 00:20:49.082
And it almost falls on your birthday.

291
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.214
I'm sorry you couldn't come to my 3rd.
I'm sorry you couldn't come to my third year with Mahler in London.

292
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.966
Me too.

293
00:21:00.177 --> 00:21:01.762
Petra had a thing at school.

294
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:06.683
And I promised Sharon that I would be there.

295
00:21:07.643 --> 00:21:08.769
Sure.

296
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.272
I was just hoping to get your opinion.

297
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.193
My evaluation forms
were excellent.

298
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.819
They are confidential, Eliot.

299
00:21:17.903 --> 00:21:20.113
The first oboist is a big fan.

300
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.910
When I got home, I listened to
yours with the Israel Philharmonic.

301
00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:27.371
I was overwhelmed
by what you had to say in the

302
00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.331
last movement from the
strings have got.

303
00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.167
How did you bring them
to this level?

304
00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:35.838
Was it the room?  The musicians?

305
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.632
The musicians were not satisfied.

306
00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.760
The first violin came to me after
the first rehearsal to me

307
00:21:41.844 --> 00:21:44.179
- and asked me if I was Jewish.
- What?

308
00:21:44.263 --> 00:21:46.390
It seemed unusual,
almost suspicious

309
00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:50.686
that a non-Jew would like to conduct
would like to conduct music.

310
00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.980
I felt like Max Bruch.

311
00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:55.023
Being very Jewish myself,

312
00:21:55.107 --> 00:21:58.235
the Kaplan Foundation
awarded them a

313
00:21:58.318 --> 00:21:59.736
large sum for the
Order of a Klezmer.

314
00:22:00.863 --> 00:22:04.283
- Maybe they'll invite me to conduct.
- They are lucky to have you.

315
00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.452
You are welcome.
I am aware of my position.

316
00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:10.539
Money can't buy everything.

317
00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.792
You don't really believe it.

318
00:22:14.418 --> 00:22:17.880
Know that I tried to bribe Francesca
to bribe her to see your grades.

319
00:22:17.963 --> 00:22:19.506
She sent me to hell.

320
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.549
Cheer.

321
00:22:21.592 --> 00:22:23.927
The gentleman sits over there with the gnome

322
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:26.305
has his eyes glued to our table.

323
00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:29.224
At first I thought he saw me

324
00:22:29.308 --> 00:22:31.643
but I think
he's looking at you.

325
00:22:31.727 --> 00:22:33.645
Try to ignore it.

326
00:22:33.729 --> 00:22:37.232
I can wash my hands
wash my hands if you want to be alone.

327
00:22:37.316 --> 00:22:39.109
And I will never forgive you.

328
00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.529
I don't need to be told here by someone

329
00:22:42.613 --> 00:22:44.364
just like me
be held.

330
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.618
What time are you going tomorrow?

331
00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:51.079
Francesca watches the flights.

332
00:22:51.163 --> 00:22:53.874
Tell him to stop.  Leave whenever you want.

333
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.627
You do not have to do this.

334
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.254
My motives are
not entirely altruistic.

335
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.799
A look at your performance notes.

336
00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:06.762
Good.

337
00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:10.140
- 5:15 pm, how are you?
- Good.

338
00:23:10.224 --> 00:23:13.185
OK, I have to go quickly.

339
00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:15.103
We are recruiting for a vacant position.

340
00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:17.523
Tell me it's Sebastian.

341
00:23:17.606 --> 00:23:21.193
Be fair, Eliot.
Sebastian has a decent technique.

342
00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:22.736
He has the magic wand.

343
00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.446
A month ago I was in
Bunkamura to see how the

344
00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.115
well-oiled touring machine
plays Chopin's Concerto No. 1.

345
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.911
Good old Sebastian
is Mr. Tempo Stolen.

346
00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.996
It would be more like Tempo De-Robot.

347
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.748
Why do you keep it?

348
00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:36.458
He's Andris's protégé, you know that.

349
00:23:36.542 --> 00:23:38.085
Exactly.  You have inherited this
inherited this decision.

350
00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:40.337
Seven years is a long time to
to pretend to respect them.

351
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.673
There they have
different employment contracts.

352
00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:47.886
He is a strange guy.

353
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.055
- Who?  Andreas?
- No Sebastian.

354
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:53.517
He has fetishes.

355
00:23:54.101 --> 00:23:55.978
Fetishes?  Like what?

356
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:58.897
Nostalgia for Kalmus'
Miniature scores from the pre-war period,

357
00:23:58.981 --> 00:24:03.443
the pens he saw in photos of
of Karajan in his hand.

358
00:24:03.527 --> 00:24:05.195
This kind of thing.

359
00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:07.406
It's sad.

360
00:24:12.077 --> 00:24:13.954
Yes, but you're not wrong.

361
00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:17.249
I will have to replace it.

362
00:24:20.002 --> 00:24:21.295
From whom?

363
00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:29.928
What love tells me.
This note for the strings.

364
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.682
Mahler gives it to you personally.

365
00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:36.268
Boring, peaceful,
deeply felt.

366
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:37.352
Let's go.

367
00:24:37.436 --> 00:24:41.231
Trust me, you don't want to
use other people's ideas.

368
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.317
Even less mine.

369
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.610
But I want to do it.

370
00:24:44.693 --> 00:24:47.446
- Will you stop bothering me?
- Yes.

371
00:24:48.947 --> 00:24:50.199
Free bows.

372
00:24:52.201 --> 00:24:54.661
Not a pretty sight for an audience.

373
00:24:54.745 --> 00:24:57.581
But if you can keep your musicians
can keep them focused,

374
00:24:58.874 --> 00:25:00.626
the sound is ingenious.

375
00:25:07.758 --> 00:25:10.677
There is no glory for a robot.

376
00:25:14.932 --> 00:25:16.308
Do your own research.

377
00:25:39.248 --> 00:25:40.332
OK.

378
00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:44.169
Let's stop here.

379
00:25:44.253 --> 00:25:46.088
- Thanks Max.  Very good.
- Thank you very much.

380
00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:50.092
Just so I understand,

381
00:25:51.343 --> 00:25:53.345
Why did you come to Juillard?

382
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.976
It is the best
music conservatory in the country.

383
00:25:59.059 --> 00:26:01.854
The people at Curtis and
Eastman might dispute that.

384
00:26:01.937 --> 00:26:04.147
Juillard is a brand, isn't it?

385
00:26:04.231 --> 00:26:07.401
Did you come to study with a brand?

386
00:26:07.484 --> 00:26:08.485
- Nope.
- No, that's it.

387
00:26:08.569 --> 00:26:11.113
A teacher or graduate
has at some point in your

388
00:26:11.196 --> 00:26:13.323
Life triggered something in your
imagination triggered.

389
00:26:13.407 --> 00:26:15.242
Someone you aspire to become.

390
00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:17.494
So who was it?

391
00:26:17.578 --> 00:26:18.829
Sarah Chang.

392
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.998
- Are you a violinist?
- Yes.

393
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:22.499
Ok okay.

394
00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:26.962
I understand why you decided
to conduct this piece.

395
00:26:27.045 --> 00:26:30.716
It must be a familiar
pleasure to listen to all these strings

396
00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:32.926
who behave as if they were
behave as if they were tuned.

397
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:38.599
This piece is very topical.

398
00:26:38.682 --> 00:26:42.060
And here the composer tells us,
that we should start with

399
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:44.396
"Back and forth tremolo movements
with a metal brush

400
00:26:44.479 --> 00:26:47.566
and rattlesnakes that
slowly glide across the skin."

401
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:50.527
Looks like the
René Redzepi's reindeer recipe.

402
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.323
It's exciting to play new
music, isn't it?

403
00:26:54.406 --> 00:26:55.741
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:26:55.824 --> 00:26:59.077
Perfect.  All right, go
to the other fellows.

405
00:27:00.746 --> 00:27:05.334
I know that you are all studying with
Mr. Wolfe conducting,

406
00:27:05.417 --> 00:27:09.505
but how many of you
also study composition?

407
00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:11.590
Yes, your name?

408
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:12.841
Olive Kerr.

409
00:27:13.467 --> 00:27:14.635
All right, Olive.

410
00:27:16.053 --> 00:27:18.222
What do you think about,
of what we just heard?

411
00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:23.268
It's great.  There is an
incredible atonal tension.

412
00:27:23.352 --> 00:27:25.646
I agree about the tension.

413
00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:29.650
You can think intellectually
or physically enjoy

414
00:27:29.733 --> 00:27:33.445
the bliss of this
so-called "atonal" element,

415
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:39.201
but the important question
is: what do you use to lead the way?

416
00:27:39.284 --> 00:27:43.830
What effect is achieved?
What interests me?

417
00:27:43.914 --> 00:27:49.294
Good music can be as ornate as
a cathedral or as bare as a pot

418
00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:53.257
as long as it enables you
answer these two questions.

419
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.424
max.

420
00:27:55.634 --> 00:27:57.219
What do you think?

421
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:05.602
When Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class,

422
00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:08.689
she said she was influenced by the
been influenced by the form

423
00:28:09.523 --> 00:28:13.986
and the structure of the landscapes and
nature in which she grew up.

424
00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:20.742
But I'm not sure she was interested in describing those sounds.
was interested in describing these sounds.

425
00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:22.661
Very point counterpoint.

426
00:28:24.538 --> 00:28:25.789
Yes.

427
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:31.128
The least we can say is that
the intention of its composition is vague.

428
00:28:31.211 --> 00:28:34.047
If his intention is vague, like

429
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:38.760
As a conductor, do you have
a point of view?

430
00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:43.473
To be fair, sometimes
you have no choice.

431
00:28:43.557 --> 00:28:46.059
And you have to face
face an orchestra

432
00:28:46.143 --> 00:28:50.314
and pretend that there are
invisible structures.

433
00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:54.693
And I pray you don't know the
shame of having a 433 on the

434
00:28:54.776 --> 00:28:59.448
podium as if you were selling a
you are selling a car without an engine!

435
00:28:59.531 --> 00:29:03.785
Because, my friends,
now is the time, music

436
00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:08.290
to conduct, which requires something
demanded of you.

437
00:29:08.373 --> 00:29:11.585
Music that everyone
knows, but different

438
00:29:11.668 --> 00:29:14.880
will hear when
you show them off.

439
00:29:14.963 --> 00:29:18.800
Max, how about a Kyrie?

440
00:29:18.884 --> 00:29:22.721
Something like Bach's Mass in B minor.

441
00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:26.767
I am not interested in Bach.

442
00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:29.144
Not in the mood for Bach?

443
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.104
Ah Max.

444
00:29:32.898 --> 00:29:34.942
Have you read Schweitzer's book?

445
00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:36.193
No.

446
00:29:36.777 --> 00:29:39.863
You should.  It is an important text.

447
00:29:40.822 --> 00:29:43.158
This was the opinion of Antonia Brico.

448
00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:45.827
So much so that she went to
Equatorial Africa and worked in a

449
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:48.872
canoe up the Congo,
to join Schweitzer

450
00:29:48.956 --> 00:29:52.292
and ask him to teach him
what he knew about Bach.

451
00:29:52.376 --> 00:29:56.004
I have a picture of
her with a pith helmet,

452
00:29:56.088 --> 00:29:57.631
Did you...

453
00:29:57.714 --> 00:30:01.426
Did you play or conduct Bach?

454
00:30:02.344 --> 00:30:07.224
Honestly, as a BIPOC and
Pangender person, I will say,

455
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:12.187
that Bach's misogynistic
life really prevents me

456
00:30:12.271 --> 00:30:14.356
to take his music seriously.

457
00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:18.026
Let's go.

458
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.445
What do you mean?

459
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.867
He has not fathered 20 children?

460
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.327
Yes, it is documented.

461
00:30:27.411 --> 00:30:29.997
With an incredible number of partitions.

462
00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:32.833
I apologize
myself, I understand

463
00:30:32.916 --> 00:30:35.711
not what his
talents are in the marriage bed

464
00:30:35.794 --> 00:30:37.963
have to do with B minor.

465
00:30:39.298 --> 00:30:43.010
Yes. Okay, whatever
whatever, it's your choice.

466
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.430
After all, "a soul chooses
its own society."

467
00:30:46.513 --> 00:30:49.183
But remember,
that the downside of this choice,

468
00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:51.935
is that it reduces your attention.

469
00:30:52.394 --> 00:30:57.858
Separating what is acceptable
and what is not, is today

470
00:30:57.941 --> 00:31:02.112
the fundamental basis
of many symphony orchestras.

471
00:31:02.196 --> 00:31:05.991
who consider it their supreme right
to get rid of idiots.

472
00:31:06.074 --> 00:31:11.747
As unreliable as it is, the investigation
of Max's allergy is meritorious.

473
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.582
Classical music,

474
00:31:13.665 --> 00:31:17.169
composed by white, pious,
Austro-Hungarian and heterosexual types,

475
00:31:17.252 --> 00:31:20.672
Can it uplift us individually
and collectively uplift us,

476
00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:24.343
and who can decide?

477
00:31:26.053 --> 00:31:28.222
And Beethoven?

478
00:31:28.305 --> 00:31:29.848
Are you interested?

479
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.893
As a lesbian who is ready to
to commit on the first night,

480
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:36.188
I am not sure whether
I like good old Ludwig.

481
00:31:37.231 --> 00:31:40.067
But I confront him.

482
00:31:40.776 --> 00:31:45.280
And I will be with its extent

483
00:31:45.364 --> 00:31:46.823
and its
and its inevitability.

484
00:31:49.743 --> 00:31:51.828
Come on, Maxi.  Do me a favor.

485
00:31:52.454 --> 00:31:55.207
Have Bach examined
examined in this way.

486
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.421
Sit down.

487
00:32:05.092 --> 00:32:07.135
It's difficult, isn't it?

488
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.223
It could be a piano student
in the first year.

489
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.645
Or Schröder playing for Lucy

490
00:32:19.565 --> 00:32:21.358
Or Glenn Gould.

491
00:32:26.572 --> 00:32:28.574
Only if something changes...

492
00:32:30.534 --> 00:32:32.911
that we enter it and that
we hear what it really is

493
00:32:32.995 --> 00:32:34.329
It's a question.

494
00:32:37.499 --> 00:32:38.876
And an answer.

495
00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:43.046
Which begs another question.

496
00:32:45.924 --> 00:32:48.468
There is a humility in Bach.

497
00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:51.221
He does not claim to be sure of anything.

498
00:32:52.514 --> 00:32:57.060
Because he knows that it is always the
question that moves the listener.

499
00:32:58.187 --> 00:33:00.814
Never the answer, right?

500
00:33:01.398 --> 00:33:04.109
The big question I ask you,

501
00:33:04.193 --> 00:33:06.653
it's: What do you think, Max?

502
00:33:13.076 --> 00:33:14.620
They play very well.

503
00:33:15.787 --> 00:33:21.752
But white men, cisgender composers,
that's not my thing.

504
00:33:21.835 --> 00:33:26.089
Don't be in such a hurry to be offended.

505
00:33:26.173 --> 00:33:30.427
The narcissism of small differences
leads to boring conformity.

506
00:33:31.178 --> 00:33:33.180
I suppose Edgard
Varèse is acceptable.

507
00:33:33.263 --> 00:33:34.848
Anyway, I like Arcana.

508
00:33:34.932 --> 00:33:39.645
So you must know that
Varèse once said that jazz

509
00:33:39.728 --> 00:33:43.649
is "a Negro product exploited by the
exploited by the Jews".

510
00:33:44.983 --> 00:33:47.194
That did not stop Jerry
Goldsmith from using him for

511
00:33:47.277 --> 00:33:49.530
plagiarize the music of his Planet
of the apes to plagiarize.

512
00:33:49.613 --> 00:33:51.990
This is the perfect
insult, don't you think?

513
00:33:52.074 --> 00:33:53.617
But the problem,
when you find yourself

514
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:58.497
as epistemic
dissident defined,

515
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.835
is that, if Bach's talent is based on his
gender, his native country, his religion,

516
00:34:02.918 --> 00:34:06.296
his sexuality and so on.
can be, yours can.

517
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.385
One day, when you are in the
big world and are invited

518
00:34:11.467 --> 00:34:14.929
conducting a large or small orchestra
small orchestra to conduct,

519
00:34:15.013 --> 00:34:16.639
You will find
that musicians are more than

520
00:34:16.723 --> 00:34:19.810
light bulbs and music on their
have on their desks.

521
00:34:20.768 --> 00:34:23.730
You have also received
Evaluation forms received,

522
00:34:23.813 --> 00:34:26.608
whose purpose is
is to evaluate you.

523
00:34:26.692 --> 00:34:31.280
What criteria should
they use for this?

524
00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.992
Your musical reading and
stick technique or something else?

525
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:44.083
Let's all look at his subject using
Max's criteria to look at his subject.

526
00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:47.004
In this case Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

527
00:34:47.087 --> 00:34:50.757
Can we agree on two
observation points?

528
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:53.552
First, that Anna was born in Iceland.

529
00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:58.557
Then that she, like a
Waldorf teacher, is a super sexy woman!

530
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.100
Raise your hands.

531
00:35:00.893 --> 00:35:04.521
Let's turn to the piano,

532
00:35:04.605 --> 00:35:07.774
and let's see how
one of these elements

533
00:35:07.858 --> 00:35:11.111
to the person
refers to the person sitting in front of us.

534
00:35:17.326 --> 00:35:18.744
Where are you going?

535
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:24.082
You are a fucking bitch.

536
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.085
And you are a robot.

537
00:35:27.669 --> 00:35:32.382
Unfortunately, the architects
of your soul seem to be social media.

538
00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:36.512
To perform the mask dance,
one must honor the composer.

539
00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:40.098
You must sublimate yourself, your ego
and sublimate your identity.

540
00:35:40.724 --> 00:35:42.976
You have to face the
public and

541
00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.103
God and extinguish yourself
erase yourself.

542
00:35:48.524 --> 00:35:49.775
OK.

543
00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:42.327
Jake said you
want the seat cover.

544
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:43.579
I will be,
if I make it,

545
00:36:43.662 --> 00:36:46.498
Weight gain until
next month to avoid.

546
00:36:46.582 --> 00:36:48.125
You never get fat.

547
00:36:52.421 --> 00:36:54.756
Your mother wrote to me.

548
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.301
She knows you're busy,
but she'd like to come by.

549
00:36:58.594 --> 00:36:59.595
Next time.

550
00:37:00.429 --> 00:37:02.097
Do you have any ideas for dinner?

551
00:37:02.931 --> 00:37:03.932
No.

552
00:37:04.016 --> 00:37:07.186
No, I stay here and
bring this piano to life.

553
00:37:07.269 --> 00:37:10.898
I have doubts about the
natural E in the cello line.

554
00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:14.276
Does it not seem to you to have the warm
tonality of a Charles Ives?

555
00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:15.986
Absolutely not.

556
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:19.448
Don't worry, I'll call Houston
Houston.  They will understand.

557
00:37:20.115 --> 00:37:23.160
You have to see some
New Haven friends tonight?

558
00:37:24.161 --> 00:37:25.787
No.  Not really.

559
00:37:28.415 --> 00:37:31.293
I'll go later for the notes?

560
00:37:31.376 --> 00:37:33.170
No, that will not be necessary.

561
00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:35.631
OK.

562
00:37:38.926 --> 00:37:42.429
I almost forgot...

563
00:37:44.389 --> 00:37:46.892
it was left for you at the reception.

564
00:37:46.975 --> 00:37:47.976
From whom?

565
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.436
They didn't say.

566
00:37:50.062 --> 00:37:51.480
What, no map?

567
00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:53.023
No.

568
00:37:53.106 --> 00:37:55.901
Okay, leave it there.  Thank you very much.

569
00:38:07.204 --> 00:38:08.372
Good evening.

570
00:38:08.455 --> 00:38:09.540
Good evening.

571
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.879
When were you informed?

572
00:38:56.962 --> 00:38:58.672
This morning.

573
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.842
Mr. Kaplan apologized profusely.

574
00:39:01.925 --> 00:39:04.928
I was able to get us on the 7:00 flight
you like, via Munich.

575
00:39:05.012 --> 00:39:08.098
Little time for correspondence,
but special services are there.

576
00:39:08.182 --> 00:39:09.600
Where do we stand with DG?

577
00:39:10.767 --> 00:39:13.061
Tell me they have finally
realized that he is wise

578
00:39:13.145 --> 00:39:15.647
authentic 33 rpm for
to make this version.

579
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:17.524
No signs of life yet.

580
00:39:17.608 --> 00:39:19.401
Did you see the e-mail
I wrote for you?

581
00:39:19.484 --> 00:39:22.446
- Sent last night.
- Let me follow their response.

582
00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:26.867
What do you think about the
conversation with The New Yorker?

583
00:39:28.702 --> 00:39:30.537
It went well, in my opinion.

584
00:39:30.621 --> 00:39:31.872
You are slipping away.

585
00:39:32.998 --> 00:39:34.082
I was talkative.

586
00:39:34.166 --> 00:39:35.626
No.

587
00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:38.086
No way.  You were fabulous.

588
00:39:39.129 --> 00:39:40.672
Francesca.

589
00:39:40.756 --> 00:39:43.091
If you are interested in
Conducting interested

590
00:39:43.175 --> 00:39:45.093
are, you must
be able to speak openly.

591
00:39:45.177 --> 00:39:49.515
Maybe you should have talked less about
about the relationship with...

592
00:39:49.598 --> 00:39:50.641
Lenny?

593
00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:54.102
No, I was thinking of Mahler and Alma.

594
00:39:54.186 --> 00:39:58.232
You implied that she had
betrayed him.  I do not agree.

595
00:39:58.732 --> 00:39:59.942
Oh, really?

596
00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:03.904
Alma also composed.
But he insisted that she stop.

597
00:40:03.987 --> 00:40:05.447
Said there was only room for....

598
00:40:05.531 --> 00:40:07.950
- An asshole in the house?
- ... an asshole.  Yes.

599
00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:11.787
She accepted these rules.
No one decided for her.

600
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.831
#Game rules.

601
00:40:28.178 --> 00:40:29.388
How was your evening?

602
00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:31.181
Without stories.

603
00:40:32.015 --> 00:40:34.351
Are there any Sharon pills left?

604
00:40:34.434 --> 00:40:37.563
No, but doctor
Korovin ordered them.

605
00:40:38.146 --> 00:40:39.314
Thank you very much.

606
00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:50.117
I have received another strange
email from Krista.

607
00:40:51.827 --> 00:40:53.662
How should I react?

608
00:40:53.745 --> 00:40:54.830
TU it does not.

609
00:40:57.124 --> 00:40:59.877
This one was really desperate.

610
00:41:00.961 --> 00:41:03.463
Hope dies last.

611
00:42:23.585 --> 00:42:25.879
IN DANGER

612
00:43:01.123 --> 00:43:04.835
You get benefits from the

613
00:43:04.918 --> 00:43:06.378
Energy supplier,
without me knowing it?

614
00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:09.423
The heart palpitations returned.

615
00:43:10.257 --> 00:43:12.885
It... it throbs.

616
00:43:14.052 --> 00:43:16.471
I can't find my metoprolol anymore.

617
00:43:33.864 --> 00:43:37.743
I found this in the drawer.

618
00:43:40.037 --> 00:43:41.330
It is the good?

619
00:43:43.832 --> 00:43:44.833
Yes.

620
00:43:50.547 --> 00:43:51.715
Thank you very much.

621
00:43:55.552 --> 00:43:57.054
Is it a new bag?

622
00:43:57.721 --> 00:44:00.140
Just a gift from Eliot.

623
00:44:00.224 --> 00:44:01.183
You want it?

624
00:44:04.228 --> 00:44:05.437
You are fine.

625
00:44:07.523 --> 00:44:08.524
Let's slow it down...

626
00:44:09.525 --> 00:44:13.028
at 60 beats per minute.

627
00:44:36.969 --> 00:44:39.471
In fact, it is 64 strokes.

628
00:44:43.892 --> 00:44:46.395
I tried last night,
to call you on your cell phone.

629
00:44:48.522 --> 00:44:50.774
And again at the hotel.

630
00:44:51.441 --> 00:44:53.235
I had to sleep.

631
00:44:54.987 --> 00:44:56.655
You've never slept so well.

632
00:44:56.738 --> 00:44:58.866
Don't scold me.

633
00:45:11.211 --> 00:45:13.172
I am worried about Petra.

634
00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:18.635
She begins to keep it all inside.

635
00:45:20.053 --> 00:45:21.680
Be clearer.

636
00:45:25.017 --> 00:45:27.895
She comes home with bruises on
on her shins.

637
00:45:29.438 --> 00:45:32.566
When I ask her about it
she remains silent.

638
00:45:34.443 --> 00:45:36.737
I hope it is
only soccer and

639
00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.115
not something from
the bio-German.

640
00:45:40.199 --> 00:45:42.201
That's what we were talking about.

641
00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:48.957
Maybe we need to try harder,
to find a friend for him.

642
00:45:50.209 --> 00:45:52.127
Last year it was
very difficult with two

643
00:45:52.211 --> 00:45:55.422
old ladies like us
to be locked up alone.

644
00:45:59.051 --> 00:46:01.261
She is old enough
to learn the piano.

645
00:46:03.847 --> 00:46:05.265
I will teach him.

646
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:13.982
It could be good.

647
00:46:16.193 --> 00:46:17.778
How is your heart?

648
00:46:19.363 --> 00:46:20.822
Better now.

649
00:46:43.512 --> 00:46:45.931
Knock knock.  Who is here?

650
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.975
Lenny?

651
00:46:49.184 --> 00:46:50.477
Walter?

652
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:54.273
It's you, MTT.

653
00:46:54.982 --> 00:46:57.985
Why do you insist
delay everything like this?

654
00:46:58.068 --> 00:47:03.198
You have to be happy, not scream like
like a fucking porn star.

655
00:47:03.282 --> 00:47:04.867
... Michael Tilson Thomas ...

656
00:47:13.959 --> 00:47:15.377
Hello Petra.

657
00:47:18.088 --> 00:47:20.465
Why are you hiding?

658
00:47:21.717 --> 00:47:23.719
Tell me and I will help you.

659
00:47:24.636 --> 00:47:25.637
Sharon.

660
00:47:26.346 --> 00:47:28.599
I take Petra to school.

661
00:47:30.142 --> 00:47:31.727
- Come.
- Bye.

662
00:47:52.831 --> 00:47:54.875
"Who will carry the shroud?"

663
00:47:55.792 --> 00:47:57.336
"We," said the wren.

664
00:47:57.419 --> 00:48:00.464
- "The rooster and the hen."
- "The hen."

665
00:48:00.547 --> 00:48:02.090
"I'm going"...

666
00:48:02.174 --> 00:48:04.760
"We will wear the shroud."

667
00:48:04.843 --> 00:48:06.220
"And who will sing a psalm?"

668
00:48:06.303 --> 00:48:09.640
"I do," said the thrush, which
sat down on a bush.

669
00:48:10.766 --> 00:48:12.851
"I'm going to sing a song."

670
00:48:12.935 --> 00:48:14.811
"Who will ring the bell?"

671
00:48:14.895 --> 00:48:18.440
"Me," says the bull,
because I can shoot.

672
00:48:19.149 --> 00:48:20.943
I'm ringing the bell."

673
00:48:21.026 --> 00:48:26.532
"All the birds of creation
sighed and cried

674
00:48:26.615 --> 00:48:32.871
when they heard the bell ring for
poor Robin!"

675
00:48:40.003 --> 00:48:41.630
Everything will be fine.

676
00:48:46.844 --> 00:48:49.137
OK.  Which one is it?

677
00:48:49.221 --> 00:48:50.722
The red one.

678
00:48:54.393 --> 00:48:55.394
Goodbye.

679
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:08.365
Hello Johanna.

680
00:49:11.076 --> 00:49:13.078
I am Petra's father.

681
00:49:13.954 --> 00:49:17.040
She told me a lot about you.

682
00:49:19.918 --> 00:49:22.254
I know what you're doing to her.

683
00:49:22.588 --> 00:49:26.258
And if you do it again
you know what I'll do?

684
00:49:27.926 --> 00:49:29.595
I will punish you.

685
00:49:30.762 --> 00:49:35.809
And if you tell an adult
what I have just said...

686
00:49:37.144 --> 00:49:38.812
she will not believe you.

687
00:49:39.188 --> 00:49:41.773
Because I am a great person.

688
00:49:44.026 --> 00:49:45.360
But you have to believe me.

689
00:49:45.861 --> 00:49:47.404
I will punish you.

690
00:49:50.991 --> 00:49:52.451
Remember, Johanna,

691
00:49:54.703 --> 00:49:57.497
God is watching all of us.

692
00:50:12.721 --> 00:50:14.348
Are they in the music room?

693
00:50:14.431 --> 00:50:15.432
Yes.

694
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.809
No.

695
00:50:59.393 --> 00:51:00.394
Hello.

696
00:51:02.563 --> 00:51:04.231
I'm sorry, master.

697
00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:06.024
We were not sure if you would come.

698
00:51:06.108 --> 00:51:08.944
We were told that
there was a scheduling conflict.

699
00:51:09.653 --> 00:51:11.405
Do you want me to take notes?

700
00:51:11.488 --> 00:51:14.283
No, thank you Sebastian.
It will not be necessary.

701
00:51:14.366 --> 00:51:15.993
Do we have our evaluation forms?

702
00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:17.703
We have reduced them to three.

703
00:51:18.203 --> 00:51:21.790
Let's come number one, unless,
someone has another topic to discuss.

704
00:52:39.618 --> 00:52:42.079
Goossens stands up, gives his best.

705
00:52:42.162 --> 00:52:45.040
And of course Leon was famous

706
00:52:45.123 --> 00:52:48.627
for its great vibrato, right?

707
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:52.840
Beecham looks up and says:
"Gentlemen, vote."

708
00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:56.885
How is the writing going?

709
00:52:58.303 --> 00:53:00.973
I never know how to respond to that.

710
00:53:02.224 --> 00:53:04.685
It gives the impression that it is
it is a physical act.

711
00:53:04.768 --> 00:53:06.687
How does the bowel movement go?

712
00:53:08.605 --> 00:53:11.567
OK.  How is the reflection?

713
00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.527
Yes, not too good.

714
00:53:14.027 --> 00:53:16.655
I hear things and
am euphoric, but

715
00:53:16.738 --> 00:53:19.867
I find myself in
a persiflage.

716
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.245
Everything is pastiche.

717
00:53:24.121 --> 00:53:27.040
We all have the same musical grammar.

718
00:53:27.124 --> 00:53:29.626
Take a look at Beethoven's Fifth.

719
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:32.921
The theme of the third movement
has the same interval sequence as

720
00:53:33.005 --> 00:53:36.425
the opening theme of the last
movement of Mozart's Fortieth.

721
00:53:36.508 --> 00:53:38.343
Maybe it was a coincidence.

722
00:53:38.427 --> 00:53:40.721
No.  Not in this case.

723
00:53:40.804 --> 00:53:43.307
If you want to use the
notebooks used

724
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:47.519
examine, the
29 measures of Mozart's finale,

725
00:53:47.603 --> 00:53:49.646
copied from Beethoven.

726
00:53:50.147 --> 00:53:53.692
Oh my God.  The
I find extremely depressing.

727
00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:58.030
I finished reading your manuscript.
That's great, Lydia.

728
00:53:58.113 --> 00:54:00.240
A classic.

729
00:54:00.324 --> 00:54:03.702
It will be available long after
my book is forgotten.

730
00:54:03.785 --> 00:54:05.245
Yes, you are right.

731
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:08.790
The first impression will
always be available.

732
00:54:08.874 --> 00:54:10.834
Too modest, as usual.

733
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.470
Thank you Andris.

734
00:54:22.888 --> 00:54:24.431
I will appreciate that.

735
00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:25.974
You can use it.

736
00:54:26.975 --> 00:54:28.977
A summary for the covers.

737
00:54:31.647 --> 00:54:33.190
Thank you very much.

738
00:54:33.273 --> 00:54:35.067
I'll send it to the editor.

739
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.777
Hopefully there is still time.

740
00:54:37.319 --> 00:54:39.613
I am proud to call you
my student

741
00:54:39.696 --> 00:54:41.949
even though I could teach you
I could not teach you anything.

742
00:54:42.032 --> 00:54:43.492
It is not true.

743
00:54:43.575 --> 00:54:46.578
Without you I would not have
this position here.

744
00:54:46.662 --> 00:54:49.373
They would be in London, New York.

745
00:54:49.456 --> 00:54:50.958
It is not Berlin.

746
00:54:52.417 --> 00:54:55.796
And I'm not sure what Sharon
would do if we had to leave.

747
00:54:55.879 --> 00:54:57.714
She is so close to her family.

748
00:54:57.798 --> 00:55:01.134
Yes. The Goodnow Sisters.

749
00:55:01.218 --> 00:55:03.679
The first one was a
real pain in the ass,

750
00:55:03.762 --> 00:55:06.098
while he still
had power at DG.

751
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:10.811
Heike is a woman
with many opinions.

752
00:55:10.894 --> 00:55:11.895
And this voice.

753
00:55:11.979 --> 00:55:15.148
The signal-to-noise ratio
is unbearable.

754
00:55:15.941 --> 00:55:19.653
I had to hide in my old house to write.
house to write.

755
00:55:20.612 --> 00:55:24.324
Schopenhauer measured the intelligence of a
by his sensitivity to noise.

756
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:30.289
Didn't he also throw a woman down the stairs
down the stairs who was chasing him?

757
00:55:30.372 --> 00:55:31.665
Yes.

758
00:55:31.748 --> 00:55:34.960
Although not sure
is whether this private and

759
00:55:35.043 --> 00:55:36.962
personal fall in
his work is relevant.

760
00:55:45.304 --> 00:55:46.388
You are late.

761
00:55:49.057 --> 00:55:50.434
- Give me your stick.
- Thank you very much.

762
00:55:50.517 --> 00:55:51.476
That's good.

763
00:59:54.094 --> 00:59:56.221
But it's also...

764
00:59:56.305 --> 01:00:00.642
It's as if we heard it from very,
very far away.  That's how it is...

765
01:00:06.815 --> 01:00:07.816
We are sorry.

766
01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:15.490
Harald, could you do a quick
installation for us?

767
01:00:51.276 --> 01:00:53.946
The same is needed behind the scenes
needed for the live recording.

768
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:55.948
One, two, one.

769
01:01:24.893 --> 01:01:27.688
Sounds great, but we
need to hear it.

770
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:28.772
OK?  It's not...

771
01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:03.307
It is much too slow.

772
01:02:21.992 --> 01:02:24.620
- How do you like it here?
- Good.

773
01:02:24.703 --> 01:02:29.249
Excellent, but it's a shame,
not to record directly to the hard disk.

774
01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:31.752
Criminal, to be more precise.

775
01:02:33.086 --> 01:02:34.713
Will you send me the MP3s?

776
01:02:34.796 --> 01:02:36.840
Sure.  But you don't want the WAVs?

777
01:02:36.924 --> 01:02:40.177
No, just what the
people will stream.

778
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.096
- And the video?
- Yes.  Camera A left of the stage.

779
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.723
- OK.
- OK.  Thanks guys.

780
01:02:44.806 --> 01:02:46.850
- OK.  Goodbye.  You're welcome.
- Goodbye.

781
01:02:50.479 --> 01:02:52.481
Do you want it louder here?

782
01:02:52.564 --> 01:02:56.443
Here it is not good because the
dominant dynamic is strong.

783
01:02:59.029 --> 01:03:01.448
A little something, maestro.

784
01:03:01.532 --> 01:03:07.412
During the Scherzo
the clarinet solo is still too loud.

785
01:03:07.496 --> 01:03:11.542
It should be an accompaniment figure
for the 1st violins.

786
01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:15.587
But otherwise I would
say that everything is going very well.

787
01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:17.714
Thank you Sebastian.

788
01:03:18.257 --> 01:03:19.341
Thank you very much.

789
01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:27.099
Accurate assessment?

790
01:03:27.808 --> 01:03:29.184
I don't think so.

791
01:03:29.268 --> 01:03:32.104
The clarinet is marked piano
and we are pianissimo.

792
01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:34.314
Sebastian likes to sit
likes to be in the orchestra.

793
01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:37.568
But no problem with the
sound balance on the balcony.

794
01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:44.366
A little more playful.

795
01:03:50.539 --> 01:03:53.750
That's what Tanya and I did with
Gustavo.  It is very powerful.

796
01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:56.253
Yes, great work, Karl.

797
01:03:56.336 --> 01:04:00.048
We could do a little less
try ... studied.

798
01:04:03.719 --> 01:04:05.888
Something so simple?

799
01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:09.933
I do not know how you
want to illuminate it.

800
01:04:10.017 --> 01:04:12.603
Tell Harald to
to dim the light halfway.

801
01:04:13.854 --> 01:04:15.939
Room lighting dimmed to half.

802
01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:23.447
It can work if
we bring in more light.

803
01:04:28.493 --> 01:04:30.245
If you want something like that,

804
01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:33.624
We need to bring in next week
bring in the bulbs.

805
01:04:33.707 --> 01:04:35.083
Leave out the lightning bolts.

806
01:04:37.669 --> 01:04:39.296
Thanks for waiting.

807
01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:40.881
Of course, master.

808
01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:43.926
What are your impressions
from today's rehearsal?

809
01:04:44.009 --> 01:04:49.306
Sebastian finds your solo
in the scherzo a bit strong.

810
01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.642
It is possible.

811
01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:53.143
I do not agree.

812
01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:56.522
Their dynamic indications
are higher than those of the 1st violin.

813
01:04:56.605 --> 01:04:58.065
Yes, it is true.

814
01:04:58.899 --> 01:05:02.569
Sebastian is getting old, Knut.

815
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.571
I will replace it.

816
01:05:05.781 --> 01:05:07.282
You are the first to know.

817
01:05:11.203 --> 01:05:12.204
Fountain...

818
01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:18.252
In this case I will organize a meeting
and we will coordinate.

819
01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:20.128
No. You won't.

820
01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:23.757
There must be a vote.

821
01:05:23.841 --> 01:05:26.426
I know the electoral conclave well.

822
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:28.387
But the appointment
of the assistant conductor

823
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.722
is my decision alone.

824
01:05:33.684 --> 01:05:37.062
Can I count on your support
from others?

825
01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:41.525
Good.

826
01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:43.569
Who will you replace him with?

827
01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:45.028
I am thinking about a few
names, but the

828
01:05:45.112 --> 01:05:48.198
The most important thing is to
to take care of it immediately.

829
01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:49.741
I understand.

830
01:05:50.576 --> 01:05:53.203
Maestro, the others
musicians want to know if

831
01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:55.205
you have decided in favor of the
have decided.

832
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:58.959
Soon, Knut, I promise you.

833
01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:30.157
How are you.

834
01:06:57.601 --> 01:07:03.065
I change from major to minor

835
01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:08.570
Sorry, I knocked.

836
01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:13.200
I knew you wanted
your keys back quickly.

837
01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:14.910
Yes thanks.

838
01:07:14.993 --> 01:07:16.537
Have you used the
company card used?

839
01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:20.791
We can use it for your cab
home.

840
01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:27.965
Yes. How are you.  You can go.

841
01:07:30.884 --> 01:07:33.428
It wasn't just the keys.

842
01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:39.184
I need someone to hug me.

843
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.814
This is not the place, Francesca.

844
01:07:45.274 --> 01:07:48.861
You are... it's not...

845
01:07:48.944 --> 01:07:50.320
I just came...

846
01:07:51.321 --> 01:07:54.533
I just received this from
someone at L'Accordéon.

847
01:08:06.753 --> 01:08:08.213
Oh no.

848
01:08:10.757 --> 01:08:12.092
When did it arrive?

849
01:08:12.176 --> 01:08:13.927
Day before yesterday.

850
01:08:15.888 --> 01:08:19.265
This e-mail she sent you
looks like it's already ...

851
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:21.602
Delete it.  And the rest.

852
01:08:22.769 --> 01:08:25.564
There is no reason to get
action to get stuck.

853
01:08:34.323 --> 01:08:38.493
Let's go.  There was nothing
could have done anything about it.

854
01:08:39.203 --> 01:08:40.871
She was not one of us.

855
01:08:57.304 --> 01:09:00.849
I keep thinking about
our trip to Ucayali.

856
01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:04.435
We were so close, the three of us.

857
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.356
But that was before she had
had any demands.

858
01:09:08.941 --> 01:09:13.612
There was something wrong with her.

859
01:09:14.446 --> 01:09:16.990
She had so much potential.

860
01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:18.533
It's true.

861
01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:19.826
Yes.

862
01:09:20.577 --> 01:09:22.578
Almost as much as you.

863
01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:29.920
Now we have to forget about it.

864
01:09:33.924 --> 01:09:35.425
You understand?

865
01:09:40.721 --> 01:09:42.015
OK?

866
01:09:45.102 --> 01:09:46.103
I am sorry.

867
01:09:46.812 --> 01:09:48.479
I know you're working.

868
01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:50.649
Your...

869
01:09:51.233 --> 01:09:53.527
Your keys are on the kitchen table.

870
01:10:10.252 --> 01:10:12.254
... STAY AWAY FROM MISS TAYLOR.

871
01:10:12.337 --> 01:10:14.590
...A DISTURBED
AND UNSTABLE WOMAN.

872
01:10:14.673 --> 01:10:17.092
...KRISTA TAYLOR IS
NOT SPECIFIED AT ALL...

873
01:10:19.219 --> 01:10:21.221
I CAN NOT RECOMMEND

874
01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:22.931
HIS STRANGE BEHAVIOR.

875
01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:24.850
NOT SPECIFIED AT ALL

876
01:10:27.978 --> 01:10:29.688
I MUST WARN YOU

877
01:10:29.771 --> 01:10:31.023
DANGER

878
01:10:31.106 --> 01:10:32.900
TO YOUR ORCHESTRA

879
01:10:58.425 --> 01:11:00.344
She immediately fell asleep.

880
01:11:03.263 --> 01:11:05.307
I did not have to
foot not hold.

881
01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:13.565
And she came home
home in a much better mood.

882
01:11:13.649 --> 01:11:14.858
Very well behaved.

883
01:11:25.118 --> 01:11:26.995
I met the new cellist.

884
01:11:27.788 --> 01:11:29.414
How was it?

885
01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:32.918
Olga Metkina.  Russian.

886
01:11:33.752 --> 01:11:35.003
An experienced musician.

887
01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:36.755
Good.

888
01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.676
His facial pose is a bit exaggerated.

889
01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:42.845
What?

890
01:11:42.928 --> 01:11:46.682
Its legato.
It looks like it's about to come.

891
01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:52.771
She is young.

892
01:11:53.522 --> 01:11:55.065
So you've met them.

893
01:11:59.319 --> 01:12:03.323
Francesca talked about it.
She organizes a welcome dinner.

894
01:12:06.285 --> 01:12:08.287
You should move that.

895
01:12:09.371 --> 01:12:11.540
His invitation is conditional.

896
01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:16.879
Do you have reservations?

897
01:12:19.548 --> 01:12:20.549
Not really.

898
01:12:22.134 --> 01:12:24.052
We need to see if it's a good fit.

899
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:29.975
Did you take your stamp?

900
01:12:34.438 --> 01:12:36.315
Thank you for reminding me.

901
01:14:04.444 --> 01:14:06.655
How was Johanna yesterday?

902
01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:08.866
She doesn't come near me anymore.

903
01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:11.285
Good.  Let me know if that changes.

904
01:14:15.122 --> 01:14:18.333
Didn't you come to my office
you didn't come to my office?

905
01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:20.711
No, Lydia.

906
01:14:20.794 --> 01:14:23.630
Because you know that you should not
be there without me.

907
01:14:23.714 --> 01:14:24.965
I say.

908
01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.594
That's it.

909
01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:07.799
It's not that simple.
It has to be... more confusing.

910
01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:23.607
A lot of pressure.

911
01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:30.364
Very familiar to all.

912
01:15:30.447 --> 01:15:32.950
It doesn't help you to know this
know this piece so well.

913
01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:36.078
Same place.

914
01:16:05.816 --> 01:16:09.570
Please.

915
01:16:09.653 --> 01:16:11.405
You have to watch.

916
01:16:18.036 --> 01:16:22.416
It must be like a person who
sings with her heart for joy!

917
01:16:47.858 --> 01:16:48.859
Maestro!

918
01:16:49.651 --> 01:16:52.362
What a surprise!  I was just about to go out for dinner.

919
01:16:52.446 --> 01:16:55.449
- Can I get you anything?
- No thanks.

920
01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:58.243
- Tea perhaps?
- No, thank you, Sebastian.

921
01:16:59.244 --> 01:17:03.790
Sometimes I forget how
impressive your collection is.

922
01:17:03.874 --> 01:17:06.001
Is that Kalinnikov?

923
01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:09.713
Isn't it wonderful?

924
01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:12.966
Its place is in a museum.

925
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:18.013
I bought it in 1990 for 100 rubles
at a fair in Kiev.

926
01:17:18.096 --> 01:17:19.890
Immediately after the fall of the Wall.

927
01:17:20.474 --> 01:17:22.476
It must have been truly amazing.

928
01:17:23.268 --> 01:17:25.604
Amazing to have experienced this.

929
01:17:25.687 --> 01:17:28.774
I had just arrived here with
Andris arrived here,

930
01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:31.151
and suddenly
the impossible became possible.

931
01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:36.782
That's what I want to talk about.

932
01:17:36.865 --> 01:17:38.116
Reunification?

933
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.118
No. But sit
please sit down.

934
01:17:42.412 --> 01:17:47.084
About the possibility that you
conduct a subscription orchestra.

935
01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:48.961
But I do.

936
01:17:49.044 --> 01:17:51.338
Yes, but not as a bandleader.

937
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:56.009
If not now,
when, Sebastian?

938
01:17:57.678 --> 01:17:59.388
You mean leave Berlin?

939
01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:01.974
Go somewhere else, yes.

940
01:18:02.516 --> 01:18:04.226
But this is my home.

941
01:18:04.852 --> 01:18:07.980
Our only home is the podium.

942
01:18:08.063 --> 01:18:10.357
We all live with a suitcase in our hands.

943
01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.693
You know it as well as anyone.

944
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.242
Thinking.

945
01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:23.078
Take your time.

946
01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:26.832
We do not have to
not decide.

947
01:18:29.793 --> 01:18:31.545
It's the girl, huh?

948
01:18:31.628 --> 01:18:32.963
Sorry, what girl?

949
01:18:33.964 --> 01:18:35.591
You don't ask.

950
01:18:35.674 --> 01:18:36.925
You say.

951
01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:42.222
I knew as soon as she arrived
that my days were numbered.

952
01:18:42.306 --> 01:18:45.767
Andris told me not to worry.
I should not worry, but I knew.

953
01:18:46.727 --> 01:18:50.147
I don't know what you're talking about.

954
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:51.690
Oh stop.

955
01:18:51.773 --> 01:18:53.609
Only because no one dares to say it.

956
01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:55.861
We know what you do.

957
01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:58.739
The little favors you give.

958
01:18:58.822 --> 01:19:00.073
I am...

959
01:19:00.157 --> 01:19:03.577
I don't know what to say, Sebastian.

960
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:08.165
Do you have the audacity to question
to question my integrity?

961
01:19:08.248 --> 01:19:11.251
No. I'm sorry, master.
I do not know what I am saying.

962
01:19:11.335 --> 01:19:14.421
No. Obviously you know
you know very well what you are saying.

963
01:19:14.505 --> 01:19:16.423
If that's what you think of me,

964
01:19:16.507 --> 01:19:19.635
don't you think staying here
is completely unthinkable?

965
01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:21.845
No, please, maestro.
Excuse me.

966
01:19:21.929 --> 01:19:22.930
Why this one?

967
01:19:23.013 --> 01:19:26.683
Your obsequiousness, your hypocrisy
hypocrisy, your misogyny?

968
01:19:26.767 --> 01:19:27.851
I am not a misogynist!

969
01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:29.686
Misogamy.

970
01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.730
It is the hatred of marriage.

971
01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:36.902
Andris still has a very strong marriage.

972
01:19:37.945 --> 01:19:42.199
And you occupy an
Apartment on the same floor.

973
01:19:42.908 --> 01:19:46.078
I don't like what he's implying.

974
01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:50.082
It could be more than
nasty rumors.

975
01:19:50.165 --> 01:19:51.291
I say.

976
01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:55.420
We barely survived the mirror
survived when we came out of the closet.

977
01:19:57.381 --> 01:20:01.426
But with Francesca
no one can say anything.

978
01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:04.263
It's not like you were together.

979
01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:06.849
Yes, it's true.  I have just...

980
01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:10.602
It turns me on to think that the old
robot will be right about something.

981
01:20:12.479 --> 01:20:15.190
He has probably seen Andris before.

982
01:20:18.402 --> 01:20:21.822
Is there anyone other than
Francesca who is more qualified?

983
01:20:25.033 --> 01:20:27.452
There are others who have the
have the same ability.

984
01:20:32.249 --> 01:20:34.084
Wait to decide.

985
01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:45.929
Where do we stand with DG?

986
01:20:46.013 --> 01:20:48.807
I spoke with an assistant in
Boyd Muir's office who said,

987
01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:53.687
that he does not know why he chose
a digital version.

988
01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:56.148
What are the criteria.

989
01:20:56.231 --> 01:20:59.276
But they have pressed for Long
Yu a whole CD.

990
01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:02.696
Sure.  The Chinese
market is amazing.

991
01:21:03.238 --> 01:21:06.867
Good.  No more kid gloves.
I will see Lucian.

992
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:10.495
Perhaps he should remember his
Anneberg inclusion initiative.

993
01:21:11.538 --> 01:21:13.624
Do you have contact information?

994
01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:16.084
I'll send it to you.

995
01:21:18.212 --> 01:21:20.797
My machine has derailed again.

996
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:23.509
I have already spoken with IT.

997
01:21:23.592 --> 01:21:25.260
Let me borrow yours.

998
01:21:32.726 --> 01:21:33.810
Thank you very much.

999
01:21:37.689 --> 01:21:39.066
Where is the matcha?

1000
01:21:58.794 --> 01:22:01.046
NO ORCHESTRA HAS OFFERED ME
OFFERED ME A PLACE!

1001
01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:08.846
I CAN NO LONGER BE THAT PERSON
NO LONGER BE

1002
01:22:08.929 --> 01:22:10.931
I HAVE NO FUTURE NOW

1003
01:22:24.403 --> 01:22:26.363
I didn't know where you were.

1004
01:22:26.446 --> 01:22:28.365
I trained to take the strain off a muscle.

1005
01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:30.534
The matcha is cold.

1006
01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:33.745
How are you.  I don't need it.
Let's get back to work.

1007
01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:43.380
Francesca, you did
done what I wanted,

1008
01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:46.967
and all correspondence
with Krista deleted.

1009
01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:48.051
Exactly?

1010
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:53.390
I am not sure.

1011
01:22:55.517 --> 01:22:57.561
I will check.

1012
01:23:05.652 --> 01:23:07.905
You know, Sebastian is leaving.

1013
01:23:08.572 --> 01:23:13.911
Could you create a list
of possible replacements?

1014
01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:22.252
Of course you are welcome to
add your own name.

1015
01:23:25.297 --> 01:23:26.507
Thank you very much.

1016
01:23:29.593 --> 01:23:32.596
Your lunch with
the new cellist.

1017
01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:37.267
I wanted to postpone the meeting after the
Orchestra's voices.

1018
01:23:37.351 --> 01:23:39.102
I write to him.

1019
01:23:41.063 --> 01:23:42.272
No wait.

1020
01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.983
Might as well see what she has in her stomach.

1021
01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.078
This food.

1022
01:23:58.372 --> 01:24:01.083
The cucumber salad is very good.

1023
01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:06.129
It is the only option
here if you are vegetarian.

1024
01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:08.465
Do you eat fish?

1025
01:24:08.549 --> 01:24:09.675
Not really.

1026
01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.764
We can go somewhere else.

1027
01:24:15.848 --> 01:24:17.808
Like Store Kitchen.

1028
01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:20.978
It's a silly tradition,
but new members will come here

1029
01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:25.232
brought to dine with the spirits
of the past.

1030
01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.362
Everyone from Napoleon to Beethoven

1031
01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:32.614
has eaten at one of these
tables eaten.

1032
01:24:32.698 --> 01:24:34.992
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1033
01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:37.244
I wonder which ones.

1034
01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:40.038
Who is this?  A musician?

1035
01:24:40.122 --> 01:24:45.043
No. She helped to found the social democratic women's
women's movement in Germany.

1036
01:24:45.127 --> 01:24:50.674
And the KDP, until Hitler was in power
was in power, it was banned from the USSR.

1037
01:24:51.175 --> 01:24:52.551
Clara Zetkin.

1038
01:24:53.927 --> 01:24:58.432
On March 8, flowers will be laid on his memorial plaque
in the necropolis of the Kremlin wall.

1039
01:24:59.099 --> 01:25:00.267
On his birthday?

1040
01:25:00.767 --> 01:25:02.853
No, International Women's Day.

1041
01:25:06.273 --> 01:25:07.774
Are you ready, Maestro?

1042
01:25:08.942 --> 01:25:13.071
- Yes.
- The shish kebab, then the veal.

1043
01:25:14.072 --> 01:25:15.115
For you?

1044
01:25:15.866 --> 01:25:17.242
The cucumber salad.  Thank you very much.

1045
01:25:17.326 --> 01:25:18.410
Good choice.

1046
01:25:21.205 --> 01:25:22.456
More bread?

1047
01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:31.924
That's good.  Do you want something?

1048
01:25:32.633 --> 01:25:35.177
Oh, no.  Thank you very much.

1049
01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:38.514
Have you lived in Berlin for a long time?

1050
01:25:38.597 --> 01:25:40.432
Not at all.

1051
01:25:40.516 --> 01:25:44.353
Until the decision of the
orchestra with friends in Neukölln.

1052
01:25:45.687 --> 01:25:47.397
Simonov will keep your place?

1053
01:25:47.481 --> 01:25:50.108
Yes, I think.  It is my uncle.

1054
01:25:52.694 --> 01:25:56.073
But I have always dreamed of
to play with the Berlin orchestra.

1055
01:25:56.156 --> 01:25:57.241
Me too.

1056
01:25:58.408 --> 01:26:00.077
There is no place like it.

1057
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:07.000
Rostropovich must be your hero?

1058
01:26:08.418 --> 01:26:10.587
Of course, he was fantastic.

1059
01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:13.799
We study it at the Moscow
Conservatory, but as

1060
01:26:13.882 --> 01:26:17.010
I was younger, my favorite was
Jacqueline du Pré was my favorite.

1061
01:26:17.094 --> 01:26:19.221
She made me
to play the cello.

1062
01:26:20.097 --> 01:26:21.098
Which disc was it?

1063
01:26:21.181 --> 01:26:23.725
No hard disk.  Youtube.

1064
01:26:23.809 --> 01:26:25.519
The Elgar Concerto.

1065
01:26:27.646 --> 01:26:31.108
Safe.  With Barenboim at the
London Philharmonic.

1066
01:26:31.608 --> 01:26:34.027
I don't know who was responsible.

1067
01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:37.322
But she touched me.

1068
01:26:37.406 --> 01:26:41.118
I decided to learn it and play
to play with the youth orchestra.

1069
01:26:41.702 --> 01:26:43.704
Holy challenge.  How old were you?

1070
01:26:43.787 --> 01:26:44.913
13 years.

1071
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.502
I would love to hear it.

1072
01:26:50.586 --> 01:26:53.213
You have made a video.  I will write to you.

1073
01:28:00.489 --> 01:28:03.242
My mother's diary, which is delivered...

1074
01:28:03.784 --> 01:28:06.119
is not there.  You have it?

1075
01:28:06.203 --> 01:28:07.287
No.

1076
01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:08.288
You are sure?

1077
01:28:09.414 --> 01:28:10.457
No, sorry.

1078
01:30:01.485 --> 01:30:02.736
Wonderful.

1079
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:16.083
Before we take a break
I know that you

1080
01:30:16.166 --> 01:30:21.296
wonder what the
Backing track will be,

1081
01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.799
and I have thought a lot about it
thinking and wondering,

1082
01:30:23.882 --> 01:30:26.718
whether we could conduct an informal
survey could be conducted

1083
01:30:26.802 --> 01:30:30.222
about the possibility,
the Fifth and the

1084
01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:32.057
Cello Concerto by Elgar
together?

1085
01:31:00.335 --> 01:31:02.754
Considering,
what we have all been through

1086
01:31:02.838 --> 01:31:04.631
and what we are
still go through,

1087
01:31:04.715 --> 01:31:08.635
and when we are finally
reunited as a family,

1088
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:15.142
I think the soloist
should come from us.

1089
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:22.107
- One more question.
- Go.

1090
01:31:22.191 --> 01:31:24.318
And this is for you, Gosia.

1091
01:31:24.401 --> 01:31:27.196
I mean, normally

1092
01:31:27.279 --> 01:31:30.949
it should be you.

1093
01:31:31.033 --> 01:31:33.952
But in view of that,
what we ask you with Mahler

1094
01:31:34.036 --> 01:31:38.040
would you mind
if we auditioned?

1095
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:50.177
It's unorthodox.

1096
01:31:53.555 --> 01:31:56.517
But theoretically I have no objections.

1097
01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.853
My only hesitation will depend on..,
when these auditions take place.

1098
01:31:59.937 --> 01:32:02.898
I do not want them to
disrupt our section rehearsals.

1099
01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:04.358
No. You are right.

1100
01:32:04.441 --> 01:32:07.486
We have to hurry.

1101
01:32:10.697 --> 01:32:12.366
What do you think about Monday?

1102
01:32:16.495 --> 01:32:17.746
OK.

1103
01:32:21.917 --> 01:32:25.921
Good.  Knut, can you put together
a group for Monday?

1104
01:32:27.506 --> 01:32:28.757
And remember,

1105
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:31.385
all section members
are invited.

1106
01:32:40.936 --> 01:32:42.563
Let's see what she says.

1107
01:32:43.188 --> 01:32:44.815
OK I have to go.

1108
01:32:46.525 --> 01:32:47.985
Britta, hello.

1109
01:32:48.068 --> 01:32:50.696
Lydia.  I have seen the end.

1110
01:32:51.196 --> 01:32:53.073
What do you think?

1111
01:32:53.156 --> 01:32:54.825
It is fantastic.

1112
01:32:55.534 --> 01:32:57.744
I can hardly wait
to hear the recording in public.

1113
01:32:57.828 --> 01:32:59.371
Yes, well, I'm glad,

1114
01:32:59.454 --> 01:33:01.623
when it is over.

1115
01:33:01.707 --> 01:33:03.041
This is always the case.

1116
01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:06.837
You are busy
and I would like

1117
01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.921
not make your work too
difficult, but...

1118
01:33:09.047 --> 01:33:11.175
Andris Davis called.

1119
01:33:11.258 --> 01:33:14.761
He is annoyed that
I'm replacing Sebastian.

1120
01:33:14.845 --> 01:33:16.972
No no.  That is another thing.

1121
01:33:17.055 --> 01:33:18.140
But let
Laura know when

1122
01:33:18.223 --> 01:33:19.892
you have selected your
selected.

1123
01:33:19.975 --> 01:33:21.393
prepare a press release
to prepare.

1124
01:33:21.476 --> 01:33:22.895
Yes, of course.

1125
01:33:23.478 --> 01:33:24.771
So what did he want?

1126
01:33:24.855 --> 01:33:26.481
To worry about the
punctuality of a

1127
01:33:26.565 --> 01:33:27.941
driver complains, he thinks

1128
01:33:28.025 --> 01:33:30.068
were provided by the committee.

1129
01:33:30.152 --> 01:33:32.196
Are you aware of this?

1130
01:33:32.279 --> 01:33:33.405
Yes.

1131
01:33:33.947 --> 01:33:36.617
No, it's just...
Something I'm paying for.

1132
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.660
Why does he think that
it's the committee?

1133
01:33:39.536 --> 01:33:41.622
Because he has to believe in it.

1134
01:33:42.497 --> 01:33:44.291
He must believe...

1135
01:33:44.374 --> 01:33:47.044
He must believe that he has not been forgotten.

1136
01:33:47.127 --> 01:33:49.838
On the academy is engraved
Karajan's name engraved,

1137
01:33:49.922 --> 01:33:52.424
and everywhere there are
shrines to Abbado's glory.

1138
01:33:52.508 --> 01:33:54.384
But the name Davis

1139
01:33:54.468 --> 01:33:56.762
we do not see anywhere.

1140
01:33:56.845 --> 01:33:58.305
OK.

1141
01:33:58.388 --> 01:33:59.848
So maybe Francesca

1142
01:33:59.932 --> 01:34:01.975
could talk to the driver?

1143
01:34:02.059 --> 01:34:03.227
Sure.

1144
01:34:04.478 --> 01:34:06.188
Something different.

1145
01:34:06.271 --> 01:34:07.439
It's unfortunate.

1146
01:34:08.273 --> 01:34:10.817
Oh yeah? Budget overrun?

1147
01:34:11.735 --> 01:34:13.904
Would you like me and Mrs. Sewing
for a drink?

1148
01:34:13.987 --> 01:34:15.822
No.  Nothing to do with the orchestra.

1149
01:34:15.906 --> 01:34:18.367
Do you remember a
L'Accordéon scholarship holder?

1150
01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:20.202
named Krista Taylor?

1151
01:34:23.747 --> 01:34:25.958
Yes. Why that one?

1152
01:34:26.041 --> 01:34:28.085
Apparently, she committed suicide.

1153
01:34:29.044 --> 01:34:30.838
Oh, dear God.  The poor.

1154
01:34:31.922 --> 01:34:33.131
Their parents must ...

1155
01:34:34.842 --> 01:34:36.844
Wait, sorry, I...

1156
01:34:36.927 --> 01:34:38.011
I don't understand.

1157
01:34:38.095 --> 01:34:41.306
Why were you asked to deliver this
to deliver this terrible news?

1158
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:43.600
Why has L'Accordéon
not contacted me?

1159
01:34:43.684 --> 01:34:45.394
It's difficult, Lydia.

1160
01:34:45.477 --> 01:34:47.020
Mr. Kaplan thinks you should

1161
01:34:47.104 --> 01:34:48.230
contact a lawyer

1162
01:34:48.313 --> 01:34:50.566
before you talk to someone
at L'Accordéon.

1163
01:34:51.191 --> 01:34:52.234
I assume

1164
01:34:52.317 --> 01:34:54.361
than anyone else, including Eliot himself.

1165
01:34:56.321 --> 01:34:58.699
I... I'm sorry,
why would I do that?

1166
01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:01.368
It appears that charges have been filed.

1167
01:35:01.451 --> 01:35:03.704


1168
 --> 
 

1169
01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:09.543
He didn't say.

1170
01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:11.920
They were communicated to the
Accordion Council.

1171
01:35:12.004 --> 01:35:14.673
Mr. Kaplan said he was
sure that there was nothing

1172
01:35:14.756 --> 01:35:16.884
will come out, but one cannot be
can't be too careful.

1173
01:35:36.028 --> 01:35:38.488
I'm sorry to call so late.
Lydia Tár speaks.

1174
01:35:38.572 --> 01:35:40.866
I need to speak with Mr. Singer right away.

1175
01:35:41.825 --> 01:35:44.036
Yes, it's urgent.

1176
01:36:14.066 --> 01:36:15.067
Tired?

1177
01:36:19.696 --> 01:36:20.906
I sleep badly.

1178
01:36:22.449 --> 01:36:24.868
I felt the same way before
I felt the same way before an appointment.

1179
01:36:26.828 --> 01:36:27.829
Lydia,

1180
01:36:29.498 --> 01:36:31.834
Are you sure about your decision for Sebastian?

1181
01:36:34.837 --> 01:36:36.338
Who will you replace him with?

1182
01:36:37.756 --> 01:36:39.508
Maybe Andrew Crust.

1183
01:36:40.968 --> 01:36:43.679
He was Otto Tausk's assistant at the VSO.

1184
01:36:44.429 --> 01:36:45.597
Not the girl?

1185
01:36:55.941 --> 01:36:57.192
Andreas ...

1186
01:37:00.988 --> 01:37:06.743
Have you ever had a problem
with a student or colleague,

1187
01:37:06.827 --> 01:37:09.037
Who misinterpreted your intent?

1188
01:37:09.121 --> 01:37:11.415
- Did anyone complain about me?
- Of course not.

1189
01:37:11.498 --> 01:37:13.458
At this point, they missed their chance.

1190
01:37:13.542 --> 01:37:16.962
- I'm out of the race.
- Sure.

1191
01:37:17.588 --> 01:37:22.092
Thank God I was never taken off the podium like
Jimmy Levine off the podium.

1192
01:37:22.176 --> 01:37:24.678
Or hunted like Charles Dutoit.

1193
01:37:25.262 --> 01:37:27.514
Why this question?

1194
01:37:28.265 --> 01:37:32.352
There have been so many stories
stories about it in the news.

1195
01:37:32.436 --> 01:37:35.522
Being accused is
like being guilty today.

1196
01:37:36.523 --> 01:37:40.777
But that was also the case
years ago with Furtwängler as well.

1197
01:37:41.653 --> 01:37:43.780
A little bit also with Karajan.

1198
01:37:47.409 --> 01:37:48.952
Who was the best?

1199
01:37:50.787 --> 01:37:52.623
I have never played under the direction
by Furtwängler.

1200
01:37:53.373 --> 01:37:56.335
When I came here
the oldest members...

1201
01:37:57.544 --> 01:37:59.546
had secret opinions.

1202
01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:02.883
And they wanted to
they wanted to leave behind.

1203
01:38:02.966 --> 01:38:05.385
- What?  The war?
- No, after the war.

1204
01:38:05.469 --> 01:38:07.262
Denazification.

1205
01:38:07.763 --> 01:38:11.892
If someone accuses you,
the process starts all over again.

1206
01:38:11.975 --> 01:38:14.144
Furtwängler never joined the party.

1207
01:38:14.228 --> 01:38:17.981
He refused to take the salute
or to lead the "Horst Wessel Song".

1208
01:38:18.065 --> 01:38:20.567
Or to sign his letters with "Heil Hitler".

1209
01:38:20.651 --> 01:38:22.653
Also the ones he wrote to Hitler.

1210
01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:27.157
But he had to be denazified.

1211
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.619
By then he was
partially retired,

1212
01:38:31.411 --> 01:38:33.121
he played for corpses.

1213
01:38:34.331 --> 01:38:36.166
He played for corpses?

1214
01:38:36.792 --> 01:38:39.461
He played secretly in a cemetery.

1215
01:38:41.755 --> 01:38:45.634
You equate sexual misconduct
with being accused of being a Nazi?

1216
01:38:46.885 --> 01:38:48.720
In any case, you had to be ready.

1217
01:38:48.804 --> 01:38:53.517
For years I was as
careful as possible.

1218
01:39:04.361 --> 01:39:07.281
How many are auditioning on Monday?

1219
01:39:11.618 --> 01:39:13.036
None.

1220
01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:14.872
None?

1221
01:39:16.957 --> 01:39:18.333
Maybe Martin.

1222
01:39:20.002 --> 01:39:23.964
He never got along with Gosia.
He would like to be the center of attention.

1223
01:39:28.177 --> 01:39:29.928
He still has to audition.

1224
01:39:32.472 --> 01:39:33.765
Sure.

1225
01:39:34.516 --> 01:39:36.226
He must abide by the rules.

1226
01:39:38.979 --> 01:39:40.939
Are we not too solemn?

1227
01:39:41.023 --> 01:39:43.692
As far as I know, there is
only one musician, right?

1228
01:39:43.775 --> 01:39:45.736
No, Maestro, there are two.

1229
01:40:48.841 --> 01:40:50.551
Well, it's unanimous.

1230
01:40:50.634 --> 01:40:51.885
Number two.

1231
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:54.721
And we have a problem.

1232
01:40:54.805 --> 01:40:58.016
She was not officially invited,
to be a member of the orchestra.

1233
01:40:59.476 --> 01:41:02.354
She does not have to
play solo for us.

1234
01:41:03.188 --> 01:41:05.065
The criterion for
the audition

1235
01:41:05.148 --> 01:41:07.651
was all members of the section?

1236
01:41:08.527 --> 01:41:10.571
- Then his hearing is eliminated.
- Nope.

1237
01:41:10.654 --> 01:41:14.157
Francesca, call Martin
and let him know.

1238
01:41:14.241 --> 01:41:16.702
Hold on.  Gosia, we need to talk.

1239
01:41:27.504 --> 01:41:30.424
I will confirm solo show dates
confirm with her.

1240
01:41:30.507 --> 01:41:31.550
Thank you very much.

1241
01:41:32.593 --> 01:41:33.802
Sit down.

1242
01:41:39.516 --> 01:41:41.101
I have opted for the replacement

1243
01:41:41.185 --> 01:41:43.520
decided by Sebastian.

1244
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:46.690
I want you to know,

1245
01:41:46.773 --> 01:41:48.483
that it was not easy.

1246
01:41:50.444 --> 01:41:52.571
The position is associated with enormous

1247
01:41:52.654 --> 01:41:54.823
Responsibility connected

1248
01:41:54.907 --> 01:41:57.784
Apart from my
affection for you, must

1249
01:41:57.868 --> 01:42:01.872
I would choose someone with
more experience.

1250
01:43:02.891 --> 01:43:05.978
Leave me alone.
I don't have your diary!

1251
01:43:07.354 --> 01:43:08.647
I've already told you, I...

1252
01:43:09.982 --> 01:43:11.733
Oh I'm sorry.  Come in!

1253
01:43:58.197 --> 01:43:59.531
Good!  Good!

1254
01:43:59.615 --> 01:44:01.491
I find the contrast...

1255
01:44:01.575 --> 01:44:03.535
much better, don't you think?

1256
01:44:04.453 --> 01:44:05.954
How do you drink your coffee?

1257
01:44:06.038 --> 01:44:07.831
Black.  Strong.

1258
01:44:10.042 --> 01:44:11.627
Is it okay if I play?

1259
01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:13.670
Oh yes of course.

1260
01:45:02.761 --> 01:45:04.096
That's as far as I went.

1261
01:45:05.222 --> 01:45:06.598
But it is good.

1262
01:45:08.016 --> 01:45:09.393
This part here...

1263
01:45:13.772 --> 01:45:15.858
If we replace the C
is replaced by a B?

1264
01:45:19.862 --> 01:45:21.738
It is better.  I like this sound.

1265
01:45:23.991 --> 01:45:26.076
Come.  Take a break.

1266
01:45:40.757 --> 01:45:41.758
Sharon.

1267
01:45:48.724 --> 01:45:51.143
Sharon went out with her sister.

1268
01:45:52.019 --> 01:45:54.021
The way they whispered,

1269
01:45:54.104 --> 01:45:57.024
that doesn't sound good to me.

1270
01:45:57.107 --> 01:45:59.026
The child is in his room.

1271
01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.281
Peter.

1272
01:46:30.974 --> 01:46:32.601
What are you doing here?

1273
01:46:32.684 --> 01:46:35.062
I hide from her.

1274
01:46:35.938 --> 01:46:37.189
Why this one?

1275
01:46:37.272 --> 01:46:42.861
Because she told me to put my
Put my things away, but they are.

1276
01:46:46.365 --> 01:46:47.616
I can see that.

1277
01:46:48.909 --> 01:46:50.494
Come.

1278
01:46:50.577 --> 01:46:52.412
They are all waiting for you.

1279
01:46:52.496 --> 01:46:56.291
I will give everyone a pencil.

1280
01:46:56.375 --> 01:46:58.794
All of them? You can't lead them all.

1281
01:46:58.877 --> 01:47:01.630
It is not a democracy.

1282
01:48:15.954 --> 01:48:17.873
Hey, that's good.

1283
01:48:17.956 --> 01:48:18.957
You are happy?

1284
01:48:20.042 --> 01:48:22.503
The glissandi worked very well.

1285
01:48:23.253 --> 01:48:26.215
How long have you been with
Miss Taylor together?

1286
01:48:27.424 --> 01:48:30.552
I will check with my
Assistant,

1287
01:48:30.636 --> 01:48:34.598
but by accumulating everything
accumulate, a few months.

1288
01:48:35.974 --> 01:48:38.227
- Thank you master.
- You are welcome.

1289
01:48:39.603 --> 01:48:41.980
This recording
remains on a storage medium

1290
01:48:42.064 --> 01:48:44.066
Professional secret protected
server at Mr. Singer.

1291
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:45.150
Perfect.

1292
01:48:45.234 --> 01:48:47.611
He will get in touch with you to
Help you prepare for the deposition.

1293
01:48:51.365 --> 01:48:52.491
The deposition?

1294
01:48:53.575 --> 01:48:56.328
Yes. I assumed that you knew that.

1295
01:48:56.954 --> 01:49:00.415
Mr. Singer's office says they have
with your assistant.

1296
01:49:00.958 --> 01:49:04.419
Francesca, get your pretty little
little ass to work right now.

1297
01:49:06.588 --> 01:49:08.674
The only message we got
we got from Francesca,

1298
01:49:08.757 --> 01:49:10.968
was an e-mail to my
assistant in the middle of the night.

1299
01:49:11.051 --> 01:49:12.553
submits his immediate resignation.

1300
01:49:12.636 --> 01:49:16.348
She said she would contact her when she had more details.
when she had more details.

1301
01:49:17.099 --> 01:49:18.392
What details?

1302
01:49:18.475 --> 01:49:20.143
A new address, I suppose.

1303
01:49:20.227 --> 01:49:22.145
In the meantime we have been trying all morning

1304
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:24.857
to find someone who
help you temporarily.

1305
01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:28.318
At the moment your new
Assistant Conductor would be fine.

1306
01:49:28.402 --> 01:49:31.154
No. It is not
available until the fifth.

1307
01:49:31.238 --> 01:49:32.698
Yes, I am ready.  Let's go.

1308
01:49:37.119 --> 01:49:39.037
I know how much you trusted him.

1309
01:49:39.121 --> 01:49:40.664
Little bitch with two faces.

1310
01:49:40.747 --> 01:49:42.040
Imagine how much pain she is in.

1311
01:49:42.124 --> 01:49:44.585
- Don't defend them.
- Damn, slow down!

1312
01:49:44.668 --> 01:49:46.295
She will come back at a gallop.

1313
01:49:46.378 --> 01:49:48.505
I have a stupid
phone like all robots.

1314
01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:50.340
Sending text messages is not witchcraft.

1315
01:49:51.633 --> 01:49:54.511
Slow down!  Or leave me hanging!

1316
01:50:16.283 --> 01:50:17.451
Francesca.

1317
01:50:54.196 --> 01:50:55.531
You invade.

1318
01:51:42.411 --> 01:51:43.537
Quickly!

1319
01:52:12.191 --> 01:52:13.692
We need to transfer it.

1320
01:52:15.819 --> 01:52:17.487
We need to transfer it

1321
01:52:18.864 --> 01:52:20.616
...everything will be fine, miss.

1322
01:52:20.699 --> 01:52:21.575
Not the hand!

1323
01:52:21.658 --> 01:52:22.826
Use the belt!

1324
01:53:21.593 --> 01:53:23.220
Sorry for being late again.

1325
01:53:30.143 --> 01:53:31.603
Do you live here?

1326
01:53:32.729 --> 01:53:34.231
Not usually, no.

1327
01:53:35.899 --> 01:53:38.026
Make yourself at home.
I will dress.

1328
01:53:38.110 --> 01:53:39.069
Do you have a towel?

1329
01:53:41.864 --> 01:53:42.990
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

1330
01:53:49.079 --> 01:53:50.581
I was surprised by the rain.

1331
01:54:03.177 --> 01:54:05.429
There will be a small concert
with musician friends.

1332
01:54:05.512 --> 01:54:06.680
You should come.

1333
01:54:08.015 --> 01:54:09.349
Thank you, but I...

1334
01:54:10.017 --> 01:54:11.602
really have to go home.

1335
01:54:11.685 --> 01:54:12.978
You have a child, don't you?

1336
01:54:14.605 --> 01:54:16.273
I will not do that.

1337
01:54:18.734 --> 01:54:20.444
Animals are better for some.

1338
01:54:35.584 --> 01:54:37.961
- Goodbye.
- Oh yes!  Goodbye, yes.  Goodbye.

1339
01:57:10.948 --> 01:57:12.991
Why didn't you go to the police?

1340
01:57:13.075 --> 01:57:15.953
I fought, he ran away.
What else can you say?

1341
01:57:19.581 --> 01:57:22.000
I give you something
for the pain.

1342
01:57:22.084 --> 01:57:25.045
- I do not need anything.
- I give you something.

1343
01:57:29.383 --> 01:57:31.176
Was someone mean to you?

1344
01:57:34.304 --> 01:57:37.766
You are the most beautiful
person I know.

1345
01:58:00.455 --> 01:58:01.790
What's going on?

1346
01:58:04.459 --> 01:58:06.336
Hold my foot.

1347
01:58:14.678 --> 01:58:16.263
It is better?

1348
01:58:16.346 --> 01:58:17.514
Yes.

1349
01:58:55.385 --> 01:58:56.803
Look at me

1350
01:59:01.266 --> 01:59:03.477
Let us eliminate this problem.

1351
01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:06.813
"What happened to his face?"

1352
01:59:07.648 --> 01:59:10.192
"Did she have her nose and eye redone?

1353
01:59:10.275 --> 01:59:12.653
and sped off before the
Surgeon was done with the other one?"

1354
01:59:18.325 --> 01:59:19.368
Nope,

1355
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:21.453
I was attacked.

1356
01:59:22.454 --> 01:59:23.830
Thank you very much.

1357
01:59:24.414 --> 01:59:26.208
I'm fine.  Really.

1358
01:59:26.291 --> 01:59:27.918
You should have seen the other one.

1359
01:59:28.001 --> 01:59:29.086
OK.

1360
02:00:14.464 --> 02:00:16.675
Stopped!  It burns.

1361
02:00:17.509 --> 02:00:19.261
You need to see a doctor.

1362
02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:21.555
He doesn't have an appointment
appointment until next week.

1363
02:00:21.638 --> 02:00:24.183
I call back and tell them,
how much pain you're in...

1364
02:00:24.266 --> 02:00:26.351
No, let's end this here.

1365
02:00:28.729 --> 02:00:30.898
The scale looks good.

1366
02:00:30.981 --> 02:00:34.568
Apart from a brief review
we should focus on the Elgar.

1367
02:00:35.485 --> 02:00:37.237
Are you sure?

1368
02:00:37.321 --> 02:00:39.323
I think.  Yes.

1369
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:41.742
There we are pretty
solid, but I

1370
02:00:41.825 --> 02:00:46.788
will try to keep them
hold back here.

1371
02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:50.501
You are impressed by the
Power of your Glissando

1372
02:00:50.584 --> 02:00:52.127
tied up and try to
to do the same.

1373
02:00:53.712 --> 02:00:55.339
It's probably...

1374
02:00:55.422 --> 02:00:57.799
Where were you attacked, maestro?

1375
02:00:59.343 --> 02:01:00.636
No matter.

1376
02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:02.679
Stop.

1377
02:01:04.056 --> 02:01:05.265
Thank you very much.

1378
02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:07.351
There you are.

1379
02:01:08.519 --> 02:01:09.978
When did this fall take place?

1380
02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:12.564
It's a blur in my mind.
Three, four days ago.

1381
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:16.527
It's just my shoulder.  Yes.  It burns.

1382
02:01:16.610 --> 02:01:18.737
As if I had fallen asleep
asleep by the pool.

1383
02:01:20.072 --> 02:01:22.991
OK, you can get dressed.

1384
02:01:23.075 --> 02:01:24.409
You have damaged nerves.

1385
02:01:24.493 --> 02:01:27.496
The burning sensation you have,
is called notalgia paresthetica.

1386
02:01:27.579 --> 02:01:28.830
Nostalgia?

1387
02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.791
Notalgia.  No S.

1388
02:01:31.291 --> 02:01:32.709
How is it treated?

1389
02:01:32.793 --> 02:01:35.254
You do nothing.
It will disappear eventually.

1390
02:01:35.337 --> 02:01:37.965
An adjustment would help.
Your spine is twisted.

1391
02:02:27.222 --> 02:02:31.768
They must be a Negro product,
exploited by the Jews.

1392
02:02:33.937 --> 02:02:36.815
Let's turn to the piano,

1393
02:02:36.899 --> 02:02:39.234
to a super sexy young woman!

1394
02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.154
It's... it was very good.

1395
02:02:42.237 --> 02:02:47.951
You can cum physically,
but what are you doing for me?

1396
02:02:53.707 --> 02:02:56.168
- Britta.
- Hi.  You have seen it?

1397
02:02:56.251 --> 02:02:58.128
Yes. I just saw him.

1398
02:02:58.212 --> 02:02:59.922
Meeting this afternoon.

1399
02:03:01.423 --> 02:03:03.300
- This afternoon?
- It is a problem?

1400
02:03:03.383 --> 02:03:05.260
No, no problem.

1401
02:03:40.379 --> 02:03:44.633
First, this course was given in an
area without tech objects given.

1402
02:03:44.716 --> 02:03:50.305
And whoever violated this rule
has violated what we have seen,

1403
02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:53.475
to create linguistic traps, to
create, to redefine my texts.

1404
02:03:53.559 --> 02:03:55.644
Look at the reverse
Student's shot.

1405
02:03:55.727 --> 02:03:58.981
This was not possible in real time.
It is an outline.

1406
02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:01.191
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

1407
02:04:01.275 --> 02:04:04.820
And if it was only this
video, we wouldn't be here.

1408
02:04:04.903 --> 02:04:07.656
Unfortunately, it's with a
article of the New York

1409
02:04:07.739 --> 02:04:09.241
Post about Krista Taylor's
Suicide linked,

1410
02:04:09.324 --> 02:04:13.954
alluding to other companions they say they have interviewed.
they say they have interviewed.

1411
02:04:14.037 --> 02:04:16.373
Laura, can you tell us about
about your conversations?

1412
02:04:16.456 --> 02:04:18.876
We had none.  We
have no answer to this

1413
02:04:18.959 --> 02:04:21.837
because we wanted to discuss the
wanted to discuss the strategy.

1414
02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.839
- Here is the article.
- Thank you Laura.

1415
02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:32.055
"Has many young women
to sexual acts for

1416
02:04:32.139 --> 02:04:34.975
professional favors
seduced and instigated.

1417
02:04:35.058 --> 02:04:37.603
Blocked opportunities for
Those who did not submit."

1418
02:04:37.686 --> 02:04:39.938
It is completely fictitious.

1419
02:04:40.022 --> 02:04:42.608
And the Post is an
ugly scandal sheet.

1420
02:04:42.691 --> 02:04:45.152
No serious person reads it.

1421
02:04:48.197 --> 02:04:50.949
And as for Krista Taylor,

1422
02:04:52.242 --> 02:04:55.370
she was disturbed.
She fixed me.

1423
02:04:55.454 --> 02:04:57.289
How?

1424
02:04:57.372 --> 02:05:00.667
She sent me strange gifts.
She harassed me on the Internet.

1425
02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:03.587
- She was trying to send me signals.
- What genre?

1426
02:05:03.670 --> 02:05:06.798
She destroyed my Wikipedia page,
to claim that she was my muse.

1427
02:05:06.882 --> 02:05:09.176
It's easy to check.

1428
02:05:09.259 --> 02:05:12.596
And did you report it or complain about it?

1429
02:05:14.264 --> 02:05:15.265
No.

1430
02:05:15.933 --> 02:05:18.727
No. And I should have.

1431
02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:21.104
I... I felt sorry for her.

1432
02:05:21.188 --> 02:05:24.691
- Did you tell Sharon about this?
- I didn't want to disturb him.

1433
02:05:24.775 --> 02:05:26.902
- Shouldn't you have?
- Yes!  Yes.

1434
02:05:26.985 --> 02:05:28.654
What do you advise?

1435
02:05:28.737 --> 02:05:31.114
So far, it has not received much
attention paid to it.

1436
02:05:31.198 --> 02:05:34.034
No magazine has quoted him or
invited to comment on him.

1437
02:05:34.117 --> 02:05:35.786
Let's wait and see what comes next.

1438
02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:40.082
We wanted to warn you, Lydia,

1439
02:05:41.041 --> 02:05:43.043
before the donor meeting
on Friday.

1440
02:05:43.126 --> 02:05:45.003
Unfortunately, I will not be there.

1441
02:05:45.087 --> 02:05:47.548
I advise you to go there.

1442
02:05:47.631 --> 02:05:51.718
Got the book launch in New York
got and apparently a statement.

1443
02:05:53.178 --> 02:05:56.014
In this case we will inform you
inform you after your return.

1444
02:05:58.767 --> 02:06:00.519
Have a nice weekend.

1445
02:06:02.604 --> 02:06:04.273
I am starving!

1446
02:06:04.898 --> 02:06:06.775
I finished my thing today.

1447
02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:09.361
Congratulations!  We should go celebrate.

1448
02:06:09.444 --> 02:06:10.487
Packing.

1449
02:06:11.572 --> 02:06:13.115
- Hi.
- Hello Lydia.

1450
02:06:22.958 --> 02:06:24.835
Did you see my score?

1451
02:06:24.918 --> 02:06:27.296
No. Why that?
She is not with the others?

1452
02:06:27.379 --> 02:06:28.797
No.

1453
02:06:29.423 --> 02:06:31.592
Are you sure she's
is not in my office?

1454
02:06:34.511 --> 02:06:36.930
And the orchestra library?

1455
02:06:38.682 --> 02:06:40.934
Can you check again?

1456
02:06:44.062 --> 02:06:45.981
I don't know!  Yes exactly.

1457
02:07:09.796 --> 02:07:11.632
When will you be back?

1458
02:07:12.633 --> 02:07:14.051
Day after tomorrow.

1459
02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:16.762
I promise?

1460
02:07:16.845 --> 02:07:18.472
Yes I promise.

1461
02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:31.235
- Good night.
- Good night.

1462
02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:48.377
Thank you very much.  Do you have bottles?

1463
02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.503
Sure.

1464
02:07:51.004 --> 02:07:53.715
Anything else before
I close the cabin door?

1465
02:07:53.799 --> 02:07:55.801
Yes. We are waiting for another person.

1466
02:08:02.933 --> 02:08:06.019
To all my
questions regarding your

1467
02:08:06.103 --> 02:08:08.689
Communication with
Krista Taylor and others,

1468
02:08:09.439 --> 02:08:11.441
Their answers were always

1469
02:08:11.525 --> 02:08:13.068
"I don't know"

1470
02:08:13.151 --> 02:08:15.737
or "I don't remember".

1471
02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:22.452
May I show you something
to jog your memory?

1472
02:08:22.995 --> 02:08:28.250
Documents such as e-mails from you or
from your assistant, Miss Lentini, that you have

1473
02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:31.795
would help you to remember,
what you said and what you didn't say?

1474
02:08:40.304 --> 02:08:42.097
You've heard it now.

1475
02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:44.725
Bryant Park moved you to 53rd Street.

1476
02:08:48.312 --> 02:08:50.856
Here is the statement
from the Kaplan Foundation.

1477
02:08:53.775 --> 02:08:56.403
I'm sorry, this is probably
the last time we will see each other.

1478
02:08:56.486 --> 02:08:58.697
I will be able to buy my
buy my own airline tickets.

1479
02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:03.160
Ask someone else to teach you
teach you how to crawl to the podium.

1480
02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:22.971
Is there a back entrance?

1481
02:09:24.014 --> 02:09:28.060
"The usual metaphors
for the explanation of music

1482
02:09:28.143 --> 02:09:32.523
are based on the idea
that music is a language,

1483
02:09:32.606 --> 02:09:34.483
nevertheless a secret language.

1484
02:09:35.859 --> 02:09:39.863
And so sacred and impenetrable.

1485
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:44.243
These happy
noises we make,

1486
02:09:44.326 --> 02:09:49.414
come closest to the divine
closest, but

1487
02:09:50.958 --> 02:09:51.959
something born...

1488
02:09:52.042 --> 02:09:53.752
HOW IS SHE

1489
02:09:53.836 --> 02:09:55.504
...through the simple movement of air.

1490
02:09:55.587 --> 02:09:57.339
TALK ABOUT THE DIVINITY I
DIE WHEN SHE USES ALLEGORY

1491
02:09:57.422 --> 02:10:00.300
is similar to a bird's song."

1492
02:10:09.476 --> 02:10:11.562
Dinner in half an hour?

1493
02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:14.648
Thank you, but I have jet lag.
I will go to sleep.

1494
02:10:14.731 --> 02:10:16.108
Yes, me too.  I go...

1495
02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:18.569
probably do the same.

1496
02:11:17.503 --> 02:11:19.087
Yes Hello

1497
02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:21.215
Yes, there is no water in my room.

1498
02:11:21.965 --> 02:11:23.550
Yes, I checked the minibar.

1499
02:11:24.218 --> 02:11:26.803
How long does it take until I
get a bottle of water?

1500
02:11:26.887 --> 02:11:28.514
Forget that.  I'm going downstairs.

1501
02:11:32.351 --> 02:11:33.894
Lobby, please.

1502
02:12:01.797 --> 02:12:03.048
Oh my God.

1503
02:12:16.436 --> 02:12:17.855
It was Britta.

1504
02:12:19.273 --> 02:12:20.607
Eh?

1505
02:12:21.316 --> 02:12:25.821
So you have heard the lies of
from all those robots.

1506
02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:28.615
I'm not interested in Juilliard history.

1507
02:12:28.699 --> 02:12:30.617
She has too much time to lose.

1508
02:12:30.701 --> 02:12:33.620
She is an extremist.  Of the worst kind.

1509
02:12:34.538 --> 02:12:38.584
As soon as I leave here,
she'll bring you rumors.

1510
02:12:38.667 --> 02:12:42.421
Or she asks me about other

1511
02:12:42.504 --> 02:12:43.881
unsubstantiated rumors
like Samantha Hankey.

1512
02:12:43.964 --> 02:12:47.384
An insignificant being who has
has nothing better to do than to work at

1513
02:12:47.467 --> 02:12:50.512
my name at a dinner party
and hinting at things.

1514
02:12:51.263 --> 02:12:53.056
I am sorry for you.

1515
02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:54.224
You can abstain.

1516
02:12:55.976 --> 02:12:57.895
I tried to call you last night.

1517
02:13:00.314 --> 02:13:01.940
Did you have fun with her?

1518
02:13:03.025 --> 02:13:06.028
My back hurts like hell.

1519
02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:09.948
Francesca left and I needed
someone to carry my luggage.

1520
02:13:10.032 --> 02:13:14.119
Who should I ask
to accompany me?  Knut?

1521
02:13:16.455 --> 02:13:19.249
I accept many things from you.

1522
02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:23.587
And at the end of the day
I could get over it.

1523
02:13:24.463 --> 02:13:27.257
But that's not the point, is it?

1524
02:13:29.718 --> 02:13:34.306
These accusations of the parents of the
Girl who committed suicide?

1525
02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:41.897
Do you really believe what they say?

1526
02:13:46.276 --> 02:13:47.277
These are lies.

1527
02:13:49.905 --> 02:13:53.617
Can you imagine,
what it was like to walk into my

1528
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:56.620
Department and see everyone
whispering about me?

1529
02:13:56.703 --> 02:14:01.041
It has nothing to do with
with what they're accusing you of.

1530
02:14:01.124 --> 02:14:06.547
It is the simple fact of not warning me
warn me that our family is in danger.

1531
02:14:07.506 --> 02:14:09.716
How would that have helped?

1532
02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:12.636
What could you have done
to make things better?

1533
02:14:15.097 --> 02:14:17.099
Because I deserve it.

1534
02:14:17.683 --> 02:14:19.476
These are the rules.

1535
02:14:20.644 --> 02:14:25.399
You have to ask me for advice, like you always did.
advice, like you always have.

1536
02:14:25.482 --> 02:14:27.359
Just like you did when you
here as a guest conductor

1537
02:14:27.442 --> 02:14:30.070
have come to look for a
seek permanent employment.

1538
02:14:30.153 --> 02:14:32.614
You asked me about
politics, about

1539
02:14:32.698 --> 02:14:35.409
Strategies on how we
could address this.

1540
02:14:38.203 --> 02:14:39.913
Of course, these conversations took place

1541
02:14:39.997 --> 02:14:42.666
takes place in another bed.

1542
02:14:43.667 --> 02:14:48.630
or on the couch in this terrible
place from which you can't separate yourself.

1543
02:14:48.714 --> 02:14:50.966
My old grief dwells within me.

1544
02:14:53.343 --> 02:14:57.181
How cruel to define our relationship
as a transaction.

1545
02:15:00.851 --> 02:15:04.188
Only one of your connections was not.

1546
02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:07.441
And she sleeps in the next room.

1547
02:15:08.025 --> 02:15:10.777
Apparently that did not
did not occur to you.

1548
02:17:28.207 --> 02:17:29.750
Come here, honey!

1549
02:17:32.335 --> 02:17:33.712
- It was good.
- Really?

1550
02:17:33.795 --> 02:17:35.379
- Yes.
- Do you want to go to the park?

1551
02:17:36.924 --> 02:17:39.050
TU not that.  You are welcome.

1552
02:17:39.134 --> 02:17:40.260
Please don't.

1553
02:18:06.827 --> 02:18:09.706
Hello, I am Anna Franzen.

1554
02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:12.166
This is my late mother's apartment.

1555
02:18:14.710 --> 02:18:16.922
Yes, I'm sorry to hear about your mother.

1556
02:18:17.004 --> 02:18:18.173
Thank you very much.

1557
02:18:19.341 --> 02:18:21.468
How is your sister?

1558
02:18:21.552 --> 02:18:24.346
Eleanor lives in a center in New Koelin.

1559
02:18:24.888 --> 02:18:26.598
Sorry to
the disturbance, but my

1560
02:18:26.682 --> 02:18:29.977
Husband and I sell
this apartment

1561
02:18:30.059 --> 02:18:33.313
and we listened to the music.

1562
02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:37.234
I'm glad you like it.

1563
02:18:37.316 --> 02:18:40.529
We were wondering if you
rehearse at certain times,

1564
02:18:40.611 --> 02:18:43.156
to organize visits the rest of the time
to be able to organize.

1565
02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:46.743
We do not want to
not scare off buyers

1566
02:18:47.744 --> 02:18:49.745
with all the noise.

1567
02:18:55.585 --> 02:18:57.838
No, of course not.

1568
02:19:11.101 --> 02:19:14.146
Apartment for sale!

1569
02:19:14.228 --> 02:19:17.232
Apartment for sale!

1570
02:19:17.316 --> 02:19:19.985
Your mother is buried

1571
02:19:20.067 --> 02:19:25.616
And now you will keep his
Keep apartment for sale!

1572
02:19:25.699 --> 02:19:27.743
Your sister is in prison!

1573
02:19:27.825 --> 02:19:30.995
You put your sister in prison!

1574
02:19:31.079 --> 02:19:33.290
You are all going to hell!

1575
02:19:33.373 --> 02:19:36.251
Your apartment is for sale!

1576
02:21:33.869 --> 02:21:35.245
Look at me

1577
02:21:40.375 --> 02:21:41.793
Keep going.  Look at me.

1578
02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:50.969
That's my score.

1579
02:21:51.929 --> 02:21:53.013
They are disturbed.

1580
02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:55.933
That's my score!

1581
02:21:56.016 --> 02:21:59.186
You damn little worm!

1582
02:22:07.778 --> 02:22:08.737
I am fine.

1583
02:22:38.392 --> 02:22:40.102
Your signed CAMI voucher.

1584
02:23:08.338 --> 02:23:10.757
Normally
Lisa Rich would be in the

1585
02:23:10.841 --> 02:23:12.384
Reservation department
ideal for you,

1586
02:23:12.467 --> 02:23:14.803
but she has too much to do.

1587
02:23:14.887 --> 02:23:18.307
So, I'd like you to meet
with Jake.

1588
02:23:18.390 --> 02:23:22.186
Jake, will you show Lydia what
you've prepared for her?

1589
02:23:22.269 --> 02:23:23.353
Fountain,

1590
02:23:24.730 --> 02:23:26.940
it is a reset.

1591
02:23:27.024 --> 02:23:28.817
What we are looking for is less, not more.

1592
02:23:28.901 --> 02:23:32.154
We want to be selective and
rebuild everything from the beginning.

1593
02:23:32.237 --> 02:23:33.947
We need a new story.

1594
02:23:38.702 --> 02:23:40.370
Only here.

1595
02:23:40.454 --> 02:23:41.747
Here, thanks.

1596
02:23:42.831 --> 02:23:45.083
From 40. Thank you.

1597
02:25:19.511 --> 02:25:21.263
You felt triumphant, right?

1598
02:25:25.058 --> 02:25:26.768
Now we can use the

1599
02:25:26.852 --> 02:25:28.896
Understanding the meaning of music.

1600
02:25:28.979 --> 02:25:31.231
This is what it feels like,

1601
02:25:31.315 --> 02:25:32.900
when you hear it.

1602
02:25:33.525 --> 02:25:35.694
In the end, we took this giant step.

1603
02:25:35.777 --> 02:25:38.780
And here we are.  We know
now what music means.

1604
02:25:38.864 --> 02:25:42.784
And we do not have to understand the "crosses
and the "quakes" not understand

1605
02:25:42.868 --> 02:25:46.371
and all this
mess to make the music

1606
02:25:46.455 --> 02:25:48.415
to understand when
she tells us something.

1607
02:25:49.082 --> 02:25:52.503
And the most beautiful thing is that
the different feelings,

1608
02:25:52.586 --> 02:25:56.632
that it awakens in you, there are no
limits are set.

1609
02:25:56.715 --> 02:26:00.552
Some of these feelings
are so unique and

1610
02:26:00.636 --> 02:26:03.222
deep that words cannot
cannot describe them.

1611
02:26:03.305 --> 02:26:05.474
We cannot always
name what we feel.

1612
02:26:05.557 --> 02:26:06.558
Sometimes we can.

1613
02:26:06.642 --> 02:26:10.479
We can say that we feel joy,
pleasure and peace.

1614
02:26:10.562 --> 02:26:12.105
Love-hate relationship.

1615
02:26:12.189 --> 02:26:14.483
But every now and then we have
we have feelings that are so unique

1616
02:26:14.566 --> 02:26:18.987
that we have no words to
have to describe them.

1617
02:26:19.071 --> 02:26:22.032
That is why the
music is so wonderful.

1618
02:26:22.115 --> 02:26:24.451
Because the music names them for

1619
02:26:24.535 --> 02:26:27.246
us, but in notes
instead of words.

1620
02:26:27.329 --> 02:26:28.997
Everything is in its movement.

1621
02:26:29.081 --> 02:26:31.625
You must never
forget that music

1622
02:26:31.708 --> 02:26:33.085
Movement is, it
is always going somewhere,

1623
02:26:33.168 --> 02:26:38.215
transforms, changes and
flows from one note to the next.

1624
02:26:38.298 --> 02:26:42.970
And this movement tells us more
about our feelings than a million words.

1625
02:26:43.053 --> 02:26:45.055
And now we'll play you a...

1626
02:26:59.278 --> 02:27:00.279
Toni.

1627
02:27:03.657 --> 02:27:04.908
Hello Linda.

1628
02:27:04.992 --> 02:27:06.159
We are sorry.

1629
02:27:06.243 --> 02:27:07.244
Lydia.

1630
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:10.289
Mom said you would come.

1631
02:27:10.998 --> 02:27:12.541
You have to hide.

1632
02:27:14.209 --> 02:27:16.003
Why should I hide?

1633
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:18.255
I have no idea.

1634
02:27:18.964 --> 02:27:20.966
It doesn't affect me anyway.

1635
02:27:22.426 --> 02:27:24.636
A lot of stuff without
explanation, you have to admit.

1636
02:27:26.471 --> 02:27:27.931
What do you mean?

1637
02:27:28.015 --> 02:27:30.142
As I said, it's none of my business.

1638
02:27:31.852 --> 02:27:35.230
But you don't seem to know
where you come from and where you are going.

1639
02:28:27.616 --> 02:28:29.159
I can go in?

1640
02:28:30.911 --> 02:28:33.497
Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.

1641
02:28:44.842 --> 02:28:46.176
I am sorry.

1642
02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:47.511
We just wanted to confirm,
that the composer is not

1643
02:28:47.594 --> 02:28:51.431
will come from Osaka to participate
participate in the concert.

1644
02:28:52.182 --> 02:28:56.812
I have searched in
music libraries for

1645
02:28:56.895 --> 02:28:59.231
searched for his notes,
but found nothing.

1646
02:28:59.314 --> 02:29:00.899
It just happened.

1647
02:29:01.608 --> 02:29:02.943
It is fantastic.  Thank you very much.

1648
02:29:05.279 --> 02:29:07.281
Shirley and Cirio
will gladly show you the

1649
02:29:07.364 --> 02:29:09.491
Sights
of our beautiful country.

1650
02:29:09.575 --> 02:29:11.451
Thank you very much!  Thank you very much.

1651
02:29:11.535 --> 02:29:12.995
Oh my God.

1652
02:29:13.662 --> 02:29:15.080
Thank you very much.

1653
02:29:46.612 --> 02:29:49.907
We could stop somewhere
stop to swim.

1654
02:29:50.657 --> 02:29:54.536
Yes, in the waterfall.
Not in the river.

1655
02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:57.039
Why this one?  Is there a problem with the water?
Problem with the water?

1656
02:29:57.122 --> 02:29:57.956
No.

1657
02:29:58.040 --> 02:29:59.416
There are crocodiles.

1658
02:30:02.002 --> 02:30:04.338
I did not expect to find them so
far from the sea.

1659
02:30:04.421 --> 02:30:05.422
They are from a movie

1660
02:30:05.506 --> 02:30:07.174
escaped with Marlon Brando.

1661
02:30:09.134 --> 02:30:11.094
It was a long time ago.

1662
02:30:11.929 --> 02:30:13.472
You survive.

1663
02:30:48.257 --> 02:30:49.299
Woman!  Woman!

1664
02:30:52.594 --> 02:30:54.847
Here is the order.  Ten dollars.

1665
02:30:54.930 --> 02:30:56.139
Thank you very much.

1666
02:30:57.766 --> 02:31:01.228
Are there any around here... Thank you.

1667
02:31:01.311 --> 02:31:03.272
Where can I get a massage?

1668
02:31:03.355 --> 02:31:06.608
I had hoped it would
help me against jet lag.

1669
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:11.280
Yes.

1670
02:31:11.363 --> 02:31:13.866
It is a very pleasant place.

1671
02:31:13.949 --> 02:31:15.117
Thank you very much.

1672
02:31:28.964 --> 02:31:30.174
Thank you very much.

1673
02:31:30.257 --> 02:31:32.009
Continue to the aquarium.

1674
02:31:32.092 --> 02:31:33.844
The aquarium?

1675
02:31:33.927 --> 02:31:35.387
Yes, over there.

1676
02:31:41.810 --> 02:31:44.563
Sorry, I do not understand.
How it works?

1677
02:31:45.647 --> 02:31:47.524
Here you select a number.

1678
02:31:49.651 --> 02:31:51.236
I dial a number?

1679
02:32:04.458 --> 02:32:05.709
Number five?

1680
02:32:49.628 --> 02:32:51.171
Hello.

1681
02:32:51.255 --> 02:32:52.381
Hello.

1682
02:32:52.464 --> 02:32:53.924
Before we begin, let
us a little about the

1683
02:32:54.007 --> 02:32:58.720
Intention of the composer
speak for this piece

1684
02:33:00.264 --> 02:33:02.224
and what she might be looking for.

1685
02:33:21.243 --> 02:33:22.411
Five minutes.

1686
02:33:54.735 --> 02:33:55.903
Thank you very much.

1687
02:34:20.761 --> 02:34:23.347
Sisters and
Brothers of the Fifth

1688
02:34:23.430 --> 02:34:24.598
Fleet, now is the
time has come.

1689
02:34:24.681 --> 02:34:27.184
My goodbyes will be short.

1690
02:34:27.267 --> 02:34:28.810
I've never been good with words.

1691
02:34:29.895 --> 02:34:31.688
When we board this boat,

1692
02:34:31.772 --> 02:34:33.273
a turnaround is not possible.

1693
02:34:34.107 --> 02:34:35.984
The next land your feet

1694
02:34:36.068 --> 02:34:38.403
will enter, will be
be the New World.

1695
02:34:40.864 --> 02:34:42.783
If any of you lack the courage,

1696
02:34:42.866 --> 02:34:46.495
step aside now and don't let
not be judged by anyone.

1697
