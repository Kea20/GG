GERTRUDE:
I can make that story go away...

251

I think your brother's
up to something.

252

No, I just decided
to let you guys

253

have all the fun
sucking up to Mom today.

254

Please. You are King Suck-up.

257
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.096
Alva, you named
your son Bertrude.

258
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:11.065
Okay.

259
00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.000
Sorry, Bert,
but that's not a real name.

260
00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:15.537
Sorry, Linda. We can't all be
lucky enough to have daughters.

261
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.771
Mom, I can hear you.

262
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.275
You know something we don't.
What is it?

263
00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:23.043
No, I don't. I don't.

264
00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:24.245
I got it. Bingo.

265
00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:25.412
I'm onto you, man. Come on!

my favorite granddaughter?

-Well, that makes her
sound like a whore. -Okay.

the meaning of the word.

00:45:06.173 --> 00:45:09.743
Pick Jason.
He's my mom's favorite.

895
00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:11.745
-Yep. Him.
-The one in the sweater.

896
00:45:11.779 --> 00:45:14.215
All right.
Jason Lightstone it is.

897
00:45:14.248 --> 00:45:15.416
-The number one son.
-No.

898
00:45:15.449 --> 00:45:16.884
Wait, wait, wait.
No, we don't need...

899
00:45:16.917 --> 00:45:18.219
We don't need to do that.
No, it's okay.

900
00:45:18.252 --> 00:45:20.354
No. No, no, no.
We don't need to do this.

901
00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:21.523
No. No, no, no, no.

Don't... No. -(muttering)

00:45:25.527 --> 00:45:27.494

no one hired a Santa.

All right, all right,
all right. You're right.

911
00:45:41.008 --> 00:45:42.042
You're right.
Let's stop it. Let's stop it.

912
00:45:42.076 --> 00:45:44.144
What are we doing here? Come on.

913
00:45:44.178 --> 00:45:47.181
What are we, amateurs?
We're half-assing this.

914
00:45:47.214 --> 00:45:50.351
Come on. It's not called
a finger cracker.

915
00:45:51.519 --> 00:45:53.420
Okay, Candy Cane.

916
00:45:53.454 --> 00:45:54.922

919

scoop out brains before.

to scoop his brains out,

right now,

922

923
00:46:03.565 --> 00:46:05.032

924
00:46:05.065 --> 00:46:06.534

926
00:46:08.102 --> 00:46:10.404

00:46:41.969 --> 00:46:43.538
He wasn't asking you.

945
00:46:43.571 --> 00:46:46.106
She's playing make-believe.

946
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.442
She's pretending
to talk to Santa.

947
00:46:48.475 --> 00:46:50.444

Santa's my friend,

1017
00:50:38.272 --> 00:50:40.173
Yeah.

00:50:40.207 --> 00:50:42.342

I remember, um...

1028
00:51:14.141 --> 00:51:15.843
when Trudy Lightstone
wrote to me.

1029
00:51:15.877 --> 00:51:18.378
She must have been
about six years old,

1030
00:51:18.412 --> 00:51:22.249
and she said that
she felt lonely sometimes.

1031
00:51:22.282 --> 00:51:24.586
She missed having a best friend.

1032
00:51:24.619 --> 00:51:25.853
And so I brought her

1033
00:51:25.887 --> 00:51:27.755
a beautiful little
stuffed rabbit.

1034
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:29.256
Mr. Bunny.

1035
00:51:29.289 --> 00:51:31.258
And then I remember
the next year,

1036
00:51:31.291 --> 00:51:33.327
and you said you had
this amazing dream

1037
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.364
and that, afterwards,
all you wanted to do was...

1038
00:51:37.397 --> 00:51:38.733
To fly!

1039
00:51:38.766 --> 00:51:41.168
(laughing):
To fly. To fly.

1040
00:51:42.369 --> 00:51:46.708
I mean, Santa might have
some magic, but...

1041
00:51:46.741 --> 00:51:50.511
making a little girl fly?

1042
00:51:52.647 --> 00:51:56.818
But giving you a kite,

1043
00:51:56.851 --> 00:52:00.253
floating just beneath
the clouds,

1044
00:52:00.287 --> 00:52:02.890
well, it's about
as good as it gets.

1045
00:52:02.924 --> 00:52:04.826
I knew it.

1046
00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:07.361
I knew you were real, Santa.

1047
00:52:09.931 --> 00:52:13.133
Don't be too hard
on your parents, all right?

1048
00:52:14.702 --> 00:52:17.605
Grown-ups have a hard time
believing things.

1049
00:52:18.438 --> 00:52:20.808

1050
00:52:20.842 --> 00:52:23.176
to make them
love each other again?

1051
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:25.546
I wish I had that kind of power.

1052
00:52:26.514 --> 00:52:30.183
Mrs. Claus and I have been
going on year, uh,

1053
00:52:30.217 --> 00:52:32.486
1,100, and...

1054
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.256
Grown-up relationships
are complicated.

1055
00:52:36.924 --> 00:52:39.259
It takes work.

1056
00:52:39.292 --> 00:52:41.395
A lot of work.

1057
00:52:43.631 --> 00:52:45.767
Do you still love her?

1058
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.669
Yeah, I do.

1059
00:52:48.736 --> 00:52:52.305
And sometimes, even if you want
to make somebody happy...

1060
00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.710
...the magic just goes away.

1061
00:52:57.745 --> 00:52:59.947
Hey.

1062
00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:01.816
I've got an idea.

1063
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:03.551
This will be fun.

1064
00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:07.722
Why don't you guys
open your presents?

1065
00:53:07.755 --> 00:53:12.325
I want to see what you
rich assholes get each other.

1066
00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:17.965
And some of you might not
make it till tomorrow morning,

1067
00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:21.201
so this could be
your only chance.

1247

1249

1251

Christmas dreams are bullshit.

1252
01:02:38.859 --> 01:02:41.128
My father used to make
a big deal out of it

1253
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:42.963
every Christmas.

1254
01:02:42.997 --> 01:02:45.065
Every freaking Christmas
with the presents

1255
01:02:45.099 --> 01:02:47.268
and the candy
and the decorations

1256
01:02:47.301 --> 01:02:51.138
and the Christmas caroling
and all that bullshit.

1257
01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:54.808

1258
01:02:54.842 --> 01:02:58.145
I don't know, ten, 11,

1259
01:02:58.178 --> 01:03:00.281
he got laid off,
and that Christmas,

1260
01:03:00.314 --> 01:03:01.516
couldn't even afford a tree.

1261
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:03.317
No Christmas dinner, no gifts.

1262

1267
01:03:14.194 --> 01:03:18.098
So Christmas Eve
rolls around, and...

1268
01:03:18.132 --> 01:03:21.168
I waited for everybody
to go to bed.

1269
01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:24.805
And then I snuck in there
to take it all.

1270
01:03:25.939 --> 01:03:28.042
Only problem was that
the gramps got up to take a piss

1271
01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:30.444
and the two of us scared
the shit out of each other.

1272
01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:33.447
And, um, he fell down the stairs

1273
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.052
and-and broke his neck,
and he died in the hospital.

1274
01:03:38.085 --> 01:03:39.587
Everybody thought that I did it,

1275
01:03:39.621 --> 01:03:41.322
and every time
I tried to tell them,

1276
01:03:41.355 --> 01:03:43.824
I tried to tell them that...

1277
01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:47.461
Anyway, maybe I did do it.

1278
01:03:47.494 --> 01:03:49.496

1279

1280
01:03:51.498 --> 01:03:54.902
So, you see,
Christmas ruined my life.

1281
01:03:54.935 --> 01:03:56.470
Okay? But you know what?

1282
01:03:56.504 --> 01:03:57.938
It set me on the path

1283
01:03:57.971 --> 01:03:59.973
and made me the great man
that I am today.

1284
01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:02.042
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1285
