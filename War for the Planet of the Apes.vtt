1
00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:57.740
Captain!

2
00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:40.658
Is that a trench?

3
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:44.245
It looks like there's
more of them inside.

4
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.294
Echo 2-6 to command.

5
00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.297
Colonel, we've got eyes on
three Kong in the north woods.

6
00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:55.506
One of them is armed.

7
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.150
And our donkey just
spotted another trench.

8
00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:58.634
Maybe the base is near.

9
00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:00.970
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.600
Yes, sir, copy.
Over.

11
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:12.315
Hey, donkey.

12
00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.195
Preacher.

13
00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:25.494
The one with the gun.

14
00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:29.123
As soon as the gunner's down,
you guys take out the trench.

15
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.291
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

16
00:04:50.394 --> 00:04:51.394
Fire!

17
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:00.154
Come on!

18
00:06:21.402 --> 00:06:22.611
Reload!

19
00:07:18.793 --> 00:07:20.795
Fall back! Fall back!

20
00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:45.486
Colonel, do you copy?
Colonel!

21
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:46.695
<i>Who is this?</i>

22
00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:48.197
Preacher, sir!
It's Preacher!

23
00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:50.324
<i>Where are you, soldier?
I need your position.</i>

24
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:52.701
I don't know!
<i>What do you see?</i>

25
00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:54.245
I can't see anything, sir.

26
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:56.497
We lost a lot of men,
and the captain is dead, sir.

27
00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:58.749
<i>Okay, calm down.
You're in command now.</i>

28
00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:00.668
Command, sir?

29
00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:02.545
I think it's just me
all by myself now.

30
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:04.046
<i>Take control.</i>

31
00:08:07.216 --> 00:08:09.510
Colonel, I don't think
I'm gonna make it, sir.

32
00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:10.719
I'm sorry.

33
00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:12.012
I'm so sorry, sir.

34
00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:15.099
<i>Listen to me.
You kill as many as you can.</i>

35
00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:22.064
No! No, no!

36
00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:39.516
Sixty-three dead.

37
00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:46.022
You're him.

38
00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:48.108
You're Caesar.

39
00:09:49.777 --> 00:09:51.779
We've been searching
for you for so long.

40
00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:54.448
We heard you had
a hidden command base.

41
00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:56.325
But we could never find it.

42
00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:58.786
Some of us started to think
that you might be dead.

43
00:09:58.953 --> 00:10:00.931
But Colonel McCullough said
you were out here somewhere.

44
00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.665
- Just kill us already.
- Shut up, man!

45
00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:04.667
What? They're animals.

46
00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:06.794
He's gonna slaughter us.

47
00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:17.846
I did not start this war.

48
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.518
The ape who did is dead.

49
00:10:23.978 --> 00:10:26.313
His name was Koba.

50
00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:28.565
I killed him.

51
00:10:30.526 --> 00:10:33.696
Now, I fight only...

52
00:10:33.862 --> 00:10:35.406
to protect apes.

53
00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:36.699
Yeah?

54
00:10:39.034 --> 00:10:40.035
What about him?

55
00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:42.997
We've got 10 more
just like him.

56
00:10:43.998 --> 00:10:45.916
I know these apes.

57
00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:49.169
They follow Koba.

58
00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:52.381
They tried to kill me.

59
00:10:53.048 --> 00:10:56.218
They fear
what I will do to them.

60
00:10:56.385 --> 00:11:00.014
So now, they serve you.

61
00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:02.224
Just to survive.

62
00:11:04.727 --> 00:11:07.479
I don't fear you.

63
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.403
You must fear.

64
00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:19.241
How long you think
woods can protect you?

65
00:11:19.408 --> 00:11:22.244
Humans destroy you.

66
00:11:23.412 --> 00:11:27.416
Their Kerna has all power.

67
00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:32.212
For them,
he more than just human.

68
00:11:34.715 --> 00:11:36.383
He everything.

69
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:40.471
He say: first Caesar die...

70
00:11:41.764 --> 00:11:45.184
then all of you die.

71
00:11:52.316 --> 00:11:54.526
Winter! Take this traitor outside!

72
00:12:01.992 --> 00:12:04.828
What should we do with the humans?

73
00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:19.968
You're letting us go?

74
00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:24.014
Tell your Colonel
you have seen me now...

75
00:12:24.807 --> 00:12:27.267
and I have a message for him.

76
00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:31.647
Leave us the woods,
and the killing can stop.

77
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.077
Do you think they will
give him the message?

78
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.162
They are the message,
Maurice.

79
00:12:48.372 --> 00:12:50.999
He will see
we are not savages.

80
00:12:59.049 --> 00:13:02.386
The traitor attacked me! He got away!

81
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.873
Koba...

82
00:13:31.665 --> 00:13:33.208
still haunts us.

83
00:13:35.544 --> 00:13:37.713
Why didn't I see...

84
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.134
that he could not forgive
what humans did to him?

85
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.806
No one could have known
how much darkness...

86
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.934
...was living inside him.

87
00:14:25.385 --> 00:14:27.679
Father...!

88
00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:44.821
Welcome home, Rocket.

89
00:14:44.988 --> 00:14:47.241
You look tired.

90
00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:49.451
It was a long journey.

91
00:14:49.826 --> 00:14:52.204
Father, we found something!

92
00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:53.622
Come.

93
00:15:20.566 --> 00:15:21.817
Mother...!

94
00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:31.660
Cornelius...

95
00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:34.121
Say hi to your brother!

96
00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:45.257
Look who's here, son...

97
00:15:56.101 --> 00:15:58.437
Lake...

98
00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:29.718
This is it, father...

99
00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:32.220
We can start over... A new home.

100
00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:35.974
What is beyond those mountains, son?

101
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.101
Show them, Rocket...

102
00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:52.074
A desert!

103
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:54.743
The journey is long...

104
00:16:55.243 --> 00:16:57.579
But that is why humans will not find us.

105
00:16:58.121 --> 00:17:00.749
We must leave tonight!

106
00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:03.460
Tonight? That's impossible!

107
00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:05.087
How long can we wait, Lake?

108
00:17:05.253 --> 00:17:07.130
Soldiers getting closer!

109
00:17:07.422 --> 00:17:08.422
Winter...

110
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.685
Your son's been gone, Caesar...

111
00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:24.106
He doesn't know how hard it's been.

112
00:17:27.067 --> 00:17:29.528
I know you are scared...

113
00:17:30.404 --> 00:17:32.322
We all are...

114
00:17:32.864 --> 00:17:35.826
But we are still planning...

115
00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:39.579
Yes.

116
00:17:40.497 --> 00:17:43.959
We must find a safe way
out of the woods.

117
00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:47.170
There were only two of you.

118
00:17:47.337 --> 00:17:50.590
But we are... many.

119
00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:04.938
We will find a way
out of here.

120
00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:10.152
Apes together...

121
00:18:11.528 --> 00:18:13.029
strong.

122
00:19:22.474 --> 00:19:23.558
Stay here, son!

123
00:19:23.683 --> 00:19:25.977
Protect your mother and brother!

124
00:20:10.522 --> 00:20:11.815
Caesar! What's wrong?!

125
00:20:12.607 --> 00:20:13.692
How many on patrol?

126
00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:15.568
Five? Six?

127
00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:16.903
Get them!

128
00:20:16.987 --> 00:20:19.614
Luca, get Rocket, too.

129
00:21:12.292 --> 00:21:14.336
Lima four to command.
Colonel, did you...

130
00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:25.680
Rocket!

131
00:21:25.847 --> 00:21:27.223
What happened?

132
00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:29.893
I heard him talking! The Colonel is here!

133
00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:34.022
<i>99, target acquired.</i>

134
00:21:34.731 --> 00:21:39.361
<i>99, target acquired. Repeat.
King Kong is dead.</i>

135
00:21:39.527 --> 00:21:42.489
<i>Let's go.
I can get out from here.</i>

136
00:23:48.907 --> 00:23:50.408
Caesar...

137
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.452
We can't find Winter!

138
00:23:55.246 --> 00:23:59.042
He was scared! I think he betrayed us!

139
00:24:03.421 --> 00:24:06.424
Have you found Cornelius yet?

140
00:24:07.842 --> 00:24:10.095
We're still searching.

141
00:24:14.682 --> 00:24:17.685
Let's go look for Caesar's little son.

142
00:24:51.427 --> 00:24:53.054
Cornelius!

143
00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:03.565
You're safe now.

144
00:25:21.791 --> 00:25:22.959
Lake...

145
00:25:24.043 --> 00:25:25.461
You loved my son.

146
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:30.258
Look after his brother
until I return.

147
00:25:35.346 --> 00:25:38.850
You're not coming with us to our new home?

148
00:25:38.933 --> 00:25:40.059
No.

149
00:25:44.647 --> 00:25:46.149
Go with Lake.

150
00:26:02.582 --> 00:26:03.875
Caesar!

151
00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:06.127
You're not going after them?!

152
00:26:08.254 --> 00:26:10.173
Not them. Him.

153
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:14.385
Caesar, you are our leader!

154
00:26:14.969 --> 00:26:16.930
We can't leave without you!

155
00:26:17.513 --> 00:26:18.848
You must.

156
00:26:20.141 --> 00:26:22.310
The soldiers
will be back soon.

157
00:26:22.477 --> 00:26:24.687
Father!

158
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.482
When I find him...

159
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:29.525
the soldiers will
all come after me.

160
00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:32.737
That may give you
the best chance

161
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.197
to get out of the woods.

162
00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:39.702
Where is he going?!

163
00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:46.501
Caesar! Caesar!

164
00:27:35.717 --> 00:27:38.469
The soldiers' camp is always moving.

165
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.847
My guards think they know where it is.

166
00:27:41.097 --> 00:27:42.348
Let me take you.

167
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.976
You need me to back you up!

168
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:46.936
No.

169
00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:49.689
Please...

170
00:27:50.398 --> 00:27:53.234
I know what it's like...

171
00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:55.236
...to lose a son.

172
00:27:56.279 --> 00:28:00.033
I may not make it back.

173
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.495
That's why I'm coming.

174
00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:09.083
To make sure you do.

175
00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:47.997
Guards think soldiers here...

176
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:50.666
Always fires burning.

177
00:29:04.097 --> 00:29:05.640
No one here...

178
00:29:06.307 --> 00:29:08.017
Search the area.

179
00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:33.626
I'm just gonna
put this down.

180
00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:09.996
What's he doing out here alone?

181
00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:12.290
Maybe he's a deserter?

182
00:31:25.238 --> 00:31:26.656
Look around.

183
00:31:30.117 --> 00:31:31.744
Take what you can.

184
00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:27.526
Something wrong with her.

185
00:33:27.693 --> 00:33:29.153
I don't think she can speak.

186
00:33:31.697 --> 00:33:32.907
Come.

187
00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:55.846
She'll die out here alone.

188
00:33:56.597 --> 00:33:58.391
We cannot take her, Maurice.

189
00:34:03.229 --> 00:34:05.106
I understand...

190
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:08.776
But I cannot leave her.

191
00:35:17.803 --> 00:35:20.931
Did you find the Colonel?

192
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.683
No.

193
00:35:24.143 --> 00:35:25.519
Winter.

194
00:35:40.034 --> 00:35:41.368
Where's the Colonel?

195
00:35:50.878 --> 00:35:52.046
He's gone.

196
00:35:52.421 --> 00:35:53.422
Gone?

197
00:35:55.508 --> 00:35:56.884
He left this morning...

198
00:35:57.968 --> 00:36:00.095
...took many men with him.

199
00:36:00.846 --> 00:36:03.557
More soldiers are coming
down from the North.

200
00:36:04.391 --> 00:36:06.393
The Colonel is going to meet them...

201
00:36:07.061 --> 00:36:08.646
...at the border.

202
00:36:09.688 --> 00:36:11.941
What border? Why?

203
00:36:16.695 --> 00:36:18.697
I don't know.

204
00:36:19.198 --> 00:36:21.742
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.

205
00:36:23.828 --> 00:36:27.164
The donkeys think the
soldiers from the North...

206
00:36:27.623 --> 00:36:31.085
...are coming to help finish
off the apes for good.

207
00:36:32.127 --> 00:36:35.047
That day, after the battle on the hill...

208
00:36:35.548 --> 00:36:39.051
The donkey we caught promised me
the Colonel would spare my life...

209
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:42.721
If I told them where you were hiding.

210
00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:46.892
Forgive me!

211
00:36:51.105 --> 00:36:53.816
My son...

212
00:36:55.484 --> 00:36:59.113
my wife...

213
00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:02.116
are dead.

214
00:38:14.688 --> 00:38:17.107
Now what do we do?

215
00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:19.109
Wait till the soldiers go...

216
00:38:20.194 --> 00:38:23.072
Follow them to the Colonel.

217
00:38:56.397 --> 00:38:58.107
Koba!

218
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:00.067
Ape...

219
00:39:01.235 --> 00:39:05.072
not kill ape.

220
00:39:14.248 --> 00:39:16.917
The soldiers are leaving!

221
00:39:54.621 --> 00:39:56.290
They stopped.

222
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.791
Get down!

223
00:40:10.471 --> 00:40:12.765
What are they shooting at?

224
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.810
I don't know.

225
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.562
Why did they shoot you?

226
00:42:01.665 --> 00:42:03.333
Like her!

227
00:42:04.543 --> 00:42:06.545
He cannot speak!

228
00:42:10.257 --> 00:42:13.468
He will die of those wounds.

229
00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:25.147
Luca...

230
00:42:46.043 --> 00:42:47.878
Where did the soldiers go?!

231
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:51.965
Winter said they were
going to a border.

232
00:42:52.216 --> 00:42:54.259
Yes, but which way is that?!

233
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:45.574
Bad Ape!

234
00:46:51.204 --> 00:46:53.915
Bad Ape.

235
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.044
Who are you?

236
00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.047
What are you doing here?

237
00:47:03.717 --> 00:47:05.552
I don't think he understands.

238
00:47:08.472 --> 00:47:10.098
I don't recognize him.

239
00:47:10.557 --> 00:47:12.392
He's not one of us.

240
00:47:14.394 --> 00:47:15.729
Are you alone here?

241
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:37.125
Cold?

242
00:47:53.934 --> 00:47:54.976
Cold.

243
00:48:00.607 --> 00:48:03.610
I see girl,
I think you human.

244
00:48:03.777 --> 00:48:05.111
But you ape.

245
00:48:05.904 --> 00:48:07.280
Like me.

246
00:48:09.115 --> 00:48:10.617
No, put down.

247
00:48:11.451 --> 00:48:12.786
How long have
you been here?

248
00:48:12.953 --> 00:48:14.246
Long time.

249
00:48:14.412 --> 00:48:16.831
Long, long time.

250
00:48:27.592 --> 00:48:28.635
Home.

251
00:48:30.178 --> 00:48:31.471
Old home.

252
00:48:37.185 --> 00:48:38.979
Are there more like you?

253
00:48:39.813 --> 00:48:41.648
More apes from zoo.

254
00:48:41.815 --> 00:48:44.442
Dead. All dead.

255
00:48:45.026 --> 00:48:46.111
Long time.

256
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.322
Human get sick.

257
00:48:49.656 --> 00:48:52.325
Ape get smart.

258
00:48:52.993 --> 00:48:54.619
Then human kill ape.

259
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.538
But not me.

260
00:48:56.955 --> 00:48:58.498
I run.

261
00:48:59.165 --> 00:49:01.167
You learn to speak...

262
00:49:01.501 --> 00:49:03.670
Listen. Human...

263
00:49:07.507 --> 00:49:09.050
"Bad Ape!"

264
00:49:11.303 --> 00:49:13.597
Bad Ape. Huh?

265
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.015
No.

266
00:49:15.515 --> 00:49:17.017
No touch.

267
00:49:18.518 --> 00:49:20.353
That's mine.

268
00:49:26.651 --> 00:49:27.736
I'm okay!

269
00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:39.581
Amazing...

270
00:49:39.873 --> 00:49:42.042
Always thought we were the only ones.

271
00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:44.586
Wonder if there are more in the world?

272
00:49:45.128 --> 00:49:48.715
More apes like us.

273
00:49:51.217 --> 00:49:53.428
Eat! Eat.

274
00:49:56.431 --> 00:49:57.932
New friends.

275
00:49:58.391 --> 00:49:59.934
Special day.

276
00:50:04.397 --> 00:50:05.690
Where did you get this?

277
00:50:08.735 --> 00:50:09.903
Bad place.

278
00:50:11.237 --> 00:50:12.614
I find long time ago.

279
00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:15.367
After zoo, I look for food...

280
00:50:15.533 --> 00:50:18.078
I find human zoo.

281
00:50:18.703 --> 00:50:20.288
Zoo for sick.

282
00:50:21.414 --> 00:50:22.874
Big walls.

283
00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:25.919
Sick human climb.

284
00:50:27.087 --> 00:50:29.798
Bad human kill.

285
00:50:30.215 --> 00:50:33.385
And then, all get sick.

286
00:50:33.551 --> 00:50:35.720
All dead now for a long time.

287
00:50:36.429 --> 00:50:37.430
Long time.

288
00:50:37.597 --> 00:50:39.057
Bad humans?

289
00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:42.310
Soldiers?

290
00:50:45.063 --> 00:50:46.314
Soldiers.

291
00:50:46.773 --> 00:50:48.441
A deserted military camp!

292
00:50:48.817 --> 00:50:51.236
On the border!

293
00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:56.116
Maybe the Colonel and the
troops are going there?

294
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:58.952
Is it far? Can you take us?

295
00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:00.912
Human zoo?

296
00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:03.790
No. No, no go back there.

297
00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:07.127
Everyone dead. I come here.
Very safe here.

298
00:51:07.293 --> 00:51:08.461
Never go back.

299
00:51:08.628 --> 00:51:10.130
Please, you must take us!

300
00:51:10.296 --> 00:51:12.757
No! No! Cannot take!

301
00:51:12.924 --> 00:51:14.968
Cannot take. No! No!

302
00:51:17.095 --> 00:51:18.304
Look! Look!

303
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:21.141
More snow. Cannot go.
Must stay.

304
00:51:21.307 --> 00:51:23.268
You eat, you rest.

305
00:51:23.435 --> 00:51:25.478
Stay here with me.

306
00:51:27.522 --> 00:51:29.441
Here, you keep.

307
00:51:32.652 --> 00:51:34.154
She keep.

308
00:52:02.015 --> 00:52:03.349
Who is...

309
00:52:09.397 --> 00:52:10.690
child?

310
00:52:11.858 --> 00:52:13.526
I don't know.

311
00:52:14.694 --> 00:52:18.031
But she with you.

312
00:52:20.575 --> 00:52:22.368
She has no one else.

313
00:52:29.167 --> 00:52:32.545
I see you look at her
just now.

314
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.384
Look sad.

315
00:52:42.931 --> 00:52:45.099
You have child?

316
00:52:48.228 --> 00:52:49.229
One.

317
00:52:52.065 --> 00:52:54.567
The other was
killed by human.

318
00:52:57.195 --> 00:52:58.571
Soldier?

319
00:53:15.588 --> 00:53:18.466
I had child.

320
00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:27.767
You think
you will find him...

321
00:53:30.937 --> 00:53:32.438
at human zoo?

322
00:53:37.902 --> 00:53:39.153
With soldier?

323
00:53:42.824 --> 00:53:44.826
I don't know.

324
00:53:46.953 --> 00:53:48.454
Maybe.

325
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.916
Then...

326
00:53:57.171 --> 00:54:00.466
maybe I take you.

327
00:55:43.403 --> 00:55:44.737
Thirsty.

328
00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:48.491
Thirsty.

329
00:55:51.619 --> 00:55:52.619
Thirsty.

330
00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.555
Luca, come.
Let's go closer.

331
00:56:10.722 --> 00:56:12.056
Keep them safe.

332
00:56:18.312 --> 00:56:20.148
What are they doing?

333
00:56:20.273 --> 00:56:21.607
I don't know.

334
00:56:25.737 --> 00:56:29.240
What's that? A patrol?

335
00:56:30.283 --> 00:56:31.659
I don't see riders.

336
00:56:37.123 --> 00:56:38.791
Hold it!

337
00:56:41.294 --> 00:56:42.628
I saw them coming!

338
00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.288
At least this time...

339
00:57:17.997 --> 00:57:20.166
I was able to protect you.

340
00:58:31.237 --> 00:58:33.281
Caesar...

341
00:58:35.074 --> 00:58:37.243
This must stop...

342
00:58:37.451 --> 00:58:39.745
It's not too late to join the other apes...

343
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.832
We cannot turn back!

344
00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:45.751
Luca gave his life!

345
00:58:46.294 --> 00:58:47.712
Please...!

346
00:58:53.092 --> 00:58:54.468
They must pay.

347
00:59:00.975 --> 00:59:02.935
Now...

348
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:06.606
...you sound like Koba.

349
00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:15.114
It was a mistake
bringing you all.

350
00:59:15.281 --> 00:59:16.657
This is my fight.

351
00:59:18.075 --> 00:59:19.660
I will finish this alone.

352
00:59:21.329 --> 00:59:22.330
Go.

353
00:59:22.496 --> 00:59:23.623
Now!

354
00:59:24.415 --> 00:59:26.083
Join the others.

355
01:00:53.587 --> 01:00:56.716
What happened?

356
01:00:58.384 --> 01:01:02.054
They came out of nowhere...

357
01:01:02.555 --> 01:01:04.348
Attacked us.

358
01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:07.518
We thought they would kill us all...

359
01:01:07.935 --> 01:01:10.187
But the Colonel stopped them!

360
01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:13.858
There was madness in his eyes!

361
01:01:14.025 --> 01:01:18.904
He said they would use us, before we died!

362
01:01:19.572 --> 01:01:21.824
And they brought us all here!

363
01:01:23.576 --> 01:01:24.869
Use you?

364
01:01:26.912 --> 01:01:29.874
They've been forcing us to work!

365
01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:32.084
What...

366
01:01:32.918 --> 01:01:34.754
What kind of work?

367
01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:38.716
Wait.

368
01:01:38.883 --> 01:01:41.385
My little son. Is he here?

369
01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:55.066
Grant and Lee...

370
01:01:59.111 --> 01:02:00.988
Wellington...

371
01:02:02.782 --> 01:02:04.450
and Napoleon...

372
01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:08.329
Custer...

373
01:02:10.623 --> 01:02:12.458
and Sitting Bull...

374
01:02:15.252 --> 01:02:17.588
You're probably
not much of a reader.

375
01:02:19.131 --> 01:02:22.301
But this is a big moment.

376
01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:25.137
Where were you?

377
01:02:26.305 --> 01:02:29.642
We came upon your herd.
We got lucky.

378
01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:32.812
But I was surprised
you weren't with them.

379
01:02:34.647 --> 01:02:35.981
Hey, hey, hey!

380
01:02:44.865 --> 01:02:48.160
I hope you don't come
to regret sparing his life.

381
01:02:49.703 --> 01:02:52.206
He's quite a good shot.

382
01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:00.881
Have you finally come
to save your apes?

383
01:03:01.674 --> 01:03:03.843
I came for you.

384
01:03:04.009 --> 01:03:05.511
For me?

385
01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:10.724
Who did I kill that night?

386
01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:12.351
My wife.

387
01:03:13.978 --> 01:03:16.188
My son.

388
01:03:28.033 --> 01:03:29.702
I'm sorry.

389
01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:31.996
I was there for you.

390
01:03:43.048 --> 01:03:44.425
My God.

391
01:03:45.593 --> 01:03:47.720
Look at your eyes.

392
01:03:48.387 --> 01:03:50.014
Almost human.

393
01:03:54.393 --> 01:03:56.103
How did you know
I was here?

394
01:03:56.604 --> 01:03:59.773
I was told you were coming.

395
01:04:00.858 --> 01:04:03.736
That more soldiers
from the North...

396
01:04:03.903 --> 01:04:05.863
would be joining you here.

397
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.114
Joining me?

398
01:04:07.281 --> 01:04:09.116
To finish us off.

399
01:04:10.534 --> 01:04:11.577
For good.

400
01:04:14.705 --> 01:04:16.207
Who told you that?

401
01:04:25.799 --> 01:04:26.800
Okay.

402
01:04:29.428 --> 01:04:30.429
Let's go.

403
01:05:09.468 --> 01:05:10.928
Father!

404
01:05:13.472 --> 01:05:14.682
Father!

405
01:06:37.014 --> 01:06:38.390
Lake...

406
01:06:39.224 --> 01:06:41.060
Forgive them.

407
01:06:41.393 --> 01:06:43.771
We've been through much.

408
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.905
Father!

409
01:06:55.115 --> 01:06:56.909
What have I done?

410
01:07:35.364 --> 01:07:37.324
Battalion, halt!

411
01:07:42.621 --> 01:07:43.664
Blood!

412
01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:45.082
Makes the grass grow!

413
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:46.791
We!

414
01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:48.210
Make the blood flow!

415
01:07:48.585 --> 01:07:49.795
We are the beginning!

416
01:07:49.962 --> 01:07:51.255
And the end!

417
01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:37.277
We haven't had food or
water since we got here...

418
01:09:43.408 --> 01:09:45.035
Why do they need a wall?

419
01:10:01.009 --> 01:10:02.094
Hey!

420
01:10:04.096 --> 01:10:05.639
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

421
01:10:19.486 --> 01:10:20.487
Hey!

422
01:10:21.405 --> 01:10:22.614
Donkey!

423
01:10:23.699 --> 01:10:24.741
Get him.

424
01:10:24.908 --> 01:10:26.660
Okay, okay, okay...

425
01:10:56.648 --> 01:10:57.774
Leave him!

426
01:13:37.267 --> 01:13:39.227
Tell them to get back to work.

427
01:13:39.603 --> 01:13:42.898
Apes need food and water.

428
01:13:45.776 --> 01:13:47.152
Tell them.

429
01:13:47.319 --> 01:13:49.279
Give them food...

430
01:13:49.446 --> 01:13:50.781
and water.

431
01:13:58.997 --> 01:14:00.082
Five...

432
01:14:01.374 --> 01:14:02.501
Four...

433
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.087
Three...

434
01:14:07.047 --> 01:14:08.215
Two...

435
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:29.194
Hurry! Back to work!

436
01:14:46.878 --> 01:14:48.380
String him up, donkey.

437
01:14:58.473 --> 01:15:01.059
Bad place.

438
01:15:03.145 --> 01:15:04.813
Bad, bad place.

439
01:15:07.816 --> 01:15:09.359
What you see?

440
01:15:15.574 --> 01:15:16.700
Must save them!

441
01:15:16.825 --> 01:15:17.826
But how?

442
01:15:18.034 --> 01:15:19.202
Must think!

443
01:15:19.452 --> 01:15:21.788
What would Caesar do?

444
01:15:23.039 --> 01:15:24.249
Oh, no!

445
01:15:26.918 --> 01:15:28.128
Why so small?

446
01:15:36.761 --> 01:15:38.346
Oh!

447
01:16:01.494 --> 01:16:03.663
What did the Colonel
promise you?

448
01:16:04.331 --> 01:16:08.043
You really think
he'll let you live...

449
01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:10.003
after we are gone?

450
01:16:11.129 --> 01:16:13.673
You let them
call you "donkey."

451
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:16.384
You are ape.

452
01:16:26.019 --> 01:16:28.605
Kerna want see you.

453
01:16:53.296 --> 01:16:54.714
Interfere
with the work again...

454
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:57.968
and I'll begin slaughtering
the apes one by one.

455
01:16:58.134 --> 01:17:00.136
Understand? I need that wall.

456
01:17:00.303 --> 01:17:02.931
Apes need food and water.

457
01:17:03.098 --> 01:17:06.643
They'll get food and water
when they finish their work.

458
01:17:09.145 --> 01:17:11.773
Give apes food and water...

459
01:17:12.274 --> 01:17:13.900
or they cannot finish.

460
01:17:14.067 --> 01:17:16.403
You know,
you are very emotional.

461
01:17:18.655 --> 01:17:21.866
What makes you think you're in
a position to make demands?

462
01:17:27.789 --> 01:17:28.957
Okay, let's go.

463
01:17:29.124 --> 01:17:30.875
The soldiers
who are coming here...

464
01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:34.045
they are not coming
to join you, are they?

465
01:17:35.672 --> 01:17:40.010
I saw men outside on the wall,
preparing for battle.

466
01:17:43.054 --> 01:17:44.597
They told me you were smart...

467
01:17:44.764 --> 01:17:47.726
but that's impressive.

468
01:17:47.892 --> 01:17:48.977
No.

469
01:17:49.853 --> 01:17:51.730
They won't be joining me.

470
01:17:52.105 --> 01:17:53.648
They are against you?

471
01:17:53.815 --> 01:17:56.276
They fear me.

472
01:17:56.443 --> 01:17:57.444
Why?

473
01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:00.196
Because you kill
your own men?

474
01:18:01.197 --> 01:18:03.199
We found bodies.

475
01:18:03.867 --> 01:18:05.452
Something wrong...

476
01:18:05.952 --> 01:18:07.746
with these men.

477
01:18:10.457 --> 01:18:13.877
Jesus Christ,
you are impressive.

478
01:18:14.377 --> 01:18:16.671
Well, you paint
quite a picture.

479
01:18:16.838 --> 01:18:19.049
What you must think of me.

480
01:18:19.215 --> 01:18:22.635
I think you have no mercy.

481
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.655
You came here to kill me.

482
01:18:43.907 --> 01:18:46.117
Were you gonna show me mercy?

483
01:18:46.284 --> 01:18:48.370
I showed you mercy...

484
01:18:48.536 --> 01:18:50.372
when I spared your men.

485
01:18:50.872 --> 01:18:53.291
I offered you peace...

486
01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:55.126
and you killed my family.

487
01:19:10.183 --> 01:19:11.309
Mercy.

488
01:19:12.477 --> 01:19:15.855
You have any idea what
your mercy would do to us?

489
01:19:20.026 --> 01:19:22.404
You're much stronger
than we are.

490
01:19:22.987 --> 01:19:24.989
You're smart as hell.

491
01:19:25.156 --> 01:19:28.034
No matter what you say,
you'd eventually replace us.

492
01:19:28.201 --> 01:19:30.203
That's the law of nature.

493
01:19:30.954 --> 01:19:33.206
The irony is,
we created you.

494
01:19:33.373 --> 01:19:36.209
We tried to defy nature,
bend it to our will.

495
01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:39.671
Nature has been punishing us
for our arrogance...

496
01:19:39.838 --> 01:19:41.297
ever since.

497
01:19:43.758 --> 01:19:44.884
10 months ago,

498
01:19:44.968 --> 01:19:47.137
I sent out recon units
to look for your base.

499
01:19:47.303 --> 01:19:50.432
My own son was a soldier
with one of the units.

500
01:19:50.598 --> 01:19:52.392
One day he suddenly
stopped speaking.

501
01:19:53.184 --> 01:19:55.895
He became primitive,
like an animal.

502
01:19:56.062 --> 01:19:57.397
They contacted me and said

503
01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.607
that they thought
he'd lost his mind.

504
01:20:00.442 --> 01:20:02.610
That the war
was too much for him.

505
01:20:03.611 --> 01:20:06.906
Then the man who cared for him
stopped speaking too.

506
01:20:08.032 --> 01:20:11.661
Their medic had a theory,
before he stopped speaking...

507
01:20:12.745 --> 01:20:15.748
that the virus
that almost wiped us out...

508
01:20:15.915 --> 01:20:19.294
the virus that every human
survivor still carries...

509
01:20:19.627 --> 01:20:21.796
had suddenly changed.

510
01:20:21.963 --> 01:20:23.214
Mutated.

511
01:20:24.966 --> 01:20:27.135
And that if it spread...

512
01:20:27.302 --> 01:20:30.346
it would destroy humanity
for good this time.

513
01:20:31.723 --> 01:20:33.057
Not by killing us...

514
01:20:33.224 --> 01:20:37.645
but by robbing us of those
things that make us human.

515
01:20:37.812 --> 01:20:39.856
Our speech,
our higher thinking...

516
01:20:40.482 --> 01:20:42.525
It would turn us
into beasts.

517
01:20:42.692 --> 01:20:44.736
You talk about mercy?

518
01:20:46.905 --> 01:20:48.823
What would you have done?

519
01:20:51.784 --> 01:20:54.204
It was a moment
of clarity for me.

520
01:20:54.913 --> 01:20:56.080
I realized...

521
01:20:56.247 --> 01:20:59.292
that I would have to
sacrifice my only son...

522
01:20:59.459 --> 01:21:02.462
so that humanity
could be saved.

523
01:21:05.048 --> 01:21:07.050
I held that gun in my hand...

524
01:21:07.217 --> 01:21:09.761
for a long time.

525
01:21:14.057 --> 01:21:18.019
I pointed it
at my only child...

526
01:21:20.563 --> 01:21:22.482
he looked at me...

527
01:21:23.816 --> 01:21:25.652
trust in his eyes.

528
01:21:28.655 --> 01:21:31.616
Even in his primitive gaze...

529
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:39.207
I felt his... love.

530
01:21:46.339 --> 01:21:48.383
I pulled the trigger.

531
01:21:50.677 --> 01:21:51.928
It purified me.

532
01:21:53.972 --> 01:21:56.349
It made my purpose clear.

533
01:21:58.142 --> 01:22:00.937
I gave the orders
to kill the other infected.

534
01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:02.188
All of them.

535
01:22:02.355 --> 01:22:04.649
Burn their belongings...

536
01:22:04.816 --> 01:22:07.110
and anything that might
spread contamination.

537
01:22:07.277 --> 01:22:09.862
Some of the men
questioned my judgment.

538
01:22:10.029 --> 01:22:12.657
I was asking them to do
what I had done.

539
01:22:12.824 --> 01:22:15.118
Sacrifice their friends...

540
01:22:16.327 --> 01:22:17.537
their family.

541
01:22:20.623 --> 01:22:22.375
Of course, they refused.

542
01:22:25.461 --> 01:22:27.130
So I had them killed too.

543
01:22:29.632 --> 01:22:32.010
Others with children...

544
01:22:32.176 --> 01:22:34.304
deserted into the woods.

545
01:22:35.305 --> 01:22:39.392
One of those cowards fled
to my superiors up North.

546
01:22:39.559 --> 01:22:40.977
They tried to convince me

547
01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.938
this plague could be
dealt with medically.

548
01:22:44.564 --> 01:22:48.401
That's when I realized that
they had learned nothing...

549
01:22:49.068 --> 01:22:50.653
from our past.

550
01:22:51.779 --> 01:22:54.449
You killed them too?

551
01:22:56.743 --> 01:22:58.661
What did I do, Preacher?

552
01:22:59.829 --> 01:23:01.497
You severed their heads, sir.

553
01:23:02.915 --> 01:23:05.126
Except for the one I spared...

554
01:23:05.293 --> 01:23:07.962
so that he could return,
and deliver a message.

555
01:23:08.129 --> 01:23:10.590
If they wanted to
relieve me of my command...

556
01:23:10.757 --> 01:23:13.593
they would have to
meet me here...

557
01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.720
and do it themselves.

558
01:23:15.887 --> 01:23:17.680
This used to be
a weapons depot.

559
01:23:18.431 --> 01:23:20.642
They turned it
into a relocation camp

560
01:23:20.725 --> 01:23:23.186
when the crisis
was just beginning.

561
01:23:23.686 --> 01:23:25.855
But the weapons
are still here...

562
01:23:26.522 --> 01:23:27.982
inside the mountain.

563
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:29.651
How many men...

564
01:23:29.817 --> 01:23:31.444
will be coming?

565
01:23:31.611 --> 01:23:34.781
Probably all of them.
But don't get any ideas.

566
01:23:34.947 --> 01:23:38.368
The only thing they fear more
than me is you apes.

567
01:23:45.249 --> 01:23:49.212
This is... a holy war.

568
01:23:50.755 --> 01:23:54.509
All of human history
has led to this moment.

569
01:23:55.426 --> 01:23:57.220
If we lose...

570
01:23:58.012 --> 01:24:00.390
we'll be the last
of our kind.

571
01:24:00.556 --> 01:24:03.101
It will be a planet of apes.

572
01:24:04.727 --> 01:24:06.729
And we will become
your cattle.

573
01:24:08.815 --> 01:24:10.775
Look at you.

574
01:24:11.192 --> 01:24:13.611
You think I'm sick,
don't you?

575
01:24:22.036 --> 01:24:24.789
I didn't mean
to kill your son.

576
01:24:26.666 --> 01:24:30.545
But if his destiny was to
inherit your unholy kingdom...

577
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.382
I'm glad I did it.

578
01:24:34.465 --> 01:24:36.092
Hey! Hey!

579
01:24:36.592 --> 01:24:38.177
Get back!
Donkey, hold him!

580
01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.847
Hey!

581
01:24:47.145 --> 01:24:48.855
So emotional!

582
01:24:56.195 --> 01:24:58.781
I can see
how conflicted you are.

583
01:24:59.657 --> 01:25:02.994
You're confused
in your purpose.

584
01:25:03.161 --> 01:25:05.413
You are angry at me
for something I did

585
01:25:05.496 --> 01:25:08.040
that was an act of war.

586
01:25:08.207 --> 01:25:12.962
But you're taking this all
much too personally.

587
01:25:14.922 --> 01:25:16.924
What do you think...

588
01:25:17.216 --> 01:25:21.679
my men would have done to your
apes if you had killed me?

589
01:25:23.014 --> 01:25:25.475
Or is killing me
more important?

590
01:25:38.196 --> 01:25:39.906
Soldiers everywhere!

591
01:25:40.156 --> 01:25:41.532
How will we get in?

592
01:25:43.034 --> 01:25:44.994
Must get in somehow...

593
01:25:45.411 --> 01:25:46.913
Must get in!

594
01:25:48.748 --> 01:25:49.999
In? In?

595
01:25:51.042 --> 01:25:52.043
No!

596
01:25:52.585 --> 01:25:54.879
No go in! No...

597
01:26:03.262 --> 01:26:04.889
Friends, friends!

598
01:26:05.056 --> 01:26:06.557
No, no go in.

599
01:26:06.724 --> 01:26:08.059
No go in...

600
01:26:11.854 --> 01:26:14.357
Friend! Friend!

601
01:26:18.069 --> 01:26:20.530
Thank you, friend.

602
01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:09.328
You saved our lives!

603
01:27:50.453 --> 01:27:52.580
Sick humans...

604
01:27:52.872 --> 01:27:55.499
...must have escaped down here!

605
01:28:00.338 --> 01:28:02.131
No! No! No!

606
01:28:02.298 --> 01:28:04.842
No! No climb!

607
01:28:18.731 --> 01:28:19.731
What?

608
01:28:20.066 --> 01:28:21.692
What you see?

609
01:28:28.824 --> 01:28:30.534
Wonder where we are?

610
01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.395
Oh, no, friend!

611
01:28:58.729 --> 01:29:00.106
Oh...

612
01:29:01.190 --> 01:29:02.190
No!

613
01:29:03.567 --> 01:29:04.568
No!

614
01:29:05.736 --> 01:29:07.446
No! No!

615
01:29:07.613 --> 01:29:09.240
No! Come! Come!

616
01:29:13.869 --> 01:29:16.038
Come! Come back! Come!

617
01:29:17.081 --> 01:29:18.249
No, come!

618
01:29:18.958 --> 01:29:21.919
Come! Come! Come!

619
01:29:53.242 --> 01:29:54.618
Koba!

620
01:29:59.915 --> 01:30:01.292
Sleep.

621
01:30:02.293 --> 01:30:05.004
You cannot save them.

622
01:30:06.797 --> 01:30:10.301
Apes all die here.

623
01:30:13.304 --> 01:30:14.638
No!

624
01:30:14.805 --> 01:30:15.973
Yes.

625
01:30:17.975 --> 01:30:20.311
Join me.

626
01:30:36.619 --> 01:30:38.996
If he's still alive
in the morning...

627
01:30:44.627 --> 01:30:47.505
he goes to work
like everyone else...

628
01:30:48.464 --> 01:30:50.466
or you shoot him.

629
01:30:50.633 --> 01:30:53.719
Come! Come, come.

630
01:30:57.014 --> 01:30:58.849
She go in!

631
01:32:06.542 --> 01:32:08.502
Thirsty...?

632
01:34:25.222 --> 01:34:26.265
Hide!

633
01:34:26.932 --> 01:34:27.933
Quick!

634
01:34:38.235 --> 01:34:40.321
Humans will kill her!

635
01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:44.074
I know what to do! Go!

636
01:34:53.042 --> 01:34:55.252
Arms up! Hey! Hey!

637
01:34:55.419 --> 01:34:56.962
- Arms up!
- Watch it! Watch it!

638
01:35:00.632 --> 01:35:01.633
Let's go!

639
01:35:03.761 --> 01:35:04.970
Keep 'em up!

640
01:35:09.099 --> 01:35:10.559
Follow him down.

641
01:35:14.772 --> 01:35:15.772
Keep them up!

642
01:36:17.376 --> 01:36:19.169
Are there others out there?

643
01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:28.345
Sweep the area.

644
01:36:29.513 --> 01:36:30.639
Put him in the pen.

645
01:37:14.266 --> 01:37:17.811
Feeling better?

646
01:37:23.025 --> 01:37:24.025
Good.

647
01:37:24.109 --> 01:37:25.819
Then we can talk about...

648
01:37:26.612 --> 01:37:28.155
Escape.

649
01:37:29.072 --> 01:37:31.033
Apes together strong!

650
01:37:40.209 --> 01:37:41.418
We are the beginning!

651
01:37:41.585 --> 01:37:42.753
And the end!

652
01:38:06.610 --> 01:38:08.278
Still alive.

653
01:38:39.893 --> 01:38:41.311
Send him to the quarry.
Alone.

654
01:38:45.232 --> 01:38:46.400
Hold on.

655
01:39:05.502 --> 01:39:06.837
What is this?

656
01:39:11.091 --> 01:39:12.676
How did this get in there?

657
01:39:16.013 --> 01:39:17.180
Get him to work.

658
01:39:31.028 --> 01:39:32.654
Thirty-seven.

659
01:39:43.415 --> 01:39:44.541
Fifty-five.

660
01:39:47.002 --> 01:39:49.212
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage...

661
01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:51.715
Fifty-five to the children.

662
01:40:30.671 --> 01:40:32.381
You know...

663
01:40:32.547 --> 01:40:34.341
Kerna shoot apes...

664
01:40:34.883 --> 01:40:36.385
when war is done.

665
01:40:40.097 --> 01:40:43.100
His war is madness.

666
01:40:44.267 --> 01:40:45.686
It won't save him...

667
01:40:47.604 --> 01:40:49.773
any more than
it will save you.

668
01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:51.733
I save myself.

669
01:40:52.943 --> 01:40:58.365
Is there anything
left of you to save?

670
01:41:20.387 --> 01:41:21.596
I do.

671
01:41:39.197 --> 01:41:40.782
Apes going back to the cage?

672
01:41:44.703 --> 01:41:46.121
You...

673
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:47.956
Are very brave.

674
01:41:49.458 --> 01:41:50.625
Brave?

675
01:41:50.876 --> 01:41:52.002
Brave!

676
01:41:52.711 --> 01:41:54.171
Brave!

677
01:41:59.176 --> 01:42:00.343
Ape?

678
01:42:02.679 --> 01:42:03.680
Me...?

679
01:42:03.972 --> 01:42:05.515
Ape?

680
01:42:13.356 --> 01:42:14.691
You are...

681
01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.955
Nova.

682
01:42:31.208 --> 01:42:32.375
Nova.

683
01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.722
Come! Come!
Come see!

684
01:42:45.889 --> 01:42:47.057
Come see!

685
01:42:47.891 --> 01:42:50.393
Come! Come see!

686
01:43:05.367 --> 01:43:08.078
34, 35, 36, 37...

687
01:43:09.246 --> 01:43:10.247
37!

688
01:43:12.666 --> 01:43:14.000
I do.

689
01:43:15.919 --> 01:43:17.754
What now?

690
01:43:26.388 --> 01:43:27.388
What?

691
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:35.772
Oh, no!

692
01:43:36.439 --> 01:43:37.607
Oh, no!

693
01:43:38.608 --> 01:43:39.901
No, no!

694
01:43:40.068 --> 01:43:41.278
No, no, no...

695
01:43:46.741 --> 01:43:48.034
Okay.

696
01:44:54.017 --> 01:44:56.603
This is the ape I told you about!

697
01:44:58.688 --> 01:45:00.398
Thank you.

698
01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:18.959
Bad Ape.

699
01:45:39.688 --> 01:45:40.688
What's wrong?

700
01:46:00.583 --> 01:46:01.710
We can't keep digging!

701
01:46:02.043 --> 01:46:04.212
It will flood the whole tunnel!

702
01:46:04.462 --> 01:46:07.257
If we don't, we can't reach the children!

703
01:46:26.943 --> 01:46:28.611
We must keep looking down there...

704
01:46:28.945 --> 01:46:30.780
Find another way to
reach the children...

705
01:46:31.156 --> 01:46:32.907
We must leave now!

706
01:46:33.199 --> 01:46:34.617
More soldiers are coming!

707
01:46:35.076 --> 01:46:36.619
Humans will destroy each other!

708
01:46:37.037 --> 01:46:38.913
And us with them!

709
01:46:43.585 --> 01:46:45.505
We'll have to get the
children out above ground!

710
01:46:46.296 --> 01:46:47.422
How...?

711
01:47:21.581 --> 01:47:22.582
Hey!

712
01:47:24.084 --> 01:47:25.418
You animals!

713
01:47:45.855 --> 01:47:46.940
Who did that?

714
01:47:48.108 --> 01:47:49.442
Who did that?

715
01:47:51.194 --> 01:47:52.320
Huh?

716
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:55.365
Who was it?

717
01:48:03.373 --> 01:48:04.624
Was it you?

718
01:49:57.403 --> 01:49:58.821
I love you, son.

719
01:51:08.725 --> 01:51:10.560
Go, go, go.

720
01:51:28.411 --> 01:51:29.746
Hurry! Let's go!

721
01:51:34.751 --> 01:51:36.586
Caesar, what's wrong?

722
01:51:47.221 --> 01:51:48.848
Hurry, you must go.

723
01:51:49.932 --> 01:51:51.768
Without you?

724
01:51:52.393 --> 01:51:54.103
No...

725
01:51:54.187 --> 01:51:55.897
Maurice was right.

726
01:52:00.777 --> 01:52:02.403
I am...

727
01:52:03.404 --> 01:52:04.697
like Koba.

728
01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:06.866
He could not...

729
01:52:08.034 --> 01:52:09.911
escape his hate.

730
01:52:15.958 --> 01:52:18.294
And I still cannot escape mine.

731
01:52:24.759 --> 01:52:26.302
Go, go, go.

732
01:52:28.721 --> 01:52:29.722
Fire!

733
01:53:13.099 --> 01:53:15.435
Colonel! Colonel!

734
01:53:17.854 --> 01:53:19.272
Where the hell is he?

735
01:53:53.014 --> 01:53:55.391
Down! Down! Down!

736
01:53:56.893 --> 01:53:58.060
Get down!

737
01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.483
Take him out!

738
01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:28.247
Come on, donkey.
Let's go! Reload!

739
01:59:03.783 --> 01:59:06.285
Colonel, are you in there?
Colonel!

740
01:59:06.952 --> 01:59:08.496
Just break it down.

741
01:59:48.577 --> 01:59:49.577
Donkey!

742
01:59:50.329 --> 01:59:51.705
Grenade launcher!

743
02:00:48.929 --> 02:00:51.974
God damn it, donkey!
Get me the launcher!

744
02:05:01.014 --> 02:05:04.059
Oh, no! Oh, no!

745
02:05:04.226 --> 02:05:06.186
Oh, no! Oh, no!

746
02:09:11.723 --> 02:09:13.392
Don't worry.

747
02:09:17.979 --> 02:09:19.398
Maurice.

748
02:09:23.235 --> 02:09:27.739
You are all home now.

749
02:09:31.576 --> 02:09:33.787
Apes are strong.

750
02:09:37.833 --> 02:09:39.126
With...

751
02:09:40.335 --> 02:09:42.170
or without me.

752
02:10:09.322 --> 02:10:11.032
Son...

753
02:10:13.535 --> 02:10:15.537
will know...

754
02:10:16.997 --> 02:10:18.373
who...

755
02:10:19.624 --> 02:10:21.042
was...

756
02:10:22.335 --> 02:10:23.670
father.

757
02:10:34.639 --> 02:10:36.224
And what...

758
02:10:38.393 --> 02:10:39.895
Caesar...

759
02:10:43.064 --> 02:10:44.357
did...

760
02:10:45.817 --> 02:10:47.319
