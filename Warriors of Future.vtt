[Tyler] Earth was so pretty back then.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.541
Give Dad a kiss.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.250
One more.

03:35.125 --> 03:38.041
[Tyler] <i>When I told my daughter
how beautiful Earth used to be,</i>

03:38.833 --> 03:40.083
<i>she didn't say a thing.</i>

03:40.166 --> 03:41.500
<i>Because what she saw</i>

03:42.250 --> 03:43.833
<i>wasn't the same world anymore.</i>

03:46.291 --> 03:50.583
<i>In the past century,
technology has been developing rapidly,</i>

03:51.375 --> 03:54.750
<i>brought about by men's continuous battles
to reign supreme on Earth.</i>

03:55.250 --> 03:57.750
<i>Since the development of military robots,</i>

03:57.833 --> 03:59.916
<i>wars have been skyrocketing all over.</i>

04:00.000 --> 04:02.833
<i>I thought after the battle two years ago,</i>

04:02.916 --> 04:04.333
<i>people would learn their lesson,</i>

04:04.916 --> 04:07.500
<i>and return to a harmonious world.</i>

04:08.791 --> 04:10.250
<i>But I didn't expect</i>

04:10.791 --> 04:14.083
<i>that this became the time
for mankind to pay the price.</i>

04:15.625 --> 04:18.875
<i>Natural disasters,
industrial overdevelopment,</i>

04:18.958 --> 04:20.291
<i>and nonstop wars</i>

04:20.833 --> 04:23.583
<i>made the global ecology worse and worse.</i>

04:24.125 --> 04:26.791
<i>Diseases and famine shroud the world.</i>

04:30.083 --> 04:33.125
<i>The air is now filled
with high levels of toxins,</i>

04:33.791 --> 04:37.083
<i>causing many children to be born
with severe illnesses,</i>

04:39.250 --> 04:41.958
<i>including my own daughter,</i>

04:42.458 --> 04:43.458
<i>Sissy.</i>

04:45.791 --> 04:49.583

04:49.666 --> 04:51.000
<i>governments around the world</i>

04:51.083 --> 04:54.500
<i>started building Skynets
that could purify the toxic air.</i>

04:57.708 --> 04:59.750
<i>But while the Skynets were being built,</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:02.875
<i>a giant meteorite fell onto B16.</i>

05:04.583 --> 05:08.291
<i>And out of it, a giant alien plant
began to emerge.</i>

05:09.083 --> 05:12.541
<i>This plant thrives
when in contact with water,</i>

05:13.125 --> 05:14.375
<i>wreaking serious havoc.</i>

05:14.458 --> 05:15.666
[indistinct screaming]

05:15.750 --> 05:19.791

<i>remains to be seen.</i>

05:31.291 --> 05:33.041
<i>But as a friend once said,</i>

05:33.125 --> 05:35.916
<i>"We write the ending of our own stories."</i>

[Tyler] Slacking off again?

06:10.541 --> 06:12.416
[Johnson Cheng]
Just breathing in some fresh air.

06:13.625 --> 06:15.166
[Tyler] Breathe while you still can.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.500
HQ sent over an entire robot unit.

06:18.583 --> 06:21.166
It seems like
we're in big trouble this time.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.041
It's big, all right.
But it's gonna be a big win for us.

06:24.708 --> 06:25.541
Scared?

06:26.041 --> 06:26.875
[scoffs]

06:26.958 --> 06:29.875
Scared? You fly the jet,
I'll take the Command Center.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.583
Sure! I'll fight, you'll attend meetings.

06:31.666 --> 06:32.500
Ouch!

06:34.750 --> 06:37.125
You'll fight? Then we're doomed!

06:38.458 --> 06:39.291
[sighs]

06:40.125 --> 06:41.625
Let me do the suicide missions.

06:42.291 --> 06:43.666
I want to see my daughter sooner.

06:43.750 --> 06:47.083
Sure. So Sissy can
call her father useless.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.041
Say what?

06:48.125 --> 06:50.708
Besides, if I die, what would you do?

06:53.041 --> 06:55.125
[shouts]
You're sick of seeing me all the time?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.416
Well, I'm used to it already!
Do I have a choice?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.541
Oh, really?

06:59.625 --> 07:00.458
[both chuckle]

07:03.125 --> 07:05.166
The broad is here. Let's go.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.958
Commander Johnson Cheng of B16.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.833
Take me to the Major General.

[Johnson Cheng] <i>Timora and Enigma?</i>

07:31.291 --> 07:33.666
<i>I thought HQ already decided
not to use robots.</i>

07:34.625 --> 07:36.750
Robots are often
more reliable than people.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.916
You have a gun.
You rely on it in combat, right?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.208
People wield guns.

07:42.291 --> 07:43.791
Do you trust guns or people?

07:43.875 --> 07:46.500
I trust robots more.
People can make mistakes.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.250
[indistinct chatter]

07:50.583 --> 07:51.458
Lucy.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.916
It's hard to repair this watch.

07:56.958 --> 07:59.166
I'll teach you how to,
just in case I don't--

08:05.708 --> 08:08.125
[man] Look at those lovers.
They're always like that.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.666
Don't you plan on coming back?

08:15.750 --> 08:17.375
Of course I want to come back.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.708
But you know how missions can be.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.833
It's hard to say.

08:21.916 --> 08:23.125
Nobody's forcing you to go.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.041
It's the Air Combat Unit.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.500
Why? Do you want to be Commander-in-Chief?

08:29.583 --> 08:30.541
[gasps]

08:46.416 --> 08:47.666
Colonel Tam.

08:50.708 --> 08:52.208
[Colonel Tam]
According to scientific research,

08:52.291 --> 08:56.208
Pandora's growth rate is proportional
to the amount of rainfall.

08:57.125 --> 09:00.958
According to the weather forecast,
B16 will experience two rainstorms.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.166
The first one won't have
more than 10 mm of rain,

09:04.250 --> 09:06.583
but it will cover 2 km of the area.

09:06.666 --> 09:10.583
The second one, though,
will exceed 150 mm of rain,

09:10.666 --> 09:14.916
covering the entire B16,
affecting its 5.6-million population.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.125
That's why the operation must succeed
before the second storm.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.166
HQ plans to exterminate it?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.208
Not to exterminate, but to alter it.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.625
This is Dr. Chan Chung Chong, director of
the scientific research institute

09:26.708 --> 09:28.000
that developed the gene bullets.

09:28.083 --> 09:31.166
He will explain in detail
the plan to alter Pandora.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.458
Based on our current findings,

09:36.041 --> 09:39.500
Pandora absorbs pollutants,
then releases harmless hydrogen.

09:39.583 --> 09:43.666
If we can reduce its destructiveness,
there may still be hope for mankind.

09:44.791 --> 09:46.708
Lab number 9 in F9

09:48.083 --> 09:50.125
had a breakthrough discovery
four days ago.

09:51.916 --> 09:56.750
Pandora's cells had an obvious reaction
to a rare virus called P7N9.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.041
The virus triggered
its self-defense mechanism,

09:59.125 --> 10:02.125
dropping its temperature
to negative 30 degrees,

10:02.791 --> 10:04.208
then entered a state of hibernation.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.041
Inside this gene bullet

10:09.750 --> 10:11.458
is the P7N9.

10:11.541 --> 10:15.541
If we can release the virus
inside Pandora's pistil,

10:15.625 --> 10:17.291
we can stop it from growing.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.583
Have you made an assessment

10:19.666 --> 10:22.041
about the success rate of this mission?

10:22.125 --> 10:23.875
To increase our success rate,

10:23.958 --> 10:26.958
HQ has dispatched
the robot unit to execute it.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.250
As long as one gene bullet
can enter the pistil,

10:30.333 --> 10:32.333
our mission will be accomplished.

10:32.416 --> 10:34.750
Major General, if this mission succeeds,

10:34.833 --> 10:37.625
Pandora can be used
to purify the atmosphere.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.083
Purify the atmosphere?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.791
So we'll stop building the Skynets?

10:47.875 --> 10:49.458
Do you have any idea

10:49.541 --> 10:53.291
how much time and effort
I put into building the Skynets?

10:53.375 --> 10:54.458
[Colonel Tam] Major General.

10:54.541 --> 10:58.333
I think HQ has told you
about the importance of this mission.

10:58.416 --> 11:00.708
I hope the Air Combat Unit
will provide assistance.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.625
[beeping]

11:07.708 --> 11:10.458
What if this mission fails?
Do you have a backup plan?

11:10.541 --> 11:11.750
We have a plan B.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.916
We will send out Orca bombers

11:14.000 --> 11:16.791
<i>to destroy Pandora
before the second rainstorm.</i>

11:17.958 --> 11:20.333
<i>Bombing range will be 14 km.</i>

11:20.416 --> 11:24.125
Within estimated 160,000 casualties.

11:26.958 --> 11:28.208
What about evac plans?

11:30.000 --> 11:30.833
[sighs]

11:31.625 --> 11:33.083
No evacuation plans?

11:33.916 --> 11:36.375
If Pandora is not altered
before the second storm,

11:36.875 --> 11:39.541
all 5.6 million people in B16 will die.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.916
And do we ignore the 160,000?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.625
Aren't they people, too?

11:45.541 --> 11:48.333
Unnecessary panic will cost more lives.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.000
That's why this operation
will be classified.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.083
[siren blaring]

11:57.291 --> 11:58.958
Program input has been completed.

11:59.541 --> 12:03.458
That means the robots can now
execute the mission inside B16.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.250
Commence operation.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.625
[dramatic music]

12:17.500 --> 12:18.750
[officer] The Commander is here!

12:24.125 --> 12:26.958
We will be assisting HQ
in finding Pandora's pistil

12:27.041 --> 12:28.750
in order to reprogram it.

12:28.833 --> 12:31.458
If this mission succeeds,
Pandora will be disarmed,

12:31.541 --> 12:33.208
but will continue to purify the air.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.000
This is the Operation Chief from HQ,

12:36.083 --> 12:37.083
Colonel Tam Bing.

12:41.916 --> 12:44.375
The combat procedure has four stages.

12:44.458 --> 12:49.416
<i>Stage one, ACU and mechanical units will
await instructions at Central Building.</i>

12:51.666 --> 12:55.791
<i>Stage two, shoot contrast agent bombs
during the first rainstorm.</i>

12:59.208 --> 13:02.791
<i>Stage three, once Pandora absorbs
the contrast agent or CA,</i>

13:03.750 --> 13:06.916
<i>the Skyfish will begin scanning
and start searching.</i>

13:08.625 --> 13:13.375
<i>Stage four, the CA will make its way to
Pandora's pistil where they will converge.</i>

13:13.458 --> 13:16.750
After the pistil has been located
and before the second rainstorm,

13:16.833 --> 13:20.500
robots will put gene bullets
in the pistil, which will alter Pandora.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.666
After the bomb drops,
how long till Pandora reacts?

13:23.750 --> 13:27.000
Reaction can be immediate,
or it could take a while.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.583
How long? Three minutes? Five minutes?

13:31.208 --> 13:32.625
What's the wait time for no response?

13:32.708 --> 13:34.083
Can we leave at once if there's none?

13:35.333 --> 13:38.291
How fast can Pandora absorb
the contrast agent we fed if?

13:39.916 --> 13:42.041
This is an unprecedented operation.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.416
Our scientists still have to
analyze Pandora's condition.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.791
You just need to follow
the Command Center's order to the letter.

13:50.583 --> 13:51.666
Do you know the variables that

13:51.750 --> 13:53.250
-exist in every second of an operation?
-Just follow the Command Center's order.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.875
-That's it.
-You don't know, so I'll say it.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.750
We'll get turbulence flying low.
Pandora will attack!

13:56.833 --> 13:58.541
Lives are on the line! Do we improvise?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.208
Do you know how many of us died
three months ago?

14:00.291 --> 14:03.000
In every mission,
there is always uncertainty.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.708
[heavy breaths]

14:06.583 --> 14:08.083
Only one thing is certain.

14:08.166 --> 14:11.625
Don't lose track of the CA's signal,
because if you do, the mission fails.

14:12.791 --> 14:14.458
[breathes heavily]

14:14.541 --> 14:15.750
I don't care if I die,

14:16.708 --> 14:18.375
but I won't let my men die with me.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.583
I don't think
this man's right for this mission.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.208
But he's the only one I trust.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.500
Then we'll use Plan B.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.625
There will be no Plan B for us.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.625
After Pandora appeared, the air improved.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.166
God is giving us this opportunity.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.791
The mission isn't just for us,
but for everyone.

14:49.666 --> 14:51.250
There's only one plan

14:51.333 --> 14:52.541
to accomplish this mission.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.291
These are dark hours
for the sky and the Earth,

15:01.875 --> 15:03.041
but not for our minds.

15:03.791 --> 15:05.500
Okay, men, let's go!

15:06.000 --> 15:06.958
[all] Yes, sir!

This is great stuff!

16:51.458 --> 16:54.208
Not the '78 remake, but the '56 original.

She didn't want you to go.
She's worried about you.

Can you still go on?

28:07.875 --> 28:08.791
I think so.

Where is the kit?

There's a hospital nearby.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.875
Let's see what we can find
to stop his bleeding.

28:35.166 --> 28:37.375
Mobilize other troops
to look for survivors.

28:47.833 --> 28:49.541
The mission failed. Time for plan B.

28:49.625 --> 28:51.416
Order Orca 2 to do a final inspection--

28:51.500 --> 28:52.666
The mission hasn't failed yet.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.583
We have three hours before the next storm.

28:55.666 --> 28:58.125
We just need to locate them first,
then the mission goes on.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.708
But all the planes used in the operation--

28:59.791 --> 29:01.541
No signal only means we've lost contact.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.291
Even if they are still alive,

29:04.375 --> 29:05.666
if we cannot locate the pistil,

29:05.750 --> 29:07.708
our operation cannot proceed.

29:07.791 --> 29:09.166
[Dr. Chan] All the water has converged.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.291
They're close to the pistil.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.791
-[Colonel Tam] Who else can go now?
-I'll go.

29:18.541 --> 29:19.708
With what?

29:19.791 --> 29:21.083
We have another Orca.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.416
You can't! If anything happens
to this Orca,

29:23.500 --> 29:24.916
we can't execute plan B.

29:25.541 --> 29:28.083
Then I can drive a vehicle,
or I can even go on foot.

29:31.416 --> 29:32.958
A hundred sixty thousand.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.416
There's still time. Just let me try!

29:38.041 --> 29:39.000

29:39.083 --> 29:41.250
Plan B will be carried out as scheduled.

[ominous music]

29:59.250 --> 30:00.333
[sighs]

30:12.916 --> 30:14.208
Why was the signal cut off?

30:14.708 --> 30:16.791
I've checked with the weather officer.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.500
A current of over 70,000 volts was found

30:19.583 --> 30:21.083
where Orca vanished on the radar.

30:21.916 --> 30:23.125
Probably a thunderstorm.

30:23.208 --> 30:27.166
A thunderstorm can't cause two planes
to lose contact for over ten seconds.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.666
So don't speculate. I want answers.

30:31.541 --> 30:33.250
My boyfriend was on that plane.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.375
Then help me find the answer.

Get an oxygen mask. Let him use it.

31:37.041 --> 31:38.125
You wear one, too.

31:45.416 --> 31:47.625
He's bleeding. Help me!
We have to apply pressure.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.250
Press it! Harder!

31:49.333 --> 31:50.875
[whimpers]

31:51.875 --> 31:54.625
Look after him.
I'll look for a hemostatic injection.

31:54.708 --> 31:57.875
Stay there. Don't let go!
Like this! Keep it pressured.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.583
Turn the GPS on. Wear your headphones.

32:43.458 --> 32:44.916
This seems out of place here.

32:46.083 --> 32:46.916
Hey!

32:50.000 --> 32:51.041
[Johnson Cheng] It's much better here.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.875
Something happened to the ACU, huh?

32:55.833 --> 32:57.333
So you want me back?

33:00.583 --> 33:02.916
After the mission, you can keep the truck.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.000
Just the truck? Are you that cheap?

33:06.583 --> 33:07.958
Three years of water vouchers.

33:08.041 --> 33:09.416
I'll be risking my life.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.958
Food stamps for four years.
I have them now.

33:11.041 --> 33:12.000
What else?

33:12.083 --> 33:13.416
You really think I'm cheap?

33:22.375 --> 33:23.208
Don't tell me…

33:23.958 --> 33:25.708
you've forgotten how to use it?

33:28.625 --> 33:29.666
[gasps]

33:38.875 --> 33:39.750
Lieutenant Taron Yau!

33:41.083 --> 33:42.041
Um.

33:42.125 --> 33:43.083
Let's go!

33:45.625 --> 33:47.833
Hey! Skunk! How does the movie end?

33:48.541 --> 33:50.083
The ending is tragic.

33:50.166 --> 33:52.500
Humans were defeated.
Aliens conquered them!

33:52.583 --> 33:53.750
Not worth watching!

33:53.833 --> 33:56.875
But not this ending.
We're gonna decide on that.

33:57.916 --> 34:00.333
The seat is too damn high!
What are you, a dwarf?

34:01.958 --> 34:04.125
We lost Skyfish 086 at 47th Street.

34:05.916 --> 34:06.958
Rescuing your friend?

55:48.625 --> 55:51.833
Dream on! It's just you and me now.
Don't you run out on me!

55:51.916 --> 55:53.708
There are two people outside.

55:54.833 --> 55:56.666
[Tyler] Yeah, a dummy and an imbecile.

55:56.750 --> 55:59.875
Perfect! Here we have
a sourpuss and an old geezer.

56:00.583 --> 56:01.625
Screw you, man!

56:14.583 --> 56:15.708
The box is up there.

56:17.541 --> 56:19.000
It must be 20 m high.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.041
If we both go, we might not make it.

56:22.125 --> 56:23.625
Maybe the imbecile can help us?

56:28.833 --> 56:31.791
If he didn't agree to drive,
you'd still be at the hospital.

56:32.625 --> 56:34.916
Be the big man here.
Give him another chance.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.333
[Tyler] <i>If you're so afraid to die,</i>

56:40.083 --> 56:41.583

Stop!

57:29.333 --> 57:30.291
I see the gene bullet!

57:35.625 --> 57:36.750
A grenade pin?

57:37.458 --> 57:40.708
[Lucy] <i>You lost contact because military
radio waves interfered with your signals.</i>

57:40.791 --> 57:42.375

1:00:32.125 --> 1:00:33.291
[Johnson Cheng] Connor's still down there!

1:00:45.666 --> 1:00:46.750

Who says I'm afraid to die?

1:01:27.625 --> 1:01:29.833
Hurry up! It's collapsing!

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:35.500
[Skunk] I'll do it!

1:01:37.166 --> 1:01:40.125
By the way, tell your friend
I'm not here to rescue him.

1:01:40.208 --> 1:01:42.666
And not only did I do the job,
I was so awesome.

1:01:42.750 --> 1:01:43.791
Just do it!

1:01:48.375 --> 1:01:49.541
[zapping]

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.083
[Skunk] Did I do an awesome job?

1:02:09.166 --> 1:02:10.375
[Tyler] Yes, you're amazing.

1:02:10.458 --> 1:02:12.166
You'll get a prize when we get out.

Move it!

1:02:50.708 --> 1:02:53.416
Command Center,
we've found the gene bullet still intact.

1:02:54.083 --> 1:02:55.875
<i>We're on our way to Pandora pistil now.</i>

1:02:57.875 --> 1:02:59.041
What's that?

1:02:59.125 --> 1:03:02.083
Let's go. We've only got
30 minutes. Central 5th Street.

1:03:02.166 --> 1:03:03.000
Copy.

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:04.416
What are you doing there?

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:06.791
The robots were the ones
who bombed down Orca.

1:03:08.333 --> 1:03:11.000
I found this grenade pin
from one of the robots.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.125
This was planned. It wasn't an accident!

1:03:18.125 --> 1:03:19.833
Someone wants the mission to fail.

1:03:23.166 --> 1:03:25.208
[beeping]

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:29.625
[Johnson Cheng]
Someone controlled the robots.

1:03:30.416 --> 1:03:32.791
Whoever it is, ordered the plane bombed.

1:03:33.958 --> 1:03:35.958
It must be that woman! She's the only one
who can control the--

1:03:36.041 --> 1:03:38.125
Someone else can, Sean Li.

1:03:39.208 --> 1:03:41.791
[Colonel Tam] Major General,
if this mission succeeds,

1:03:41.875 --> 1:03:44.375
Pandora can be used
to purify the atmosphere.

1:03:46.375 --> 1:03:48.125
So we'll stop building the Skynets?

1:03:48.208 --> 1:03:49.333
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

1:03:49.416 --> 1:03:52.458
<i>how much time and effort
I put into building the Skynets?</i>

1:03:55.083 --> 1:03:58.000
There should be evidence of Li sending
out the command in this robot's head.

1:03:58.083 --> 1:03:59.083
-Find it!
-[Connor] Yes, sir!

1:04:01.583 --> 1:04:03.833

<i>No use denying. You're busted!</i>

1:04:15.125 --> 1:04:15.958
Really?

1:04:16.541 --> 1:04:18.708
Stop already. You can still turn back.

1:04:19.458 --> 1:04:21.791
The day I started building the Skynets,

1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:25.750
I already knew
that I would devote myself to it.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000
<i>Even if it meant sacrificing you,</i>

1:04:29.083 --> 1:04:31.708
<i>or the lives of 160,000 people,</i>

1:04:31.791 --> 1:04:33.541
I have no intention of turning back.

1:04:33.625 --> 1:04:36.166
Cut the crap. It's all for money, right?

1:04:36.250 --> 1:04:38.000
[Sean Li] <i>That's what you think? Money?</i>

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:43.625
The Skynet is me, I… I am the Skynet.

1:04:43.708 --> 1:04:45.541
Am I making myself clear?

1:04:46.333 --> 1:04:48.375
<i>One Enigma, one Timora,</i>

1:04:48.458 --> 1:04:50.041
and three robots.

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.916
We'll talk if you survive.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.583
Who knows? Maybe we will.

1:04:56.291 --> 1:04:57.125
That's great!

1:04:57.708 --> 1:04:58.666
Why don't we begin?

1:04:59.750 --> 1:05:02.375
<i>HQ won't receive any news
from you anymore.</i>

1:05:02.458 --> 1:05:05.416
<i>Let us see if you can get past
Timora and Enigma.</i>

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:06.416
<i>Good luck.</i>

1:05:07.583 --> 1:05:08.833
We've lost the vehicle's signal.

1:05:25.666 --> 1:05:27.291
-Any response?
-None.

1:05:28.041 --> 1:05:29.291
We can't contact ACU.

Skunk, how long before we get there?

1:05:41.916 --> 1:05:43.416
[Skunk] About 15 minutes.

It took 14 seconds for Orca

So I checked the communication log.

you could get away with this?

1:21:23.541 --> 1:21:24.833
It will rain soon.

1:21:25.750 --> 1:21:27.750
Your plan B has already started.

1:21:31.791 --> 1:21:33.375
They have to beat Timora first.

1:21:34.208 --> 1:21:35.375
Even if they do that,

1:21:36.416 --> 1:21:37.833
they have to blast a hole

1:21:37.916 --> 1:21:40.500
and find the route towards the pistil.

1:21:41.750 --> 1:21:43.291
You had an hour to do that.

1:21:43.875 --> 1:21:46.583

I would die just like that?

I told you there wouldn't be a plan B.

What do you know, man?

1:31:43.458 --> 1:31:46.125
I'm wearing this while sunbathing,
so I'd burn more fat.

1:31:46.208 --> 1:31:48.625
And I just follow
Johnson Cheng's advice for the hair.

with short hair.
