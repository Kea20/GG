00:02.493 --> 00:03.630
..."My Goddess" Bast

00:04.503 --> 00:06.036
Time is running out

00:07.530 --> 00:10.613
Please allow me to
save my brother from this disease

00:10.696 --> 00:13.423
I will never question your existence again

00:13.829 --> 00:17.146
His heart rate is dropping rapidly, what's up?
We're finishing a sequence now .

00:17.230 --> 00:18.980
Grio, hand me the control.

00:19.063 --> 00:20.496
Your command, Princess

00:26.296 --> 00:27.796
What is the success rate?

00:28.296 --> 00:29.563
.it's 25 percent

00:30.063 --> 00:31.496
We have to try another way

00:32.063 --> 00:35.413
King T'Challa's heart rate decreased to
31 beats per minute

00:35.496 --> 00:38.180
Princess, you must stay by his side

00:38.263 --> 00:40.996
I have to think, everyone get out

00:42.130 --> 00:43.596
Get out!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.567
What is the success rate?

00:50.650 --> 00:52.000
It's 29.1 percent

00:52.083 --> 00:53.117
Print it!

00:57.950 --> 01:01.634
Princess, I realize there is an emergency
...but I must warn you

01:01.717 --> 01:06.267
The success rate of this artificial heart herb
in achieving the desired effect is very small

01:06.350 --> 01:09.483
.I do not care! Has to work

01:28.776 --> 01:30.983
Greo? -
Yes, princess? -

01:31.683 --> 01:33.634
What is my brother's heart rate?

01:38.275 --> 01:39.617
…your brother

01:40.710 --> 01:42.867
is with the ancestors

01:50.250 --> 01:51.517
No!

01:55.483 --> 02:03.434
We give thanks for the gift of King T'Challa

02:03.517 --> 02:08.150
Black Panther "The Nation"

02:09.625 --> 02:12.692
Son of King Tchaka

02:13.259 --> 02:14.276
my son.

02:14.359 --> 02:19.792
A descendant of the revered King Bashinga

02:20.292 --> 02:22.725
The first "Black Panther".

02:23.092 --> 02:24.992
We release you

02:25.125 --> 02:27.225
Glory to the ancestors

02:48.425 --> 02:52.492

02:53.392 --> 02:57.492

03:18.892 --> 03:20.059
(tchala)

03:22.159 --> 03:30.809
"The tiger king lives in all of us forever,
and rests with the ancestors forever"

04:47.259 --> 04:49.425
Sorry

Marvel Studios

"a year later"

06:28.859 --> 06:31.992
United Nations
Geneva, Switzerland

06:32.992 --> 06:37.042
I have the honor to invite Her Majesty the Queen, Raymonda

06:37.125 --> 06:40.476
Lumumba's daughter and ruler of Wakanda

06:47.592 --> 06:49.576
France

06:54.375 --> 06:55.959
…Mr. President

06:57.192 --> 07:01.025
I believe I speak for all
Member States present

07:01.725 --> 07:06.549
When I say that I am deeply disappointed in Wakanda's failure

07:06.632 --> 07:10.242
To standby promises to participate
… in the global effort

07:10.992 --> 07:16.276
To tackle international challenges
to share resources and full cooperation

07:17.092 --> 07:18.576
concerning Vibranium

07:18.750 --> 07:25.867
"France" received information indicating the possibility
of using "vibranium" to manufacture weapons of mass destruction

07:26.250 --> 07:29.883
We don't know of a metal detector that can detect it

07:31.000 --> 07:36.533
It threatens global security and the non-proliferation regime.

07:36.617 --> 07:39.625
And now let's hear from Her Majesty Queen Raymonda

07:39.708 --> 07:42.192
Wakanda

07:47.275 --> 07:54.341
It has always been our policy to never trade vibranium
under any circumstances

07:55.042 --> 07:59.808
Not because of the dangerous potential
vibranium might because

07:59.917 --> 08:04.734
of the dangerous potention
that you may pose

08:07.317 --> 08:10.134
Outreach center for Wakanda,
Insongo, Mali.

08:16.683 --> 08:18.034
The surveillance cameras stopped

08:22.650 --> 08:25.300
Get down immediately!

08:25.383 --> 08:27.017
Get down! Come on

08:27.150 --> 08:29.234
Where are the "vibranium" tools?

08:33.482 --> 08:34.217
Who can reach it?

08:45.117 --> 08:49.217
You pretend to be committed here

08:50.283 --> 08:56.857
But we are aware of every whisper in the
corridors of your leadership and military installations

09:01.983 --> 09:04.534
They whisper, “The king is dead

09:06.817 --> 09:09.300
The Black Panther is gone.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.467
"They lost their protector."

09:20.683 --> 09:24.067
...the right moment has come."

09:25.050 --> 09:26.167
Let's attack

09:53.383 --> 09:55.734
Anika! Where is your spear?)

09:55.817 --> 09:57.583
Shuri gave me these two to try

09:59.769 --> 10:01.434
you like me more.

10:01.517 --> 10:05.967
…Our grandmothers provided us with spears because they are so delicate and elegant

10:07.617 --> 10:08.850
and lethal.

10:11.876 --> 10:13.967
This will not change and I am the leader

10:16.087 --> 10:17.334
Your command, General

10:18.038 --> 10:20.017
I asked you not to bring them

10:22.903 --> 10:27.917
Another attack happened last night
...on one of our call centers

10:28.617 --> 10:32.083
...and prove the involvement of a Member State

10:32.183 --> 10:36.134
It is being downloaded to your phones as I update you

10:37.950 --> 10:40.450
…As for the identity of those who carried out the attack

10:52.850 --> 10:54.400
Kneel!

10:58.017 --> 10:59.234
No thanks on duty.

11:00.303 --> 11:06.238
Let our rational response to this attack
... be a gesture of peace accompanied by a warning

11:08.167 --> 11:14.150
Any other attempt to take over our resources
will be considered direct assault

11:14.717 --> 11:18.517
Our reaction to it will be much greater

11:19.957 --> 11:22.450
The parting of our King tears our hearts apart

11:23.350 --> 11:25.867
But don't think for a moment

11:25.950 --> 11:30.500
Wakanda has lost its ability
to protect its resources

11:31.216 --> 11:37.617
We are aware of the relentless efforts of some to
find vibranium outside of Wakanda

11:38.510 --> 11:42.367
Good luck finding it in your dreams

11:46.664 --> 11:50.083
"Atlantic Ocean"

11:47.237 --> 11:50.634
Helicopter 625 requests permission to land

11:54.863 --> 11:57.025
Well, meet you there. -
All right.

12:00.017 --> 12:01.300
Welcome!

12:01.383 --> 12:03.900
I thought you were retired! -
So am I!

12:03.983 --> 12:07.567
They said that machine's chance of finding
vibranium was one in a billion

12:07.650 --> 12:09.100
even less.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.117
Here we go

12:32.950 --> 12:35.783
The pressure of the suit is stable at one below zero.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.667
Depth 243 metres,
passing the thermocline

12:44.750 --> 12:46.367
My vital signs are stable

12:48.483 --> 12:49.567
Science.

12:59.050 --> 13:00.300
We hit the bottom

13:07.817 --> 13:11.467
Excellent, you're near the spot, Salazar

13:12.710 --> 13:14.983
yeah, it's amazing.

13:16.943 --> 13:19.627
It looks like the drill hit a metal material.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.417
Whatever it is, it's really solid.

13:23.017 --> 13:25.583
I've never seen a drill
in this much damage

13:28.923 --> 13:29.934
I can't believe my eyes

13:30.750 --> 13:32.300
Vibranium in the ocean.

13:32.383 --> 13:36.634
Let's get the vibranium detector out of there, since
we don't have any

13:37.217 --> 13:39.434
We're heading for the vibranium detector

13:51.350 --> 13:52.877
Communication lost, Salazar

13:52.960 --> 13:55.067
Yes, the power went out

13:55.150 --> 13:56.600
You know, I'll fix it on my own

14:12.517 --> 14:13.634
What was that?

14:27.683 --> 14:28.834
Jackson

14:28.917 --> 14:30.734
Tell me you see this.

14:31.370 --> 14:35.200
Hey, Salazar's heart rate is going up! Salazar,
can you show me what you see?

14:37.117 --> 14:41.034
It's a ghost jellyfish
! I've never seen one this color!

14:40.183 --> 14:41.034
"signal lost"

14:41.892 --> 14:43.134
Prepare the emergency diving team!

14:43.217 --> 14:47.550
Salazar, we just lost
Jackson's vital signs. do you see him

14:55.450 --> 14:57.134
No, he's gone

14:57.217 --> 14:59.234
Can you explain? What do you mean by "gone"?

15:00.950 --> 15:02.434
Do you hear me, Salazar?

15:03.683 --> 15:05.300
Salizar?

15:05.383 --> 15:07.267
"signal lost"

15:08.983 --> 15:10.734
Smitty, we have a problem here.

15:22.683 --> 15:23.734
What's that sound?

15:23.817 --> 15:25.867
West, do you see the source of that sound?

15:32.450 --> 15:33.867
West, do you hear me? Around

15:37.276 --> 15:38.717
West, do you see something?

15:57.683 --> 15:59.300
It's a sonic attack.

15:59.383 --> 16:01.283
Smitty, put your earplugs on.

16:08.219 --> 16:11.200
We are under attack, send a strike team immediately

16:11.283 --> 16:15.834
Flag, distress call
Helicopter 625 is requesting immediate assistance.

16:15.917 --> 16:17.283
They are Wakandan

16:19.430 --> 16:20.650
This is certain.

16:36.650 --> 16:37.483
Henderson

16:37.517 --> 16:38.867
Smitty, we have to go!

16:38.950 --> 16:39.967
Henderson

16:41.617 --> 16:42.450
Let's go.

16:45.283 --> 16:46.267
What is happening?

16:47.217 --> 16:48.067
Move off the edge.

17:04.781 --> 17:05.767
Go!

17:26.750 --> 17:28.134
Come on!

17:34.863 --> 17:35.967
Let's go right away!

17:36.050 --> 17:38.100
Spin the helicopter and shoot them down!

17:38.983 --> 17:40.600
Well, they are gone!

17:40.683 --> 17:42.150
God!

18:01.417 --> 18:02.467
Just get us out of here.

18:02.550 --> 18:03.967
We're all set

18:04.050 --> 18:05.367
We're all set

18:05.450 --> 18:06.734
Where is the attack team?

18:06.817 --> 18:08.967
They weren't Wakandan, they were blue

18:09.050 --> 18:10.417
...everyone died

18:12.383 --> 18:14.050
So what's going on?

18:13.450 --> 18:15.100
Warning: Failed to rotate.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.100
We are pulled back

18:16.674 --> 18:17.667
God!

18:23.817 --> 18:25.183
God! hold on

19:00.017 --> 19:04.416
Yesterday, Queen Raymonda of Wakanda
gave a scathing speech at the United Nations.

19:04.484 --> 19:09.667
While her army escorted the captured mercenaries
onto the land of the United Nations

19:09.750 --> 19:13.272
It's been a year since Queen Raymonda was installed
as ruler of Wakanda

19:13.355 --> 19:16.967
After the sudden death of King T'Challa,
due to an undisclosed illness last year

19:17.050 --> 19:21.734
All eyes are on the powerful nation
...as it becomes increasingly isolated

19:21.817 --> 19:23.583
my queen.

19:24.282 --> 19:25.967
We are approaching the river borders

19:32.803 --> 19:34.467
We got home

20:24.220 --> 20:25.483
Oh princess!

20:25.550 --> 20:28.240
Give me a moment, I'm in the middle of something.

20:28.323 --> 20:31.483
...I understand, Princess, but--
you are disturbing my thoughts--

20:34.683 --> 20:36.100
noise!

20:36.183 --> 20:37.016
Mom!

20:37.099 --> 20:40.500
I was trying to tell you the Queen's coming

20:40.583 --> 20:42.967
Thanks. -
This thing is making me nervous.

20:43.050 --> 20:46.867
I think artificial intelligence
will kill us all one day

20:46.950 --> 20:51.067
My AI isn't like in the movies, Mom . It
obeys my commands

20:51.150 --> 20:54.350
Yes, if only one's children were as obedient as he is

20:55.083 --> 20:57.667
Everyone seems to be working hard

20:58.450 --> 21:01.867
Yes, the Rapid Emergency Response Squad

21:02.569 --> 21:07.167
There may be many unknown dangers on the horizon.
The band provides solutions to confront them

21:08.250 --> 21:10.200
what is this?

21:10.283 --> 21:11.967
Exo suits for our army

21:12.050 --> 21:16.834
It grants its wearer superhuman strength,
speed and endurance

21:16.917 --> 21:19.300
But as always, Okoya has notes on it

21:19.383 --> 21:20.634
What were her notes?

21:20.717 --> 21:22.067
she hates it.

21:27.717 --> 21:31.912
How about reshaping the herb heart-shaped?
Have you made any progress in this regard?

21:31.995 --> 21:36.700
Excuse me, princess.
Ya's daughter Nakia is trying to call you again

21:36.783 --> 21:41.034
...perhaps you should--maybe you
should continue with your accounts as I have asked you-

21:41.117 --> 21:42.550
as you wish princess.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.817
I don't need the herb, mom

21:46.917 --> 21:48.500
I need a new technology.

21:48.584 --> 21:49.834
What about "Black Panther"?

21:53.250 --> 21:56.734
It has been a beacon guiding us to unity for centuries

21:56.817 --> 21:58.967
Out of date for the Black Panther, Mama

21:59.550 --> 22:03.800
I didn't want the herb to save our
flame. It was to save my brother

22:06.050 --> 22:07.250
noise!

22:20.983 --> 22:22.767
Do you know what today?

22:22.850 --> 22:24.283
Tuesday.

22:25.217 --> 22:27.050
I mean history, my daughter

22:32.850 --> 22:34.167
The memory of my brother's passing

22:34.917 --> 22:36.600
He died a year ago on the same day

22:46.317 --> 22:47.300
Did you prepare anything?

22:47.383 --> 22:51.250
Yeah, it includes taking me for a ride.

22:52.017 --> 22:53.317
right Now? -
Yeah. -

22:53.850 --> 22:55.934
And you can leave your kimoyo beads here.

22:56.017 --> 22:58.650
Mom! -
No, you won't need it where we go!

23:03.583 --> 23:05.599
And the other two beads as well

23:05.683 --> 23:06.750
Yes.

23:30.317 --> 23:34.034
You have to sit here with me and yourself

23:34.117 --> 23:39.234
It's the only way to heal the wound
left by T'Challa's death

23:39.317 --> 23:40.917
I'm fine mom.

23:42.017 --> 23:43.834
You don't have to worry about me

23:45.350 --> 23:48.975
We parted, but I'm moving on

23:49.058 --> 23:53.567
T'Challa leaving us in body
does not necessarily mean leaving us in spirit

23:54.356 --> 23:57.067
When that disease took your brother from among us

23:57.150 --> 24:01.817
I had to lead a wounded nation and a wounded world

24:01.917 --> 24:04.667
but I did spend time in the wilderness though.

24:04.750 --> 24:08.034
I roamed the valleys until I found water

24:08.117 --> 24:09.717
and sat.

24:11.217 --> 24:15.334
Then I did a ritual that I'm about to show you

24:18.050 --> 24:22.217
I felt your brother in the gusts of the breeze

24:23.416 --> 24:27.050
pushes me softly but firmly.

24:27.783 --> 24:29.917
I felt as if his hand was on my shoulder

24:32.483 --> 24:34.117
It took me a while

24:35.150 --> 24:37.050
but he was present.

24:43.496 --> 24:44.667
He wasn't there, mom

24:46.517 --> 24:50.383
Your feeling of his presence was a figment of your imagination

24:52.317 --> 24:55.450
At the risk of feeling some solace or joy

24:56.517 --> 24:58.034
No more, no less.

25:05.050 --> 25:10.183
What does your imagination weave when you think of your brother?

25:11.017 --> 25:12.850
Does it give you solace?

25:14.317 --> 25:15.583
Or torment?

25:29.359 --> 25:30.783
Come on, my daughter

25:42.273 --> 25:44.683
Where did you get it from? -
And what is the significance of that? -

25:45.403 --> 25:47.450
What does this have to do with your weather?

25:48.717 --> 25:53.300
Burning burial clothes put an end to the period of grief

25:53.384 --> 25:58.917
It marks the beginning of a new relationship
with our loved ones who left us

25:59.000 --> 26:00.400
I will not do this, mom.

26:01.883 --> 26:05.783
If you sit and think about my brother for long

26:07.517 --> 26:09.917
I will not burn these clothes

26:11.650 --> 26:13.183
I will burn the world.

26:14.617 --> 26:15.867
till the last of it.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.383
(noise)

26:22.750 --> 26:27.400
Shuri, there's something about your
brother that I need to tell you

26:32.067 --> 26:32.900
Wait, mom!

26:33.780 --> 26:34.900
What do you do?

27:00.383 --> 27:03.534
It better not be part of your ritual.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.950
Stop!

27:07.556 --> 27:10.334
who are you? How did you get here?

27:12.043 --> 27:13.750
this place is amazing.

27:14.517 --> 27:16.183
The air is pure

27:17.450 --> 27:18.950
…and water

27:20.417 --> 27:22.467
My mother told me stories about a place like this

27:23.050 --> 27:26.140
A protected land whose residents do not have to leave

27:26.223 --> 27:28.883
And they don't have to change their nature

27:30.050 --> 27:33.067
Why would one reveal his secret to the world?

27:33.150 --> 27:35.950
I'm not a woman who tends to repeat herself.

27:36.517 --> 27:38.385
who are you?

27:38.468 --> 27:39.500
I have many names

27:40.315 --> 27:43.617
My people call me Kukulkan

27:46.279 --> 27:48.234
My enemies call me Nemoor

27:49.817 --> 27:54.017
The U.S. military has discovered vibranium beneath
my kingdom 's soil

27:54.850 --> 27:56.150
…I could

27:57.210 --> 27:58.710
prevent them from extracting it.

27:59.493 --> 28:02.400
But we need Wakanda's help to prevent this from happening again

28:03.483 --> 28:06.634
They use a machine designed by an American scientist

28:06.717 --> 28:09.234
The "vibranium" only exists here

28:09.317 --> 28:10.900
In Wakanda

28:10.983 --> 28:12.983
Mom, he's literally wearing it.

28:16.248 --> 28:19.834
Your son revealed the power of vibranium to the world

28:20.450 --> 28:24.200
Because of that, all countries are searching the planet for it

28:24.283 --> 28:27.917
His choice, put us in danger

28:28.417 --> 28:32.334
I think Wakanda can find the
sign and bring it to me

28:33.217 --> 28:37.234
It's only fair that Wakanda would help us
solve our problem

28:37.317 --> 28:42.500
You are not entitled to infiltrate my kingdom
and determine for me what is fair.

28:44.083 --> 28:47.400
I have more soldiers than the grass of your land

28:47.983 --> 28:50.567
And their strength is unparalleled

28:51.150 --> 28:54.134
I don't want to go back under different circumstances.

29:00.183 --> 29:04.100
When you have
the marker, blow on this and put it in the ocean

29:04.817 --> 29:06.883
I'll come a little later

29:09.917 --> 29:11.334
...for your own good

29:12.003 --> 29:16.267
Never tell anyone outside of Wakanda about my existence

29:24.288 --> 29:26.650
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

29:42.927 --> 29:44.283
How did he do that?

29:44.807 --> 29:46.617
We have to call the council

29:48.042 --> 29:51.776
The air traffic control systems did not detect any activity at all

29:53.709 --> 29:57.626
Are the river borders breached?

29:58.882 --> 30:04.693
If my soldiers were there,
this Fishman would be chained in front of us right now

30:04.776 --> 30:10.393
If you had a brain the size of your muscles, it
would still be there choking on fluff like your muscles now

30:10.476 --> 30:11.693
Bald demon!

30:11.776 --> 30:13.793
Show some respect!

30:13.876 --> 30:14.859
respect"?"

30:14.942 --> 30:17.400
They should be ashamed to stand before us

30:17.483 --> 30:19.342
Watch your tone, son of the Jabari!

30:32.142 --> 30:33.626
...as I was saying

30:33.709 --> 30:36.526
No air surveillance camera caught him

30:36.609 --> 30:38.226
It was not detected by radar either

30:38.309 --> 30:41.626
So, he swam 100 km underwater?

30:41.709 --> 30:45.659
He was not alone and claims to lead a massive army

30:45.742 --> 30:49.576
...He wants us to hand him over an American scientist

30:50.242 --> 30:51.093
To kill them?

30:51.176 --> 30:52.193
Do it

30:54.702 --> 30:58.376
We've never encountered an enemy with vibranium before

30:59.209 --> 31:01.293
And the Black Panther isn't there to protect us

31:01.376 --> 31:05.626
The reason is that this council allowed
Killmonger to ascend the throne

31:05.709 --> 31:07.759
And burn all your precious heart grass

31:07.842 --> 31:10.293
Embaco, how do you think we should act?

31:10.376 --> 31:12.693
We have to find the "fish man" and kill him

31:14.042 --> 31:17.009
If we do what he's asking now

31:17.742 --> 31:21.926
So what's stopping him from coming back and asking for more?

31:31.342 --> 31:32.542
.as I was

31:34.042 --> 31:38.226
Is this my opinion alone,
or is this suit getting uglier?

31:38.976 --> 31:40.159
This is your opinion alone

31:40.242 --> 31:42.259
So, do you work? -
yeah. -

31:42.342 --> 31:46.426
That machine can
detect the modulated frequency of vibranium

31:46.509 --> 31:49.687
Through water, stones and even heavy metals

31:49.770 --> 31:51.593
Whoever built it is shrewd

31:51.676 --> 31:52.842
Come on, look

31:53.775 --> 31:58.525
Some of the parts are for the machine . Some of
them look like they were brought from a junkyard

31:58.609 --> 32:03.793
I'm still trying to comprehend
the presence of vibranium outside of Wakanda

32:03.876 --> 32:06.226
maybe fell more than a meteorite.

32:06.309 --> 32:11.393
Most of our planet is made of water,
so the other meteor's fall makes sense

32:11.476 --> 32:13.759
This changes everything we know

32:13.842 --> 32:17.276
The Great Mountain and all the legends and myths

32:18.109 --> 32:19.859
Those stories are etched in my mind

32:19.942 --> 32:22.259
How painful that sounds!

32:24.035 --> 32:26.742
So we need to find that sign at the end

32:27.609 --> 32:29.326
.I have an idea

32:30.176 --> 32:31.526
I will need a princess.

32:31.609 --> 32:35.893
On my dead body.
Its condition does not allow participation in field work,

32:35.976 --> 32:37.309
my queen

32:38.432 --> 32:40.793
Perhaps the exit will be relieved

32:41.448 --> 32:43.926
may be exactly what she needs.

32:44.725 --> 32:48.858
I can also complete this American operation with
my eyes closed

32:48.942 --> 32:51.476
Americans don't worry about me

32:52.112 --> 32:53.542
This is Naymore.

32:54.142 --> 32:56.028
Sneak through our defences

32:56.111 --> 32:58.282
This will never happen again

32:58.365 --> 32:59.626
He wasn't alone

33:00.509 --> 33:01.559
you will be with me.

33:03.062 --> 33:04.109
…if

33:04.942 --> 33:08.293
When are we leaving to meet my favorite colonizer?

33:10.858 --> 33:13.976
Alexandria
Virginia

33:37.165 --> 33:38.242
Come on!

33:40.342 --> 33:41.809
Yes I understand.

33:42.709 --> 33:43.809
Understood.

33:46.342 --> 33:47.459
slow down.

33:54.615 --> 33:55.859
Did you ever think of calling?

33:55.942 --> 33:57.993
And why would I have your number?

34:00.049 --> 34:02.993
We're looking for the scientist
who made the vibranium detector

34:03.642 --> 34:05.876
So you were responsible for what happened in the Atlantic?

34:05.976 --> 34:08.826
Do not pretend to be ignorant, drill ship.
You have left many victims

34:09.909 --> 34:11.876
What happened there? -
Seriously? -

34:13.822 --> 34:16.859
It was a joint operation. between us and the navy

34:16.942 --> 34:20.009
It has 30 of their best men,
and two of our best officers

34:20.092 --> 34:20.926
two friends of mine.

34:21.559 --> 34:22.391
They all died

34:22.476 --> 34:23.742
Simply.

34:24.509 --> 34:28.893
...aside from their vibranium mining -
I assure you, Wakanda has nothing to do with this.

34:29.942 --> 34:30.893
So who was he?

34:32.509 --> 34:36.726
It 's supposed to be a reciprocal relationship.
I give you information and you do the same

34:36.815 --> 34:39.116
For our own safety, we cannot tell you

34:39.842 --> 34:43.726
It is necessary that we get to the mark before something else happens

34:44.309 --> 34:45.376
You owe me, Ross

34:46.109 --> 34:47.493
you owe it to my brother.

34:51.476 --> 34:52.641
ok, listen.

34:53.286 --> 34:57.742
There are agents who have been sentenced to death for
revealing less information than they were about to reveal

34:57.842 --> 34:59.209
...and we have a new female director

34:59.876 --> 35:01.059
.watch me closely

35:01.641 --> 35:04.125
We will need to be very careful

35:04.209 --> 35:06.562
Not only caution, but speed as well

35:06.646 --> 35:10.383
The United States needs a new machine... and
that's the only girl who can make it

35:10.476 --> 35:11.926
So they will come looking for her

35:12.010 --> 35:12.969
girl"?"

35:17.076 --> 35:20.409
Cambridge
Massachusetts

35:23.108 --> 35:23.941
Hey!

35:24.024 --> 35:25.335
forgot to pay me.

35:25.418 --> 35:28.426
Mind you, 800 bucks, right?

35:28.509 --> 35:31.525
This was yesterday's price, it's a thousand today

35:31.608 --> 35:33.409
that's tough.

35:34.442 --> 35:36.395
I manufactured the whole robotic arm

35:36.478 --> 35:38.609
but you just corrected the fist algorithm.

35:39.309 --> 35:40.809
And what mark did you get?

35:46.842 --> 35:47.793
Thanks.

35:50.976 --> 35:53.059
Is this an iPhone? -
How primitive!

35:54.676 --> 35:55.642
my queen.

35:56.877 --> 35:58.459
We found the scientist

35:58.542 --> 36:02.221
It's in an American alternative
to a village school in Wakanda

36:02.304 --> 36:03.393
School"?"

36:03.976 --> 36:06.494
Please tell me she is a professor

36:06.577 --> 36:08.426
She's a student, mom.

36:08.509 --> 36:10.276
We can't turn it over to Naymore

36:10.842 --> 36:13.676
Take that student back to Wakanda

36:15.042 --> 36:16.909
I command you, my queen

36:18.942 --> 36:20.559
I'll take care of it from here

36:20.642 --> 36:22.736
Hey, maybe I should talk to her

36:22.819 --> 36:24.409
This will be less noticeable

36:25.205 --> 36:26.809
I can not look away.

36:30.131 --> 36:30.964
What?

36:31.482 --> 36:32.809
Nothing - is
the problem in the make-up? -

36:32.892 --> 36:33.725
no!

36:33.808 --> 36:36.326
The glasses don't fit, right? -
It's a perfect fit.

36:36.409 --> 36:38.009
Fenty 440, you look good.

36:39.509 --> 36:41.409
I can get involved with them as a student

36:42.289 --> 36:43.709
.I can do that

36:47.463 --> 36:48.793
I give you five minutes
- Yes!

36:58.976 --> 37:01.326
Solve this equation first or don't knock.

37:01.409 --> 37:02.242
Welcome!

37:02.325 --> 37:03.609
Riri Williams (?)

37:06.976 --> 37:09.642
I no longer work directly.
Go to the website

37:11.242 --> 37:12.609
It is an encrypted file.

37:13.276 --> 37:14.642
I wanted it delivered directly to you.

37:15.492 --> 37:16.325
...you are

37:19.177 --> 37:20.609
You are Princess Shuri!

37:22.276 --> 37:23.793
What on earth are you doing here?

37:23.876 --> 37:26.059
So, am I going to be recruited?

37:27.093 --> 37:27.926
!no

37:29.189 --> 37:32.326
I came here because of the vibranium detector I built for the
CIA

37:33.976 --> 37:37.726
I didn't make it for the CIA!
I made it for my metallurgy!

37:37.809 --> 37:39.893
school project? -
Yeah. -

37:40.476 --> 37:42.059
My teacher said it was impossible for me to do it

37:44.142 --> 37:46.242
But I proved him wrong like any other talented young black woman

37:49.129 --> 37:51.626
You probably don't say that in Wakanda

37:53.409 --> 37:54.859
How old are you?

37:55.442 --> 37:56.626
I am 19 years old.

37:57.309 --> 38:00.809
Mostly, adults do not accept the genius of children

38:02.442 --> 38:03.893
How long did it take you to make it?

38:03.976 --> 38:05.293
Two months.

38:05.376 --> 38:06.459
Two months?

38:06.542 --> 38:09.276
The hardest part was finding mylar chicks
...big enough to cover

38:10.542 --> 38:12.659
Wait, did you piss off Wakanda?

38:12.742 --> 38:13.575
Not just us

38:14.209 --> 38:16.276
This place is no longer safe for you

38:16.376 --> 38:18.726
Gather your things and accompany me immediately

38:19.842 --> 38:22.909
I have a differential equations class in 15 minutes!

38:25.376 --> 38:26.693
Good.

38:27.442 --> 38:28.275
Good

38:28.942 --> 38:30.976
...wait here

38:31.842 --> 38:33.209
I will enter the toilet.

38:33.895 --> 38:34.728
…Just

38:37.741 --> 38:39.776
I was in control

38:40.459 --> 38:42.893
You said five minutes and I gave you six

38:42.976 --> 38:44.593
Get out! Get out of my room

38:45.355 --> 38:46.426
Get out!

38:46.509 --> 38:47.593
Hey!

38:47.676 --> 38:51.826
I warn you! Don't ever come one step closer to me

38:51.909 --> 38:54.542
See how they teach kids to treat their guests?

38:59.442 --> 39:01.542
You brought a spear here?

39:01.625 --> 39:03.193
I brought a spear here!

39:04.072 --> 39:05.642
She likes me.

39:05.743 --> 39:08.059
Hey, put it down!

39:08.142 --> 39:09.876
You're going to hurt yourself, come on

39:09.959 --> 39:11.726
It's okay, princess

39:11.809 --> 39:13.759
little girl up.

39:14.415 --> 39:17.126
I will give you two options

39:17.708 --> 39:21.893
You can come to Wakanda
either conscious or unconscious.

39:22.842 --> 39:25.459
You have to know your shape first!

39:25.542 --> 39:27.626
You walk around with ash on your head!

39:29.709 --> 39:31.526
is this funny? -
No.

39:31.609 --> 39:34.193
I told you! -
You look good!

39:34.276 --> 39:36.326
Calm down! We're leaving, okay?

39:36.409 --> 39:40.665
And she can handle
this mermaid with winged ankles on her own

39:40.748 --> 39:43.593
who wants to kill her.

39:43.677 --> 39:45.893
You 're hers. -
Confront him with the heater.

39:45.976 --> 39:47.142
Let's go.

39:48.326 --> 39:49.159
What?

39:56.295 --> 39:58.593
What exactly is this place?

39:58.676 --> 40:00.909
I fixed a few trucks for the head of the sanitary department

40:01.742 --> 40:05.342
I am allowed to use that workshop in exchange for that

40:05.946 --> 40:07.326
I just have to bring my work computer

40:10.109 --> 40:13.059
Please, don't touch anything

40:13.142 --> 40:15.459
don't worry about this.

40:15.542 --> 40:19.142
It may not look like a fancy place,
but all my life's work is here

40:20.128 --> 40:23.393
So, designing the machine on your computer?

40:23.476 --> 40:24.626
Yes.

40:24.709 --> 40:27.209
And you leave it on a desk in a car shop?

40:27.909 --> 40:30.542
It is encrypted with a key of 2065 bytes.

40:31.076 --> 40:32.242
It is amazing.

40:33.042 --> 40:36.359
Have you ever been unable to access it? -
It took me a semester to do it.

40:36.442 --> 40:40.526
I had to build a functioning quantum computer
just to bypass my cryptography

40:40.609 --> 40:43.061
What are you building here? Is this Stark technology?

40:43.144 --> 40:44.572
I said don't touch anything

40:44.655 --> 40:47.797
Princess,
US law enforcement has reached your location

40:47.880 --> 40:49.242
Damn -
what was that? -

40:49.882 --> 40:50.942
artificial intelligence.

40:52.384 --> 40:53.726
They surround us

40:57.742 --> 40:59.942
Didn't you say that a mermaid is chasing me?

41:00.609 --> 41:01.559
It's the Feds!

41:15.276 --> 41:17.612
I don't need these troubles now!

41:17.695 --> 41:19.785
I swear!

41:19.868 --> 41:22.693
I show up for my class on time, I must be very stupid

41:22.776 --> 41:28.693
Quite foolish to think that the Princess of Wakanda
would come to my doorstep and misfortune would not begin to happen.

41:28.776 --> 41:32.593
I think I will venture and face this mermaid.

41:32.676 --> 41:36.393
Because at least the
feds didn't come to my workshop

41:36.476 --> 41:41.216
...Listen, Neymore sank an intelligence ship

41:41.299 --> 41:43.892
Because of your machine?

41:43.976 --> 41:47.593
So the cops out there are the
least of you to worry about

41:47.676 --> 41:50.259
We have to cooperate to get out of here

41:50.342 --> 41:52.893
General, they surround us

41:52.976 --> 41:54.509
Maybe we should just part

41:55.258 --> 41:56.376
On My Body.

41:56.459 --> 41:57.842
Does this car work?

41:58.918 --> 41:59.751
No.

42:01.109 --> 42:04.226
Everything in this lab works so this bike.

42:04.309 --> 42:06.342
Don't even think about this

42:06.438 --> 42:08.626
besides we are three people.

42:08.709 --> 42:10.976
Two people, I'm taking this

42:12.858 --> 42:13.909
I was sure.

42:13.992 --> 42:16.959
Don't tell me you made it in two months

42:17.042 --> 42:20.093
It took me years to make it...on and off

42:20.176 --> 42:22.209
Beautiful, have you ever flown with it?

42:22.909 --> 42:24.093
Is it wide to fly?

42:24.176 --> 42:27.759
There is a YouTube channel that just shows me flying on it

42:27.842 --> 42:28.826
that's cool.

42:29.635 --> 42:32.329
We have an arrest warrant for student Riri Williams!

42:32.412 --> 42:33.959
Wireless communication device.

42:34.042 --> 42:36.226
Until we communicate together. -
Don't try to run away from us.

42:36.309 --> 42:40.609
General Okoya and Princess Shuri,
come out with your hands up

42:41.512 --> 42:44.809
What junk! -
Listen, handle it carefully, please.

42:44.892 --> 42:47.042
Keys on the seat.

42:47.125 --> 42:49.945
When we get to the other end of the bridge,
we can get lost in the Boston traffic

42:50.028 --> 42:51.993
General, we really have to part ways

42:52.076 --> 42:55.493
Listen to me, we are not in your lab but in the field

42:55.576 --> 42:57.109
Now get in the car

42:57.587 --> 42:59.209
You are always yelling at me

43:05.476 --> 43:09.976
The tactical unit will storm the entrance
...after three, two

43:10.920 --> 43:11.993
One.

43:13.506 --> 43:14.926
The Feds! Don't move

43:15.796 --> 43:16.809
What the hell is this?

43:16.892 --> 43:19.926
Die! She has an Iron Man suit! They backed off.

43:20.009 --> 43:21.559
Don't move!

43:24.742 --> 43:26.009
I think she can fly.

43:26.092 --> 43:27.393
Greo? -
Yes, princess? -

43:27.476 --> 43:29.084
Now! -
Activate Remote Driving!

43:29.167 --> 43:30.642
No, Shuri!

43:31.442 --> 43:34.475
Song name: "They Want It, But No"
"Singer name: Tobe Nwigwe"

43:40.509 --> 43:41.726
Let's go!

43:43.093 --> 43:43.926
"Grio!"

43:45.009 --> 43:46.359
Show me the picture!

43:54.409 --> 43:55.926
Greo? -
Yes, general? -

43:56.009 --> 44:00.707
Take me to the Princess,
or I will plunge my spear deep into your central unit

44:00.790 --> 44:04.259
To the point that you will be unable to
process the simplest data for a thousand years

44:04.342 --> 44:05.326
Give me a moment, General.

44:05.909 --> 44:06.959
Okoya, I'm on my way to you.

44:09.642 --> 44:10.475
"Police"

44:18.209 --> 44:21.259
Greo, let me control this car right now!

44:21.342 --> 44:23.426
I clear your way.

44:28.509 --> 44:31.526
You can control it, General.
Manual drive has been activated.

44:48.242 --> 44:49.926
We have to find a place to withdraw from

44:50.009 --> 44:51.326
There is one at the river

44:57.688 --> 44:59.059
They are blocking the bridge

45:03.376 --> 45:06.377
Princess, there's a drone watching you

45:06.460 --> 45:08.793
How high is it? -
Nine kilometers.

45:15.009 --> 45:15.976
Hey

45:16.542 --> 45:17.375
I'll take care of it

45:21.457 --> 45:24.609
Think about it, Riri, we have to solve the equations

45:25.547 --> 45:26.726
...when equal to relative velocity

45:26.809 --> 45:29.926
Riri, I don't think you can make it to that plane
without an oxygen mask

45:32.707 --> 45:35.409
The oxygen level is now 55 percent

45:36.336 --> 45:38.476
Eight and a half kilometers

45:39.452 --> 45:41.742
The oxygen level is now 30 percent

45:45.276 --> 45:48.109
Top speed, I have to adjust the Euler angles
... that's about it

45:48.775 --> 45:50.159
...a direct injury

45:56.476 --> 45:58.293
The oxygen rate is zero percent

46:02.042 --> 46:03.793
The drone is no longer tracking you

46:04.691 --> 46:06.881
The height is 150 meters and less.

46:06.964 --> 46:08.509
Riri, are you okay?

46:09.409 --> 46:10.426
Riri?

46:14.042 --> 46:14.875
I'm good.

46:16.042 --> 46:17.026
We are under attack!

46:17.309 --> 46:18.376
God!

46:18.509 --> 46:19.393
Die!

46:19.476 --> 46:23.309
And don't worry, I've got a special ride for you.
After three, two, one

46:24.742 --> 46:25.826
Well done, Riri!

46:35.076 --> 46:35.793
Riri!

47:04.076 --> 47:06.159
What just happened? Shuri?

47:06.893 --> 47:07.726
noise!

47:24.064 --> 47:26.359
The princess's vital signs are
stable, General

47:26.442 --> 47:28.542
She will regain consciousness shortly

48:03.455 --> 48:05.009
If you go one step closer

48:06.342 --> 48:07.593
I will kill you all.

48:08.325 --> 48:09.509
Put down your weapons!

48:12.142 --> 48:13.426
Kill the scientist

48:13.509 --> 48:15.176
I will take care of the witnesses

48:15.709 --> 48:16.442
Present.

48:18.343 --> 48:19.226
Is it blue?

48:21.209 --> 48:22.893
Kill that woman first.

48:24.142 --> 48:25.593
Put down the weapon!

48:59.176 --> 49:01.326
Go to Namora

50:10.242 --> 50:12.842
I am not worthy of my prayer.

50:25.376 --> 50:27.059
What is the reason for the delay?

50:27.309 --> 50:29.926
It's not the right time to have fun

50:39.135 --> 50:40.302
(Okoya)

50:41.676 --> 50:42.509
Hey!

50:42.592 --> 50:44.259
Activating translation

50:44.342 --> 50:47.306
I am Shuri... the princess of Wakanda

50:47.389 --> 50:51.193
I demand that I be taken to Naymore
and that girl not be harmed

50:54.609 --> 50:56.259
Shall we take them both alive?

50:56.342 --> 50:58.109
Yes, Otuma

51:14.942 --> 51:16.096
Breathing

51:25.009 --> 51:26.142
(noise)

51:44.499 --> 51:47.278
Ross, from the agency, any witnesses?

51:47.361 --> 51:49.910
No, but I think they were the Wakandans

51:49.993 --> 51:50.826
Excuse me?

51:50.909 --> 51:53.059
Our office got a tip from Langley that they were coming

51:53.142 --> 51:55.026
Well, who was told that information?

51:56.215 --> 51:57.459
She is the actors

52:00.129 --> 52:01.442
Director (De Fontaine).

52:01.525 --> 52:02.526
seriously?

52:02.609 --> 52:03.442
…Good

52:04.595 --> 52:06.742
The client thinks they were Wakandan

52:07.309 --> 52:09.791
Yes, we've been watching them
one by one since they took down our ship

52:09.874 --> 52:11.409
That's why I wanted you to come here

52:12.304 --> 52:13.726
you look good.

52:13.809 --> 52:14.859
I try to do my best.

52:14.942 --> 52:17.493
Have you prepared your home gym? -
Yes, last year.

52:17.576 --> 52:20.476
Maybe I'll stop by your house
sometime...to practice on a pedal bike

52:21.176 --> 52:22.285
Welcome.

52:22.368 --> 52:26.393
I am the Special Agent in charge. -
Good luck! Are you going to show me the evidence or what? -

52:26.476 --> 52:28.693
Yes, after you. -
Yes, well.

52:28.776 --> 52:30.459
Well - so
what happened here? -

52:30.542 --> 52:32.026
We think it was a car accident

52:32.109 --> 52:33.959
But we can't find cars.

52:34.042 --> 52:36.393
What do you mean? Was the place like this when you found it?

52:36.476 --> 52:39.159
Yeah, we think someone got rid of the cars

52:39.242 --> 52:41.985
and how's that? -
I was thrown into the river. -

52:42.068 --> 52:43.542
Unbelievable.

52:44.561 --> 52:46.193
It has the Institute of Technology label on it

52:46.276 --> 52:48.726
.I want her transferred to the NSA immediately

52:48.810 --> 52:50.793
Ross, is your car full of gas?

52:50.876 --> 52:53.072
Will you take me back to Langley?

52:53.155 --> 52:55.059
It's an eight hour drive!

52:55.142 --> 52:57.809
Yeah, we can discuss the issue.
...Actually, I wouldn't mind

52:59.022 --> 53:02.442
To apologize to you for some of the things
I said to you when we were married

53:05.709 --> 53:06.926
They were blue

53:08.109 --> 53:10.393
And they had miraculous powers

53:11.076 --> 53:13.559
They came out of the water on the back of whales

53:14.576 --> 53:19.646
I killed three of them!
But they got up again

53:19.729 --> 53:22.859
I'd like to leave immediately to get our princess back

53:35.039 --> 53:36.193
...(Okoya)

53:36.276 --> 53:40.965
You will be stripped of the position of general of the armies of Wakanda

53:41.048 --> 53:44.493
And your role in the warrior squad

53:48.576 --> 53:49.876
...let me speak

53:49.942 --> 53:51.142
My queen.

53:52.176 --> 53:53.126
You can speak.

53:53.642 --> 53:55.142
Please.

53:57.297 --> 53:58.609
I gave my all!

53:59.709 --> 54:03.293
Allow me to die while I save my country and this throne

54:03.476 --> 54:05.559
I ask you this, mom

54:05.642 --> 54:07.593
Allow me to fix the situation

54:07.676 --> 54:08.926
Fix the situation?

54:10.542 --> 54:13.626
I don't know if my daughter is alive or dead

54:13.709 --> 54:17.493
We may be too hasty

54:19.076 --> 54:23.426
She raised a spear in her husband's face for Wakanda's sake

54:23.509 --> 54:26.293
And where is her cheating husband now?

54:26.376 --> 54:30.976
In a place where she can visit him if she wants
... My husband is me

54:31.942 --> 54:33.859
He is the company of the ancestors.

54:33.942 --> 54:38.742
I am the queen of the most powerful nation in the world

54:38.825 --> 54:42.142
And I lost my family until the last of its members

54:42.676 --> 54:46.059
Didn't I give my all?

54:54.942 --> 54:57.209
Stand up, General!

55:02.942 --> 55:09.093
I supported you after Killmonger took the throne

55:09.176 --> 55:12.897
And you and the elders of this chamber supported him

55:12.980 --> 55:16.676
While I'm running away, I beg for protection from the Jabari.

55:17.742 --> 55:22.259
I already warned you not to take my daughter on this mission

55:22.342 --> 55:24.409
and i lost it.

55:25.042 --> 55:26.209
...so today

55:27.509 --> 55:28.875
Kelly rash

56:15.809 --> 56:18.159
Do you hear me, Grio?

56:19.751 --> 56:20.726
Yes, my queen.

56:22.096 --> 56:25.293
Were you with Shuri when she was kidnapped?

56:25.376 --> 56:26.626
Yes.

56:26.709 --> 56:29.659
Can you trace her kimoyo beads?

56:29.742 --> 56:32.239
Ballistics found bullets
all over Cambridge

56:32.322 --> 56:35.126
The Wakandans really roamed the city

56:35.209 --> 56:40.009
I don't know how they found out that it was made by the machine!
As it is top secret information

56:43.742 --> 56:45.426
what is this? Is it a new ring? -
Shit.

56:46.894 --> 56:49.161
Excuse me, Director, I have to reply

56:49.244 --> 56:51.126
Stop with titles, reply, I don't care

56:51.209 --> 56:52.759
Hello my love.

56:54.042 --> 56:56.993
No, I'm with my boss now

56:57.923 --> 56:59.323
in fact, you will leave your boss.

56:59.406 --> 57:00.593
Good.

57:00.676 --> 57:03.226
I will work from home and then I will take a shower.

57:10.676 --> 57:11.893
(Everett Ross)

57:11.976 --> 57:13.059
Queen Raymonda?

57:13.142 --> 57:15.659
Why did you hold the kimoyu beads for Shuri?

57:15.742 --> 57:17.421
I didn't know it was her beads, okay?

57:17.504 --> 57:19.559
I found him at a very horrific crime scene

57:20.709 --> 57:21.726
Is the female student with you?

57:22.742 --> 57:25.559
Shuri was trying to save her when the
two of them were kidnapped

57:26.642 --> 57:27.926
What? Who kidnapped them?

57:29.609 --> 57:31.692
My agency assumes that you are the perpetrator

57:31.775 --> 57:36.026
And I'm afraid they realize that I've
guided Shuri and Aquai to the right path

57:36.109 --> 57:40.026
Look, if they're in danger, I want to help,
but I can't if I don't know what's going on

57:40.109 --> 57:43.392
I fear the emergence of new world powers on the scene

57:43.476 --> 57:46.459
Do you mean a country we know or another entity?

57:46.542 --> 57:48.326
This is all I can say for now

57:48.409 --> 57:49.442
I beg you.

57:50.115 --> 57:54.293
Alert me if your government decides to act
based on its suspicions

57:54.376 --> 57:55.509
Present, of course

57:56.376 --> 58:00.093
Listen, if I can
do something to help, tell me

58:00.176 --> 58:02.026
I owe Shuri my life

58:02.909 --> 58:06.576
Grio, was Shuri wearing her earrings?

58:07.209 --> 58:09.426
Lost track of them in the North Atlantic

58:09.509 --> 58:13.076
But her captors spoke
the Mayan language of the Yucatáns

58:16.386 --> 58:19.676
"(Cap-Haitien)"
"(Haiti)"

58:22.809 --> 58:23.809
Welcome.

58:30.376 --> 58:32.009
Did you come to see the headmistress?

58:39.342 --> 58:40.176
Here it is.

58:41.042 --> 58:42.876
Very well.

58:50.342 --> 58:51.175
Welcome.

58:57.309 --> 59:00.842
Please excuse us

59:05.476 --> 59:06.209
Welcome.

59:06.609 --> 59:07.209
Welcome.

59:07.276 --> 59:08.209
Welcome.

59:13.309 --> 59:14.476
Madam Queen Mother

59:16.176 --> 59:18.693
Everything here is a lesson for children

59:18.776 --> 59:22.093
They paint their walls and feed the fish

59:22.176 --> 59:24.493
and they grow everything we eat here.

59:24.576 --> 59:29.359
Some of the concepts here are familiar to me,
but you're using different materials

59:29.442 --> 59:32.626
Yeah, we only use the ones in Haiti

59:34.842 --> 59:38.042
We missed you at T'Challa's funeral

59:49.842 --> 59:51.059
Madam Queen Mother

59:51.142 --> 59:53.642
Six years have passed since we parted

59:54.309 --> 59:57.576
I thought you'd come back,
at least for the funeral

01:00:00.209 --> 01:00:01.609
…I was afraid

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:06.393
From the funeral put an end to the matter once and for all.

01:00:06.476 --> 01:00:09.442
...(Nakia), daughter (oh)

01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:14.442
You will always be a daughter of Wakanda wherever you go.

01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:19.059
And you know that death is not the end

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:24.942
Thanks.

01:00:29.742 --> 01:00:31.459
What's up with everyone at home?

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:33.826
Salience

01:00:34.693 --> 01:00:35.526
What?

01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:38.959
It has already infiltrated many nations

01:00:39.409 --> 01:00:41.376
that was a long time ago.

01:00:41.459 --> 01:00:42.759
I was a different person then

01:00:42.842 --> 01:00:48.809
I want someone who can find out where she's being held
and rescue her without anyone realizing he's there

01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:52.659
Who would risk a war with Wakanda?

01:00:54.783 --> 01:00:55.616
God!

01:00:55.699 --> 01:00:57.026
OK, breathe.

01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:58.959
Don't ask me to breathe

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:00.093
Where on earth are we?

01:01:00.176 --> 01:01:02.293
We are in a cave. I'm not sure where it is

01:01:02.376 --> 01:01:03.209
God!

01:01:03.709 --> 01:01:05.409
What is this?

01:01:05.492 --> 01:01:08.259
Glowing worms, their larvae are the source of light

01:01:09.409 --> 01:01:10.593
.just calm down

01:01:10.676 --> 01:01:13.993
Well, is there a new Black Panther
you can summon to come and get us?

01:01:14.076 --> 01:01:14.909
No.

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:16.242
Why not?

01:01:16.325 --> 01:01:17.893
Because it is not easy anymore.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.276
Black Panther is gone

01:01:20.842 --> 01:01:23.026
When I was kidnapped, you didn't have the Black Panther anymore?

01:01:28.542 --> 01:01:29.576
Oh princess.

01:01:30.709 --> 01:01:32.909
The members of the royal family here wear traditional clothes

01:01:33.276 --> 01:01:35.509
We made this for you.

01:01:36.142 --> 01:01:37.409
Do you understand it?

01:01:38.609 --> 01:01:39.959
Not exactly.

01:01:42.076 --> 01:01:42.976
No.

01:01:43.507 --> 01:01:45.959
This is supervillain stuff.

01:01:46.042 --> 01:01:47.376
It is present in all films

01:01:47.459 --> 01:01:48.793
Princess Leia.

01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:52.976
And Belle from "Beauty and the Beast,
" and that white girl in "Indiana Jones."

01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:54.143
There is nothing wrong.

01:01:54.226 --> 01:01:56.626
You'd be surprised if you saw what I had to wear to
the Warrior Falls festivities

01:02:03.076 --> 01:02:04.142
come with me.

01:02:05.216 --> 01:02:06.049
Hey

01:02:06.676 --> 01:02:09.206
You won't leave me here, right?

01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:10.225
I'll come back.

01:02:11.298 --> 01:02:12.476
I'll come back.

01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:14.493
Stay calm.

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:22.642
Do you eat

01:02:27.942 --> 01:02:30.959
Yucatan Peninsula
(Mexico)

01:02:37.076 --> 01:02:38.893
Hello ma'am. Nice to meet you.

01:02:38.976 --> 01:02:40.076
How do I help you?

01:02:41.376 --> 01:02:44.059
… My name is Maria Aldana. I am a student of Merida

01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:46.226
I do not care. Please leave.

01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:50.293
Yes of course. I don't mean to offend you
...just give me a moment.

01:02:50.742 --> 01:02:52.859
My teacher mentioned a study

01:02:52.942 --> 01:02:57.393
…in which you told the researchers that you saw something

01:02:58.276 --> 01:03:00.576
An unimaginable person

01:03:01.376 --> 01:03:04.059
No one comes better than talking to strangers.

01:03:04.142 --> 01:03:05.659
Please

01:03:05.742 --> 01:03:06.942
Go away. immediately

01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:10.742
I saw him as well.

01:03:22.176 --> 01:03:26.176
...we sometimes glimpsed a winged man

01:03:27.376 --> 01:03:29.109
on the beach…

01:03:29.776 --> 01:03:31.742
We thought it was a soul

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.142
The Kukulkan

01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:37.109
Our King, the Feathered Snake

01:03:37.809 --> 01:03:40.842
to this world and the underworld…

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:44.342
I want to go to this beach

01:03:45.442 --> 01:03:46.109
…I warn you

01:03:46.776 --> 01:03:52.642
The Kukulkan was there long before me and you

01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:54.959
Others searched for him

01:03:55.242 --> 01:03:56.942
…and they carry in their hearts evil intent

01:03:57.409 --> 01:03:58.342
and they never came back.

01:03:59.542 --> 01:04:01.076
...lost in the depths

01:04:02.476 --> 01:04:04.476
…forever

01:04:23.509 --> 01:04:24.509
Oh princess.

01:04:25.242 --> 01:04:26.226
Welcome.

01:04:28.176 --> 01:04:30.442
Please, take it easy

01:04:37.842 --> 01:04:39.175
It's beautiful.

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.509
It belonged to my mother.

01:04:52.009 --> 01:04:54.376
All artifacts from Central America

01:04:55.776 --> 01:04:57.659
Mostly from the 16th century

01:04:58.909 --> 01:05:01.093
Was I alive since then?

01:05:03.242 --> 01:05:04.593
Your mother was human

01:05:06.142 --> 01:05:07.059
right.

01:05:07.143 --> 01:05:09.109
Then I switched to something else

01:05:09.742 --> 01:05:11.626
How? -
How? -

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.659
The important thing is not how but why

01:05:16.476 --> 01:05:19.609
1571 AD
(Zama)
(Yucatan)

01:05:25.942 --> 01:05:32.376
My mother and the people of her village were forced to leave their farms
because of the Spanish invaders who brought smallpox with them.

01:05:33.156 --> 01:05:36.242
Hate language and church doctrine from another world

01:05:38.009 --> 01:05:41.526
They had to contend with famine, war and disease

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.793
He had them turn to Chuck

01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:48.142
Our god of rain and prosperity

01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:52.393
Who "chucked" the shaman with a vision

01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:55.376
A way to save his people

01:05:59.109 --> 01:06:03.459
Chuck shows him a plant growing on a blue stone

01:06:16.909 --> 01:06:21.676
My mother was pregnant with me at the time and refused to eat the plant

01:06:21.759 --> 01:06:23.926
for fear of what you might do to me.

01:06:24.442 --> 01:06:25.676
No. My baby.

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:27.866
But the shaman was in disguise

01:06:36.516 --> 01:06:38.483
Your child is ill

01:06:38.983 --> 01:06:40.749
Only this will cure him

01:06:41.216 --> 01:06:44.883
Your child will be the first born in our new home

01:06:46.449 --> 01:06:47.766
…Consider this gift as a promise

01:06:47.849 --> 01:06:51.383
That he will be our new king

01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:01.449
They all got sick

01:07:02.749 --> 01:07:04.083
...and their lives

01:07:04.916 --> 01:07:06.616
...and they are there

01:07:07.249 --> 01:07:08.300
is over.

01:07:20.216 --> 01:07:26.400
The plant stripped them of the ability to breathe land air.
It allowed them to take in oxygen from the sea

01:07:29.849 --> 01:07:31.549
They settled in the ocean

01:07:32.183 --> 01:07:35.233
away from war and diseases.

01:07:37.883 --> 01:07:39.049
Let's go!

01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:06.533
My mother gave birth to me there.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:10.100
And I became the first person to be born in Tallocan

01:08:10.816 --> 01:08:15.644
The plant provided me with winged ankles and ears
pointing towards the sky

01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:16.933
I was trans.

01:08:17.805 --> 01:08:21.200
I could swim in the sky.
My age slowed

01:08:21.283 --> 01:08:23.765
And you could breathe the air of our ancestors,

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:26.462
when you get old

01:08:28.049 --> 01:08:31.582
My mother was bemoaning the life
she knew before

01:08:33.483 --> 01:08:35.166
And she died of a broken heart

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:41.866
She made me promise to bury her in the soil of her homes

01:08:47.416 --> 01:08:50.283
I did not expect at all what I saw there

01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:58.283
whose son is this?

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:15.350
Fire!

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:16.817
Fire!

01:09:33.178 --> 01:09:34.584
You are a devil.

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.121
(Iblis' son)

01:09:36.203 --> 01:09:40.287
A faithful Spanish man cursed me as he died at my hands

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:42.125
...take care of

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.004
"El Niño Sin Amor"

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:48.871
The child is without love

01:09:49.904 --> 01:09:51.154
And from his words, I took my name

01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:57.543
(Neymore).

01:09:58.417 --> 01:10:01.337
Because my love for the surface world is non-existent.

01:10:03.337 --> 01:10:05.321
Why are you telling me all this?

01:10:06.971 --> 01:10:09.954
To understand why I have to kill the scientist

01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:11.588
What if we take her to Wakanda?

01:10:13.156 --> 01:10:14.390
We were released.

01:10:15.171 --> 01:10:18.221
I promise you will stay in my country.

01:10:18.305 --> 01:10:20.021
I can't risk it, Princess.

01:10:20.104 --> 01:10:21.571
So he kept me in her place

01:10:23.704 --> 01:10:25.504
I would like to see your nation.

01:10:26.837 --> 01:10:29.788
You can't go down to her in this.

01:10:31.804 --> 01:10:34.337
You will hypothermic at
about the same moment

01:10:35.304 --> 01:10:36.971
Your blood will be poisonous

01:10:37.604 --> 01:10:41.154
The pressure of the ocean will shatter every bone in your body

01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:45.488
or you can wear a suit.

01:10:46.071 --> 01:10:47.654
We have a number of them. come

01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:51.721
stay close to me.

01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:58.188
Hey, Neymore! wait

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:49.704
Name of the song: "Con La Brisa"
"Foudeqush: Name of the singer"

01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:12.342
(Talocan)
"Capital"

01:14:01.474 --> 01:14:02.621
Welcome.

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:32.871
This is beautiful.

01:14:34.171 --> 01:14:35.788
Made of vibranium

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:36.704
Yes.

01:14:36.787 --> 01:14:38.288
in the depths of the ocean

01:14:38.904 --> 01:14:41.204
I brought the sun to my people

01:14:43.137 --> 01:14:46.488
I know you wanted me not to kill the scientist

01:14:47.071 --> 01:14:49.037
But now you see what I have to protect

01:15:14.271 --> 01:15:16.221
Your hunch was right, Nakia

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:18.871
I located the two kimoyo earrings Shuri was
wearing

01:15:53.104 --> 01:15:55.188
The signal comes from an underwater cave

01:15:55.271 --> 01:15:58.754
At a depth of approximately 140 meters below the surface

01:15:59.437 --> 01:16:01.854
Queen Mother, I found her sign

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:04.071
issues from an underwater cave.

01:16:05.004 --> 01:16:07.654
If it's down
there, I'm sure I'll run into resistance

01:16:08.804 --> 01:16:10.737
How would you like me to act?

01:16:11.504 --> 01:16:15.471
Get back the princess by any means possible.

01:16:16.137 --> 01:16:19.221
I'm going to try to lure Naymore out

01:16:54.637 --> 01:16:57.404
You're the first person from the surface to come to Talocan

01:16:58.371 --> 01:17:00.354
Please take this as a token of our gratitude

01:17:07.737 --> 01:17:10.237
Made from the plant that saved Taloscan

01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:14.288
You are young, princess

01:17:15.404 --> 01:17:16.837
If you get old like me

01:17:17.504 --> 01:17:20.637
You realize that we all lose everyone we love

01:17:21.371 --> 01:17:24.371
But when I lost my brother, the feeling of losing him was different

01:17:24.871 --> 01:17:26.388
He suffered in silence

01:17:26.971 --> 01:17:29.537
And when he finally asked me for help, I
couldn't give it

01:17:31.571 --> 01:17:32.937
How is this reasonable?

01:17:33.737 --> 01:17:37.071
That the ancestors give me gifts and skills

01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:39.937
To help me save my brother, when I can't?

01:17:41.955 --> 01:17:42.788
Why?

01:17:45.437 --> 01:17:47.754
I do not have an answer to this question

01:17:50.037 --> 01:17:52.388
As my ancestors used to say

01:17:52.971 --> 01:17:56.188
Only the most broken people
can become great leaders

01:18:00.095 --> 01:18:02.004
I admire what you have built here

01:18:04.604 --> 01:18:06.837
How did you protect your people?

01:18:07.937 --> 01:18:13.321
But as the princess of Wakanda,
I wouldn't have that young woman killed

01:18:15.184 --> 01:18:18.104
My nation will not know rest until I am returned

01:18:19.704 --> 01:18:21.654
I wouldn't go without it

01:18:22.471 --> 01:18:26.121
We have to find a peaceful way to settle the situation

01:18:29.937 --> 01:18:31.488
The topic is no longer about the scientist

01:18:33.737 --> 01:18:37.837
For centuries surface nations have
conquered and enslaved people like us

01:18:38.771 --> 01:18:40.221
for resources.

01:18:41.771 --> 01:18:43.637
since the day my mother was buried

01:18:44.271 --> 01:18:47.888
And I am preparing my people for the time they come to invade us

01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:52.437
And that instrument is a sign that the time has come

01:18:54.404 --> 01:18:59.454
I must know if Wakanda is an ally or an enemy

01:19:00.204 --> 01:19:01.937
There is no room for a middle position

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:07.771
So you intend to wage war on the whole world

01:19:08.337 --> 01:19:10.471
And you want Wakanda to help you?

01:19:11.471 --> 01:19:12.588
This is madness.

01:19:13.172 --> 01:19:17.337
No nation would not be willing to pillage Wakanda
if given a chance

01:19:19.104 --> 01:19:20.723
If we form an alliance

01:19:20.806 --> 01:19:23.521
We will be able to protect each other by
attacking those nations first

01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:27.837
And then, after removing the threat of those nations

01:19:28.671 --> 01:19:31.054
The scientist will be returned to Wakanda

01:19:31.637 --> 01:19:34.288
And what will happen if you don't accept Wakanda?

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:37.104
The scientist will die

01:19:38.571 --> 01:19:41.254
Wakanda will be the first nation to fall

01:19:41.904 --> 01:19:43.021
An attack on my people?

01:19:43.604 --> 01:19:44.590
Yes.

01:19:45.304 --> 01:19:46.771
And I want you to listen to me

01:19:47.737 --> 01:19:50.571
Wakanda is unable to win
a war against the Taloscans

01:19:54.792 --> 01:19:56.809
…you have been called

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.126
Oh Kukulkan

01:20:02.459 --> 01:20:03.726
I heard you that night

01:20:04.792 --> 01:20:06.326
When you were with your mother near the river

01:20:07.985 --> 01:20:10.643
You said you wanted to set the world on fire

01:20:17.026 --> 01:20:18.759
Let's burn it together

01:20:26.992 --> 01:20:30.259
Central Intelligence Agency
(Langley, Virginia)

01:20:27.392 --> 01:20:30.543
Queen Raymonda refuses to sell us any vibranium

01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:33.755
Now they have kidnapped the young woman who made the machine

01:20:33.838 --> 01:20:36.843
Respectfully, Riri Williams is a child genius

01:20:36.926 --> 01:20:38.943
She was outperforming all of her teachers

01:20:39.026 --> 01:20:42.063
The Wakandans were recruiting her
into the outreach program they created

01:20:42.146 --> 01:20:46.276
No more, then you sent a SWAT team
under cover of darkness

01:20:46.359 --> 01:20:49.676
To arrest the crown princess of a superpower

01:20:52.992 --> 01:20:55.676
The President wants offensive action
against Wakanda

01:20:57.192 --> 01:20:58.909
What kind of offensive action?

01:20:59.492 --> 01:21:01.176
Destabilization.

01:21:02.626 --> 01:21:05.776
Special Officer Ross is our expert

01:21:05.859 --> 01:21:08.143
What do you think, Ross?

01:21:08.226 --> 01:21:10.976
My sources tell me there is another party involved

01:21:12.059 --> 01:21:13.909
another nation? -
Maybe, I don't know.

01:21:13.992 --> 01:21:16.376
You must give me enough time to
investigate this properly

01:21:16.459 --> 01:21:22.309
Otherwise, we will find ourselves in a war against a country.
We are unable even to comprehend its military capabilities

01:21:24.026 --> 01:21:24.909
What's the director?

01:21:25.626 --> 01:21:28.009
He is the expert in my opinion.

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:30.709
Attacking "Wakanda" would be a mistake, in my opinion

01:21:38.169 --> 01:21:39.643
yes? -
We have a problem.

01:21:40.859 --> 01:21:42.992
"(Coral Filho)"
"(Cape Verde)"

01:22:01.392 --> 01:22:03.292
Is my daughter alive?

01:22:03.892 --> 01:22:05.826
The princess is alive and well.

01:22:06.326 --> 01:22:09.276
She asked to be taken to Tallocan

01:22:09.359 --> 01:22:11.826
and will remain there for the time being.

01:22:15.559 --> 01:22:18.543
What can I offer you for her return?

01:22:19.359 --> 01:22:20.470
No thing.

01:22:20.553 --> 01:22:22.276
I have a different opinion.

01:22:22.375 --> 01:22:28.508
The Americans are preparing to hold Wakanda
responsible for your attack on their exploration ship

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:35.492
I promise my daughter and the scientist, or I will tell them you exist

01:22:42.147 --> 01:22:44.325
If you tell the Americans about us

01:22:46.075 --> 01:22:48.242
Or try to find us,

01:22:49.108 --> 01:22:52.675
or discovered a single Wakandan ship in the ocean

01:22:53.775 --> 01:22:55.125
I will kill the princess

01:22:56.708 --> 01:23:00.475
I will come to Wakanda and kill you

01:23:10.075 --> 01:23:10.959
So what happened?

01:23:12.875 --> 01:23:17.775
He wants to go to war against the surface world.
He asked me to help him

01:23:22.642 --> 01:23:23.775
for thinking.

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.525
We will never get out of here

01:23:38.842 --> 01:23:40.159
Armi Ramhak

01:23:40.242 --> 01:23:41.842
Kill the princess!

01:23:47.842 --> 01:23:49.275
Army Skink.

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:50.675
…You are

01:23:51.442 --> 01:23:52.642
You are the reason to kill her

01:23:53.437 --> 01:23:54.808
...leave it

01:23:54.936 --> 01:23:56.992
I don't have to kill you

01:24:00.008 --> 01:24:00.841
(noise)

01:24:01.908 --> 01:24:03.542
Move your left arm

01:24:08.108 --> 01:24:09.192
Are you well?

01:24:10.008 --> 01:24:11.359
Are you well?

01:24:11.442 --> 01:24:12.992
Give me your beads! -
Let's go!

01:24:13.075 --> 01:24:15.592
Give me your beads. I can save her. -
We have to go.

01:24:15.675 --> 01:24:18.059
Shuri, I don't know who this lady is,
but we have to hear what she has to say

01:24:18.142 --> 01:24:21.642
Look, I hit her with a sonic boom . And
it's deadly from this distance. can not survive

01:24:21.725 --> 01:24:23.659
You do not understand. This will lead to war.

01:24:23.742 --> 01:24:26.192
We have to go!
- Hey!

01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:10.925
did they hurt you

01:25:11.008 --> 01:25:12.642
No.

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:15.192
Thank you.

01:25:15.975 --> 01:25:17.225
You are welcome.

01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:20.059
"Grio" -
Yes, my queen? -

01:25:20.142 --> 01:25:22.025
Take us back to Wakanda right now

01:25:25.908 --> 01:25:27.808
What happened, my daughter?

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.608
Wakandis.

01:25:32.308 --> 01:25:34.175
They came to take her

01:25:36.842 --> 01:25:38.808
...Oh Kukulkan

01:25:41.242 --> 01:25:44.775
can you save me

01:25:58.042 --> 01:25:59.508
did she die

01:26:01.808 --> 01:26:02.975
Yes.

01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:13.975
Relax, my daughter

01:26:16.442 --> 01:26:17.908
…they came

01:26:18.308 --> 01:26:22.342
while you were talking to the queen?

01:26:23.675 --> 01:26:27.175
We should not have trusted her.

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:30.875
The princess saw our home

01:26:31.275 --> 01:26:33.542
What is stopping them

01:26:33.908 --> 01:26:36.108
Than they'd come and attack the Taloscans?

01:26:38.275 --> 01:26:39.642
I will stop them.

01:27:14.375 --> 01:27:15.908
Get up, Taloscan!

01:27:18.342 --> 01:27:20.042
Get up, Taloscan!

01:27:25.275 --> 01:27:27.375
He blinded me

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:28.908
Hope

01:27:29.008 --> 01:27:30.808
In establishing a partnership.

01:27:32.642 --> 01:27:33.708
...and has

01:27:34.275 --> 01:27:36.575
You put us in danger

01:27:37.108 --> 01:27:39.308
all of us.

01:27:40.008 --> 01:27:41.208
"Talocan"

01:27:41.575 --> 01:27:43.125
It will not change its location

01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:44.675
once again.

01:27:45.675 --> 01:27:46.642
(Namura)

01:27:47.808 --> 01:27:48.525
(Atoma).

01:27:50.675 --> 01:27:53.775
When we dump them

01:27:56.608 --> 01:27:59.025
They will never think

01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:01.225
in approaching

01:28:01.308 --> 01:28:02.842
from "Talocan."

01:28:05.142 --> 01:28:06.575
Get up, Taloscan!

01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:21.459
We're glad you're back, Princess

01:28:21.542 --> 01:28:23.975
The city is in tension since you left

01:28:24.775 --> 01:28:25.790
Come on.

01:28:25.873 --> 01:28:28.625
Reinforce sound barriers
on all waterways

01:28:28.708 --> 01:28:29.541
Oh princess?

01:28:30.475 --> 01:28:31.308
(Nika).

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.625
Thank the ancestors

01:28:36.308 --> 01:28:39.108
I just wanted to bring those two back.

01:28:40.042 --> 01:28:42.692
No, keep them

01:28:42.775 --> 01:28:44.342
They may need you soon

01:28:45.175 --> 01:28:47.125
Did you get this from below?

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:53.425
Is it true that you saw an empire under the waters?

01:28:54.875 --> 01:28:55.708
Yes.

01:28:57.230 --> 01:28:58.675
She is beautiful.

01:29:00.175 --> 01:29:02.592
But these people are dangerous, Anika.

01:29:23.075 --> 01:29:25.525
So, Miss Riri Williams

01:29:26.608 --> 01:29:28.592
What do you think of "Wakanda"?

01:29:29.175 --> 01:29:31.342
Stories don't do justice to this place

01:29:33.942 --> 01:29:34.925
It's a great.

01:29:35.508 --> 01:29:37.475
But I really want to go home.

01:29:38.242 --> 01:29:39.759
You have to be patient

01:29:40.342 --> 01:29:41.959
Can I at least call my mom?

01:29:48.475 --> 01:29:51.692
Veteran Nakia
has brought the princess home

01:29:52.275 --> 01:29:53.559
(Glory be to Hanuman.)

01:29:53.642 --> 01:29:54.942
(Glory be to Hanuman.)

01:29:56.208 --> 01:29:59.175
The spy saved "Wakanda" again

01:30:00.242 --> 01:30:03.875
The Queen must reward her
with banishment for life

01:30:06.743 --> 01:30:07.915
(Okoya).

01:30:10.508 --> 01:30:11.608
Thank you my sister.

01:30:13.935 --> 01:30:17.592
After Thanos attacked,
when you left without saying anything

01:30:18.342 --> 01:30:19.375
it hurt me.

01:30:23.342 --> 01:30:26.508
I regret not being with you all.

01:30:28.342 --> 01:30:29.425
It wasn't easy

01:30:30.392 --> 01:30:31.225
…It was

01:30:32.042 --> 01:30:35.725
King and Black Panther, for everyone

01:30:36.608 --> 01:30:37.992
...but for me

01:30:44.548 --> 01:30:46.115
The world and what is in it

01:30:48.155 --> 01:30:49.655
Dear T'Challa

01:30:51.208 --> 01:30:54.342
When it was taken away from me so suddenly

01:30:55.142 --> 01:30:56.808
I had to walk away

01:30:57.748 --> 01:30:59.748
.and give myself a chance to deal with my brokenness

01:31:02.042 --> 01:31:03.475
…I simply couldn't

01:31:04.442 --> 01:31:07.492
To continue my life as if nothing had happened

01:31:25.526 --> 01:31:26.359
We are under attack

01:31:34.208 --> 01:31:35.075
.Catch

01:31:42.142 --> 01:31:43.075
Take care of this

01:31:44.075 --> 01:31:45.659
Are you well? did you get hurt?

01:31:45.742 --> 01:31:47.659
Turn on the Sunbird, Grew

01:31:47.742 --> 01:31:49.492
Where are you, Shuri?

01:31:49.575 --> 01:31:50.659
I'm heading to town right now

01:31:50.742 --> 01:31:52.275
!stay where you are! it's a command

01:31:52.358 --> 01:31:54.692
I'm with Anika, Mama.
We can provide air support

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:57.525
Don't let her leave the lab, Anika.
-Your voice breaks, Mama.

01:31:57.608 --> 01:31:58.592
We can't hear you!
(Shuri)!

01:31:58.675 --> 01:31:59.508
I love you! Farewell.

01:32:01.875 --> 01:32:02.992
Hung up on the Queen.

01:32:03.075 --> 01:32:04.159
in the face of my mother.

01:32:04.242 --> 01:32:05.792
There is a difference. Come on, let's go!

01:32:38.342 --> 01:32:40.092
Raiders!

01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:48.608
Mom!

01:32:51.842 --> 01:32:53.442
Lancaster! Steder

01:32:57.342 --> 01:33:00.225
Paramedics are subjected to
a form of vocal hypnosis

01:33:02.942 --> 01:33:04.108
Take the child

01:33:04.191 --> 01:33:06.159
Close your ears, General

01:33:06.242 --> 01:33:07.259
I command you, my queen

01:33:53.675 --> 01:33:55.842
can i help? -
Come on, quickly.

01:34:02.708 --> 01:34:04.225
What a warrior!

01:34:06.375 --> 01:34:07.592
Cross your arms.

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:08.225
Son...

01:34:13.508 --> 01:34:14.092
(Nakia)

01:34:14.175 --> 01:34:15.175
Yes.

01:34:15.642 --> 01:34:16.642
We'll find your mom, okay?

01:34:28.575 --> 01:34:29.908
The man the fish.

01:34:34.175 --> 01:34:36.908
We lured the defenses away from the palace

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:39.159
The rest is up to you

01:35:58.275 --> 01:35:58.908
Call for help!

01:35:59.808 --> 01:36:00.275
Call for help!

01:36:18.142 --> 01:36:20.059
Die. He's very fast. -
And faster in the water.

01:36:46.208 --> 01:36:47.659
I enable system bypass procedures.

01:36:47.742 --> 01:36:50.325
Wait! I'll fix it!
- I can't leave you here, Shuri!

01:37:07.175 --> 01:37:08.192
Do you see it

01:37:08.275 --> 01:37:09.659
Yeah, it's there

01:37:23.642 --> 01:37:24.475
Go, my daughter

01:37:25.442 --> 01:37:27.159
Hey, what? and leave you here?

01:37:27.242 --> 01:37:28.225
Run!

01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:44.325
Move now, Okoya!

01:38:45.275 --> 01:38:46.008
Help the girl

01:38:52.008 --> 01:38:53.059
This happened because of her

01:38:57.316 --> 01:39:01.159
I'll be back in a week with my whole army

01:39:01.242 --> 01:39:04.425
And you will join us to battle the surface world

01:39:05.008 --> 01:39:07.559
Or I'll wipe Wakanda off the face of the earth

01:39:08.575 --> 01:39:09.475
Come on, my queen

01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:11.525
Mom.

01:39:12.108 --> 01:39:13.692
Keep her back!
- Mom!

01:39:13.776 --> 01:39:14.621
Mom!

01:39:14.704 --> 01:39:15.775
Bury your dead

01:39:17.681 --> 01:39:19.092
And grieve for those you lost

01:39:22.508 --> 01:39:23.959
you became the queen.

01:39:24.042 --> 01:39:25.192
Mom!

01:39:26.042 --> 01:39:26.992
No!

01:39:30.342 --> 01:39:31.592
Get away from me! Mom!

01:39:32.375 --> 01:39:34.225
Mom!

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:42.592
Mom!

01:39:43.175 --> 01:39:44.408
Mom!

01:39:45.142 --> 01:39:46.508
Mom!

01:39:47.075 --> 01:39:47.925
Wake up my queen

01:39:50.142 --> 01:39:51.342
I will see.

01:39:52.042 --> 01:39:52.875
Wake up.

01:39:53.742 --> 01:39:54.875
Help me!

01:39:55.475 --> 01:39:56.692
Mom!

01:40:00.208 --> 01:40:01.359
Wake up, mom

01:40:02.042 --> 01:40:03.342
She passed away

01:40:04.203 --> 01:40:05.468
Mom!

01:40:47.142 --> 01:40:52.159
Condolences from the land of Jabari for your loss.

01:40:58.942 --> 01:41:04.608
You must inherit it in line with the rituals of your ancestors

01:41:06.708 --> 01:41:08.459
Don't concern yourself with your techniques

01:41:08.542 --> 01:41:09.742
Why are you here?

01:41:11.775 --> 01:41:17.508
I promised your brother that I would give you advice and protection

01:41:20.108 --> 01:41:22.142
But I need your advice today.

01:41:26.108 --> 01:41:29.642
The elders of your tribe came to me with a proposal

01:41:31.175 --> 01:41:35.959
They want to evacuate the city
and set up camp on the Jabari land

01:41:36.542 --> 01:41:39.142
I want to hear a little girl's point of view

01:41:40.242 --> 01:41:41.492
Make fun of tradition?

01:41:45.875 --> 01:41:47.108
...the world

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:51.275
The world has taken so much from you

01:41:52.308 --> 01:41:55.292
You can't be considered a little girl anymore

01:41:58.608 --> 01:42:02.859
It is in the interest of my people to know which option you prefer

01:42:04.875 --> 01:42:06.342
The elders are desperate

01:42:08.308 --> 01:42:09.975
The city is in a weak position

01:42:12.375 --> 01:42:14.402
If you help them

01:42:15.542 --> 01:42:17.759
They will owe you a lot

01:42:20.004 --> 01:42:21.494
And what about your heart?

01:42:25.281 --> 01:42:27.825
What is your heart inclined to?

01:42:29.075 --> 01:42:31.975
I just buried the last person who knew me well

01:42:35.442 --> 01:42:37.175
My heart is buried with her

01:43:14.175 --> 01:43:15.025
Oh my God!

01:43:15.942 --> 01:43:17.959
Yes, your olive oil is about to spoil

01:43:18.042 --> 01:43:19.092
What are you doing here?

01:43:19.175 --> 01:43:21.825
...I'm hungry, and besides

01:43:22.508 --> 01:43:24.459
Tragedy befell the international community

01:43:24.542 --> 01:43:29.125
Sources can now confirm the
death of Queen Raymonda, daughter of Lumumba

01:43:29.208 --> 01:43:33.475
The Western Allies say that civil strife
...was the most likely cause of the Queen's death

01:43:35.908 --> 01:43:38.375
So, do you have any comments?

01:43:40.342 --> 01:43:43.459
I wonder what your friends are
hiding from you other than this.

01:43:44.308 --> 01:43:45.554
what are you talking about

01:43:45.637 --> 01:43:48.992
I have no unauthorized contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda

01:43:51.608 --> 01:43:53.559
What about the beads?

01:43:54.975 --> 01:43:55.825
What?

01:43:55.908 --> 01:43:56.992
Beads.

01:43:57.075 --> 01:44:00.259
You asked for a wiretap to be put
in there before you even got there

01:44:00.342 --> 01:44:04.226
I was privy to every conversation you had

01:44:04.309 --> 01:44:07.082
Including that call,
in which she committed treason with the Queen

01:44:07.165 --> 01:44:08.442
May you rest in peace

01:44:09.208 --> 01:44:11.459
but that's good, good for us at least.

01:44:11.542 --> 01:44:14.225
Do you know? The Wakandans saved my life

01:44:14.908 --> 01:44:16.392
They are good people

01:44:16.475 --> 01:44:19.975
Have you thought a little about what they could do?

01:44:20.701 --> 01:44:22.044
Have you thought about what we were going to do?

01:44:22.127 --> 01:44:25.125
If the United States were the only country
in the world with vibranium?

01:44:26.522 --> 01:44:29.855
I really dream about it.

01:44:32.508 --> 01:44:34.192
Val, please, Val.

01:44:34.775 --> 01:44:36.359
You should call me Principal de Fontaine

01:44:39.208 --> 01:44:42.542
Your mother protected me as if I were one of her children

01:44:43.708 --> 01:44:45.959
The least I can do is try to return the favor

01:44:48.575 --> 01:44:50.792
We have to find a way to weaken Naymore

01:44:50.875 --> 01:44:52.992
He will still be a problem even if we weaken him

01:44:53.608 --> 01:44:56.592
Black Panther never failed
to protect Wakanda

01:44:57.575 --> 01:44:59.325
Didn't you say Black Panther is gone?

01:45:09.428 --> 01:45:10.528
My brother is gone

01:45:12.275 --> 01:45:14.725
But this does not mean that the "Black Panther" will leave with him.

01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:33.494
Greo?

01:45:34.308 --> 01:45:40.808
Let's start by doing a comparative analysis
of our attempts at making an artificial heartworm

01:45:43.508 --> 01:45:45.342
the fibers of this bracelet.

01:45:46.075 --> 01:45:47.275
It's up to you, princess

01:45:50.408 --> 01:45:53.408
Since these were grown
from soil rich in vibranium

01:45:54.602 --> 01:45:58.042
There may be similarities between them that we can exploit
at the lowest level

01:45:58.125 --> 01:45:59.408
As you wish, princess.

01:46:03.675 --> 01:46:06.125
Upload my brother's DNA too please.

01:46:06.208 --> 01:46:07.292
Uploading.

01:46:08.942 --> 01:46:11.359
"Alone: ​​the name of the song"
"Burna Boy: the name of the singer"

01:46:38.875 --> 01:46:40.292
Why don't they look like them?

01:46:40.375 --> 01:46:42.785
His body characteristics are completely different.

01:46:42.868 --> 01:46:45.392
None of them fly or have pointed ears like him.

01:46:46.108 --> 01:46:49.375
The women guarding
us put water on their mouths and necks.

01:46:50.026 --> 01:46:50.859
He wasn't putting it on.

01:46:50.942 --> 01:46:56.272
There are many organisms that don't need gills
...to extract oxygen from water, so...

01:46:56.355 --> 01:46:58.425
Like a jellyfish.

01:46:58.508 --> 01:47:02.342
It only absorbs oxygen through its skin.

01:47:03.734 --> 01:47:05.808
It's a process called diffusion.
Diffusion.

01:47:30.075 --> 01:47:34.859
Every day that passes without us choosing a ruler is a
wasted day.

01:47:34.942 --> 01:47:38.059
We have to deal with Naymore before
he brings his warriors back here.

01:47:38.142 --> 01:47:40.759
How do we deal with a man who has so much power?

01:47:41.842 --> 01:47:44.759
In that attack before he shot down your plane, he
jumped back into the water.

01:47:44.842 --> 01:47:46.659
Could he derive strength from her?

01:47:47.242 --> 01:47:50.542
It breathes air and gets oxygen
from the water on its skin.

01:47:51.042 --> 01:47:53.792
It won't stay as strong
if we figure out a way to dry it.

01:47:54.375 --> 01:47:55.425
I found it.

01:47:55.508 --> 01:47:56.425
"Grio"

01:47:56.508 --> 01:48:00.292
We have to convert the Royal Tylon into
a vaporization chamber.

01:48:00.375 --> 01:48:01.559
Is this even possible?

01:48:01.642 --> 01:48:02.675
Yes.

01:48:04.508 --> 01:48:06.292
You're going to help us trap him and hold him.

01:48:07.108 --> 01:48:09.392
Please direct Miss Williams
to her workplace.

01:48:09.475 --> 01:48:10.675
Come to me from here.

01:48:15.075 --> 01:48:17.492
How old were you when you made your first instrument?

01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:18.559
Three years.

01:48:18.642 --> 01:48:22.159
My stepfather was an auto mechanic, and
he wanted to build airplanes

01:48:22.242 --> 01:48:24.692
He gave me tools and let me work on making them

01:48:28.614 --> 01:48:30.892
So who taught you to do everything you do?

01:48:30.975 --> 01:48:32.492
my old brother.

01:48:35.542 --> 01:48:38.992
I was the spearhead of the Wakanda army

01:48:39.075 --> 01:48:41.425
This does not suit me at all.

01:48:42.008 --> 01:48:44.308
Then I became a civilian

01:48:45.442 --> 01:48:46.559
Weapon safety

01:48:47.242 --> 01:48:48.825
I made you a new spear, too

01:48:50.842 --> 01:48:51.692
A new pike?

01:48:51.775 --> 01:48:52.925
Yes.

01:48:54.474 --> 01:48:56.737
What's the name of this contraption anyway?

01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.259
"Midnight Angel"

01:48:58.343 --> 01:48:59.525
Midnight Angel?

01:48:59.975 --> 01:49:01.725
Listen to me, Okoya.

01:49:03.175 --> 01:49:04.992
This will equal our palms when facing them.

01:49:05.075 --> 01:49:07.808
I want you to be ready when I
call you, sister.

01:49:09.721 --> 01:49:10.741
I beg you.

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.373
(noise)

01:49:17.298 --> 01:49:18.131
Yes?

01:49:19.908 --> 01:49:21.742
How many of these did you make?

01:49:23.725 --> 01:49:25.725
I looked for you in the Jabari barracks.

01:49:25.808 --> 01:49:27.425
I refuse to be forced to leave my home.

01:49:27.509 --> 01:49:30.159
You have a rebellious spirit to the extreme.

01:49:30.242 --> 01:49:31.659
Why did you join the warrior squad?

01:49:32.775 --> 01:49:33.892
Why do you care?

01:49:41.342 --> 01:49:43.659
I still have a great desire to fight.

01:49:44.481 --> 01:49:47.259
Tell me, Anika, Kiana's daughter.

01:49:48.005 --> 01:49:50.125
Do you still have a desire to fight?

01:49:50.208 --> 01:49:53.059
What do you think?

01:50:17.575 --> 01:50:18.475
"Grio"

01:50:20.068 --> 01:50:21.675
What is the success rate?

01:50:22.275 --> 01:50:24.308
It's 98.7 percent, princess.

01:50:24.875 --> 01:50:27.442
Would you like me to print the herb heart-shaped?

01:50:31.333 --> 01:50:33.817
Hello, Shuri

01:50:34.566 --> 01:50:36.850
I expected you to be back in Haiti
by this time.

01:50:38.133 --> 01:50:39.483
I'm still Wakandan, for your information.

01:50:43.825 --> 01:50:44.658
…if

01:50:46.033 --> 01:50:48.783
that's what you've been working on.

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:50.883
Yes.

01:50:50.966 --> 01:50:52.900
What you have here and now.

01:50:54.133 --> 01:50:58.233
It's an opportunity to take back the protector of Wakanda.

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:03.533
It will be the greatest gift.

01:51:04.366 --> 01:51:06.583
Since the discovery of Basinga.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.817
We'll find out soon. come.

01:51:17.133 --> 01:51:18.917
"Grio" -
Yes, princess? -

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.133
Print it.

01:51:23.933 --> 01:51:25.766
How will we know whether it succeeded or not?

01:51:26.433 --> 01:51:27.650
If it glows.

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.033
You passed!

01:51:42.966 --> 01:51:45.150
Shouldn't we light incense or something?

01:51:46.033 --> 01:51:49.266
Bast, I know how the ancestors
got to this lab.

01:51:59.459 --> 01:52:01.342
Are you sure you don't want me to bury you?

01:52:01.425 --> 01:52:02.399
I do not want.

01:52:03.033 --> 01:52:05.176
I want you to be able to reach my chest.

01:52:05.259 --> 01:52:07.117
In anticipation of a heart attack.

01:52:07.873 --> 01:52:09.273
Heart failure?

01:52:10.517 --> 01:52:11.350
She's kidding.

01:52:12.273 --> 01:52:13.106
Right?

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.033
Right?

01:52:21.333 --> 01:52:24.633
Allow this herb to be heart-shaped.

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:28.350
By empowering you with the power of the Black Panther.

01:52:29.033 --> 01:52:31.717
And it takes you to the Isthmus of the Ancestors.

01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.133
"Raymonda"

01:52:35.466 --> 01:52:40.533
We beg you to come to your daughter.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:05.983
(engadaca)

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.050
My little cousin.

01:54:08.133 --> 01:54:09.183
How?

01:54:09.266 --> 01:54:12.017
The important thing is not how but why, right?

01:54:13.866 --> 01:54:15.050
You chose me.

01:54:15.133 --> 01:54:18.217
No way, I would never have chosen you.

01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:20.166
Why did you take the herb?

01:54:20.966 --> 01:54:22.917
To see my family. -
No, that's nonsense.

01:54:23.966 --> 01:54:26.850
You didn't believe the "isthmus of the ancestors" was real, did you?

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.317
I couldn't believe it.

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:32.983
Why did you take it?

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:36.166
You don't need to lie to me

01:54:37.033 --> 01:54:38.417
to be strong.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.917
Strong for what purpose?

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.233
Did you come?

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.700
We are more alike than you think.

01:54:49.733 --> 01:54:51.650
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

01:54:51.733 --> 01:54:53.300
We are not alike at all.

01:54:54.466 --> 01:54:57.966
You took it for yourself.
Then you destroyed what was left of it

01:54:59.233 --> 01:55:00.450
An unworthy king.

01:55:01.366 --> 01:55:03.317
Afraid of being replaced.

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:04.883
Just a coward.

01:55:04.966 --> 01:55:06.267
No.

01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:08.783
I had the courage
to do what was necessary to change Wakanda.

01:55:10.233 --> 01:55:14.183
How many people like yours did I protect in Wakanda
before I ascended the throne?

01:55:15.566 --> 01:55:18.833
Cowards. Such were the Panthers
before me.

01:55:19.666 --> 01:55:20.750
And before T'Challa

01:55:20.833 --> 01:55:22.650
don't mention my brother.

01:55:22.733 --> 01:55:24.650
He's dead because of you.

01:55:25.233 --> 01:55:28.200
It burned the herb, leaving us bare.

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.950
Then Naymore attacked us and killed my mom.

01:55:31.033 --> 01:55:32.817
You are responsible for their death.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.317
No, I don't take responsibility for that.

01:55:36.166 --> 01:55:39.166
And don't underestimate your mother's role.

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:42.900
She sacrificed her life to protect a young woman from the
lost tribe.

01:55:44.476 --> 01:55:47.139
Your father was a hypocrite.

01:55:48.572 --> 01:55:50.105
If he were alive, he would have killed that girl.

01:55:51.079 --> 01:55:52.866
He didn't even shy away from killing his brother.

01:55:54.526 --> 01:55:57.126
T'Challa was an exaggerated nobleman.

01:55:59.259 --> 01:56:01.866
The man who killed your father was allowed to live.

01:56:03.729 --> 01:56:05.866
And here you are standing.

01:56:11.078 --> 01:56:13.283
Will you be as noble as your brother?

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.333
Or will you do what needs to be done.

01:56:16.378 --> 01:56:17.250
Like me?

01:56:20.212 --> 01:56:21.312
Are you well?

01:56:23.266 --> 01:56:24.533
Are you well?

01:56:27.066 --> 01:56:28.050
Who did you see?

01:56:33.724 --> 01:56:34.557
No one.

01:56:37.833 --> 01:56:38.783
What is going on?

01:56:39.533 --> 01:56:42.100
Failed. It didn't work.

01:56:42.184 --> 01:56:43.150
Oh Shuri

01:56:46.266 --> 01:56:47.183
They abandoned me.

01:56:47.266 --> 01:56:48.787
They never would have done that

01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:51.650
I did everything I was supposed to do. I
remade the herb.

01:56:51.733 --> 01:56:52.566
Good.

01:56:52.649 --> 01:56:54.417
You just did your silly ritual and what did you get?

01:56:54.501 --> 01:56:56.017
Calm down.
Why didn't they come for me? -

01:56:56.101 --> 01:56:57.600
Just calm down.

01:57:04.666 --> 01:57:06.117
Wow!

01:57:10.033 --> 01:57:11.633
May I have some too?

01:57:18.866 --> 01:57:19.933
…I suspect

01:57:21.433 --> 01:57:22.683
that you will need a suit.

01:57:54.533 --> 01:57:56.656
More people come from the city

01:57:56.739 --> 01:57:58.250
they need more space.

01:57:58.333 --> 01:57:59.183
So what?

01:58:00.266 --> 01:58:02.383
You are visitors

01:58:02.466 --> 01:58:06.100
It's amazing how anything can be accomplished with you guys

01:58:31.636 --> 01:58:33.083
the princess!

01:59:06.366 --> 01:59:07.800
I succeeded!

01:59:08.568 --> 01:59:11.650
Black Panther comes back to life!

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.866
Naymore thinks Wakanda is in a weak state

01:59:34.546 --> 01:59:36.093
...our queen has been killed

01:59:38.426 --> 01:59:40.093
And our capital is destroyed.

01:59:41.652 --> 01:59:43.619
He thinks we are immortal.

01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:46.500
…but now

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.083
This is the time to attack.

01:59:50.166 --> 01:59:54.350
How come we don't even know how to find it?

01:59:54.433 --> 01:59:56.250
We'll bring Naymore to us

01:59:56.333 --> 01:59:57.817
here again? -
No.

01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.783
But to a remote location in the sea.

02:00:00.866 --> 02:00:01.699
Good.

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.700
Suppose we succeed in this

02:00:05.866 --> 02:00:07.817
assuming we can kill this guy.

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:11.033
Who can fly and can be as powerful as the Hulk.

02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.883
Would killing him be the right solution?

02:00:16.566 --> 02:00:20.917
You were calling for his death,
when his only crime was intimidation

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.750
What has changed, Lord Embaco?

02:00:22.833 --> 02:00:23.966
His soldiers.

02:00:24.466 --> 02:00:28.883
They didn't call him General or King,
they called him Kukulkan.

02:00:28.966 --> 02:00:30.117
And what is this name?

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.417
Feathered serpent deity.

02:00:33.266 --> 02:00:34.166
What?

02:00:34.249 --> 02:00:38.117
Do you think books are not available to us
because we live in the mountains?

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:39.883
Elders!

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:45.550
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to speak to Lord Embaco in private

02:00:46.966 --> 02:00:47.566
Yes.

02:00:48.133 --> 02:00:48.933
Yes.

02:00:55.733 --> 02:00:57.017
Neymore isn't done yet.

02:00:58.566 --> 02:01:01.683
He promised to destroy the surface world

02:01:01.766 --> 02:01:04.223
Now is our chance to defeat him.

02:01:04.306 --> 02:01:06.417
What are you afraid of? -
War. -

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.217
If the people of Naymor really see him as a god,
we risk eternal war if we kill him.

02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:14.183
So what?

02:01:14.866 --> 02:01:17.386
Wasn't my mother's life worth perpetual war?

02:01:17.469 --> 02:01:18.617
Definitely deserve it.

02:01:19.733 --> 02:01:23.700
She definitely deserves it.

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:29.333
But when the war is what you want for you.

02:01:34.556 --> 02:01:36.473
War is not what I want.

02:01:38.666 --> 02:01:40.366
Not what I want for my people.

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.850
She talks about my mom as if she's still with us.

02:01:54.833 --> 02:01:56.750
She talks about what she would want for me.

02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:00.300
About her hopes and dreams.

02:02:03.366 --> 02:02:04.783
But she is dead

02:02:06.033 --> 02:02:07.383
trip

02:02:08.666 --> 02:02:12.417
Naymore drowned her before my eyes

02:02:13.866 --> 02:02:18.733
…Her dreams, goals and hopes are mine

02:02:21.932 --> 02:02:23.159
Does not exist.

02:02:25.766 --> 02:02:27.700
No longer important.

02:02:29.466 --> 02:02:32.417
What matters is what I want.

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:35.300
And what I want is to see Neymore dead

02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.650
And you will help me get what I want

02:02:48.266 --> 02:02:49.500
is this clear?

02:02:57.099 --> 02:02:58.366
We will leave in the morning

02:03:24.433 --> 02:03:25.617
Welcome.

02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:26.533
Good morning.

02:03:28.933 --> 02:03:30.533
In case we survive this.

02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:35.250
Know that you have a home with me in Haiti

02:03:38.133 --> 02:03:40.900
Look. Hold my hand.

02:03:43.733 --> 02:03:44.717
Breathing.

02:03:49.426 --> 02:03:51.717
I need you to be honest with me, Shuri.

02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:54.817
Who did you see when you took the herb?

02:03:59.966 --> 02:04:01.783
If you go to war for revenge.

02:04:01.866 --> 02:04:04.433
It will not fill the emptiness
you feel from her loss.

02:04:05.054 --> 02:04:06.717
It will only cause it to increase

02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:08.350
and it will possess you.

02:04:10.666 --> 02:04:12.100
Own me and it's over.

02:04:17.366 --> 02:04:24.083
Hey, Kukulkan, another instrument is being used to
detect vibranium in the ocean

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:26.150
where?

02:04:28.166 --> 02:04:31.200
"Atlantic Ocean"

02:04:55.466 --> 02:04:56.800
Get out of the water!

02:05:14.118 --> 02:05:15.217
Sit tight!

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:16.450
Sit tight!

02:05:16.533 --> 02:05:17.517
Sit tight!

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:18.550
Sit tight!

02:05:18.633 --> 02:05:19.466
Sit tight!

02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:20.383
Sit tight!

02:05:20.467 --> 02:05:21.594
Sit tight!

02:05:21.677 --> 02:05:22.700
Sit tight!

02:05:41.066 --> 02:05:42.550
For the queen.

02:06:56.566 --> 02:06:58.333
What's up with you, Riri?

02:06:58.833 --> 02:07:01.766
Mr. Griot,
I desperately need that support right now

02:07:01.849 --> 02:07:03.717
Finally, she asked

02:07:09.566 --> 02:07:10.566
Die.

02:07:15.332 --> 02:07:16.566
It's very fast.

02:07:17.066 --> 02:07:18.266
But I'm faster.

02:07:38.366 --> 02:07:39.319
I got you.

02:07:45.633 --> 02:07:46.883
It's up to you, Shuri

02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:57.500
Princess -
No.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.417
I am the Black Panther and I have come to seek revenge.

02:08:02.243 --> 02:08:05.100
The fumigation cells have been activated.

02:08:14.666 --> 02:08:15.566
What's wrong?

02:08:16.066 --> 02:08:17.550
Need a glass of water?

02:08:21.716 --> 02:08:22.549
We got it.

02:08:22.633 --> 02:08:24.350
Good!

02:08:24.766 --> 02:08:26.000
Back off!

02:08:30.733 --> 02:08:32.283
Let's go back to Wakanda.

02:08:38.133 --> 02:08:38.983
Back off!

02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:05.400
what is going on?

02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:07.917
The emitter of sonic waves has been destroyed.

02:09:29.766 --> 02:09:31.583
This does not bode well

02:10:03.433 --> 02:10:08.266
Hey, Panther, the Sea
Leaperd has lost power. They're taking a huge toll

02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:10.517
(Okoya).

02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:12.017
"Panther"

02:10:13.166 --> 02:10:14.217
(Anika)

02:10:15.617 --> 02:10:16.450
(Okoya).

02:10:16.533 --> 02:10:17.850
It is time.

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:29.750
For Wakanda!

02:10:30.490 --> 02:10:31.717
Wakanda!

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.750
Grieux, what's the harm?

02:10:41.833 --> 02:10:44.050
Disastrous. His spear is made of raw vibranium.

02:10:44.133 --> 02:10:46.717
The ship could explode at any moment. -
Take us to the desert.

02:11:05.566 --> 02:11:06.750
No!

02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:36.617
They sank the ship!

02:12:03.966 --> 02:12:05.340
I will take care of you, my sister.

02:12:05.423 --> 02:12:06.299
Hold on to me.

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:12.000
Warrior!

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:17.766
Do you speak the mother tongue?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.433
...you can use them to say hi to your ancestors.

02:13:50.433 --> 02:13:51.600
Get away from me!

02:14:03.433 --> 02:14:04.850
Well, come here

02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:11.650
You will pay homage to your ancestors

02:14:35.233 --> 02:14:37.250
May the ancestors save us

02:14:37.333 --> 02:14:38.950
...if the princess doesn't hurry up

02:14:39.033 --> 02:14:40.800
We may join them.

02:14:41.833 --> 02:14:45.117
In that case,
let us take as many of them as we can

02:15:15.133 --> 02:15:16.617
This situation was not necessary

02:15:21.273 --> 02:15:22.766
I need water.

02:15:39.566 --> 02:15:41.783
Will you be as noble as your brother?

02:15:41.866 --> 02:15:43.183
Or will you do what needs to be done

02:15:43.266 --> 02:15:44.283
Like me?

02:15:44.366 --> 02:15:46.033
I'm not like my brother.

02:15:47.672 --> 02:15:49.580
Naymore will beg for mercy.

02:15:50.233 --> 02:15:52.617
While I stand by and watch him die.

02:16:31.533 --> 02:16:33.966
"Imperious Rex!"

02:16:36.583 --> 02:16:37.733
Wakanda "Forever"

02:18:26.616 --> 02:18:27.799
(noise)

02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:30.333
Mom.

02:18:32.983 --> 02:18:36.516
Show him your true metal

02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:44.316
give up.

02:18:45.449 --> 02:18:47.966
Wakanda rules your oceans

02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:50.400
We will protect your secrets

02:18:50.483 --> 02:18:51.483
give up.

02:18:52.583 --> 02:18:54.349
Your people will survive

02:18:58.591 --> 02:19:00.833
We were obsessed with the desire for revenge

02:19:01.502 --> 02:19:03.900
We must not allow our people to be possessed

02:19:12.716 --> 02:19:14.433
give up.

02:19:39.449 --> 02:19:41.683
O Tolcanians!

02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:45.148
Let's go home

02:19:45.616 --> 02:19:47.116
Our fight ended here

02:20:00.049 --> 02:20:02.166
Wakanda "Forever"

02:20:02.249 --> 02:20:04.149
Wakanda "Forever"

02:20:27.449 --> 02:20:29.666
Song name: Coming Back For You
"Fireboy DML: singer name"

02:21:19.016 --> 02:21:20.266
Ready to go home?

02:21:20.349 --> 02:21:23.059
As long as I'm sure the police
won't be waiting for me at the airport

02:21:23.142 --> 02:21:24.666
do not worry. I dealt with that.

02:21:24.749 --> 02:21:28.471
But I advise you to limit your work
in completing assignments for students for a fee

02:21:28.554 --> 02:21:30.749
If they catch you, I can't help you with that

02:21:32.349 --> 02:21:34.233
They said you wanted to talk to me about something

02:21:34.316 --> 02:21:35.316
Yes.

02:21:35.849 --> 02:21:38.316
...about your suit. Its design is cool, though

02:21:39.383 --> 02:21:40.700
I can't let you take her with you

02:21:40.783 --> 02:21:41.616
There is nothing wrong.

02:21:42.116 --> 02:21:43.400
I thought it was the least I could do.

02:21:43.483 --> 02:21:45.649
He's helping Wakanda
deal with the chaos it's caused.

02:21:46.149 --> 02:21:47.833
I have one last thing I want to show you.

02:21:47.916 --> 02:21:49.233
Come.

02:21:53.248 --> 02:21:56.465
It took me time to find all the pieces in the river.

02:21:56.549 --> 02:21:58.049
But the result was worth it

02:21:58.583 --> 02:21:59.416
…How

02:22:01.016 --> 02:22:02.349
It's my dad's car.

02:22:03.796 --> 02:22:05.583
...we were working on it before that

02:22:11.516 --> 02:22:13.333
Are you sure this is it? -
Every piece of it -

02:22:13.416 --> 02:22:16.300
I'll have it shipped to Boston, and
it'll be there before you get there

02:22:21.949 --> 02:22:22.900
Hug me, my friend

02:22:26.535 --> 02:22:30.049
Panther, Miss Williams' transport has arrived.

02:22:31.483 --> 02:22:32.866
Take care of yourself.

02:22:33.449 --> 02:22:35.629
Are you sure you're not trying
to sneak into Chicago?

02:22:35.712 --> 02:22:37.449
Are you watching a Bulls game?

02:22:38.249 --> 02:22:41.816
This sounds fun,
but I have something I need to take care of

02:23:07.504 --> 02:23:09.966
And now I present to you

02:23:10.049 --> 02:23:11.233
Princess Shuri.

02:23:11.316 --> 02:23:12.916
"Black Panther"

02:23:31.049 --> 02:23:33.949
Black Panther sends her regards

02:23:34.783 --> 02:23:36.633
But she won't be joining us today.

02:23:37.849 --> 02:23:39.833
(I, Embaco

02:23:39.916 --> 02:23:44.449
Leader of the Jabari tribe and son of Wakanda

02:23:45.683 --> 02:23:49.766
I would like to participate in the challenge for the throne.

02:23:55.249 --> 02:23:56.983
What worries you, my daughter?

02:23:58.783 --> 02:24:06.283
…I've been looking forward to fighting alongside you all my life

02:24:06.749 --> 02:24:11.916
...when I think of you submitting to the Wakandans

02:24:12.216 --> 02:24:17.300
The Black Panther had many motives to kill me

02:24:17.883 --> 02:24:21.049
Why didn't you do that in your opinion?

02:24:22.816 --> 02:24:27.383
Black Panther is the strongest person

02:24:27.683 --> 02:24:33.483
In the strongest nation on the surface.

02:24:33.649 --> 02:24:36.716
But it has no allies

02:24:37.016 --> 02:24:41.683
And now she has sympathy for the Talocan people

02:24:43.449 --> 02:24:45.583
...with this alliance

02:24:46.216 --> 02:24:53.600
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

02:24:53.683 --> 02:24:57.683
...the surface world will attack Wakanda

02:24:58.416 --> 02:25:01.349
Wakanda will turn to us

02:25:02.949 --> 02:25:04.649
trust me.

02:25:21.283 --> 02:25:22.316
What the hell is this?

02:25:22.983 --> 02:25:24.083
Can we go back?

02:25:25.681 --> 02:25:27.688
I don't know, man. We'll waste an hour

02:25:28.916 --> 02:25:30.465
Can you go out and check it out?

02:25:30.548 --> 02:25:31.666
Good.

02:25:34.588 --> 02:25:35.740
Yeah, you're with Schover

02:25:36.516 --> 02:25:38.300
There seems to be a tree blocking our way

02:25:38.383 --> 02:25:40.100
How do you want us to act?

02:25:40.683 --> 02:25:41.516
...what a joke

02:25:43.383 --> 02:25:44.749
Die.

02:25:53.643 --> 02:25:55.609
A shackled colonizer

02:25:56.716 --> 02:25:58.700
Now I have seen all the wonders of the world.

02:25:58.783 --> 02:25:59.800
How light-hearted you are!

02:26:00.883 --> 02:26:01.600
Let's go.

02:26:28.783 --> 02:26:29.733
Thank you.

02:26:29.816 --> 02:26:30.466
You are welcome.

02:26:35.615 --> 02:26:36.448
Welcome.

02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:39.383
Hello!

02:26:41.289 --> 02:26:42.610
Nice to see you.

02:26:43.350 --> 02:26:46.160
Everything is ready. Just give me a moment.

02:26:46.243 --> 02:26:49.583
Actually, I think I should do this alone.

02:26:50.817 --> 02:26:52.100
You got it.

Can we join you now?

02:31:34.226 --> 02:31:37.092
This is my son, Toussaint

02:31:38.265 --> 02:31:39.258
Oh, Toussaint

02:31:40.075 --> 02:31:42.741
This is your Aunt Shuri

02:31:44.659 --> 02:31:45.492
Welcome.

02:32:06.574 --> 02:32:09.058
We agreed that it would be
better for him to grow up here.

02:32:09.141 --> 02:32:12.208
Far from the pressures of the throne.

02:32:14.042 --> 02:32:14.875
Your father.

02:32:15.624 --> 02:32:16.691
Your father.

02:32:17.491 --> 02:32:20.108
We prepared for his death, right?

02:32:24.858 --> 02:32:26.808
But he didn't want us to go to the funeral

02:32:27.691 --> 02:32:30.541
because he felt that the time was not right yet.

02:32:31.258 --> 02:32:34.191
We had our own ceremony for him here.

02:32:35.924 --> 02:32:37.525
Did my mom meet him?

02:32:37.608 --> 02:32:38.441
Yes.

02:32:47.991 --> 02:32:49.408
Glad to meet you.

02:32:49.491 --> 02:32:50.675
Glad to meet you.

02:32:50.758 --> 02:32:52.424
Toussaint is a beautiful name

02:32:53.091 --> 02:32:55.008
has a great history.

02:32:55.091 --> 02:32:58.341
Thanks. Your name is great too, I think.

02:33:01.924 --> 02:33:03.941
My mom says you are good at keeping secrets.

02:33:04.024 --> 02:33:04.874
is that true?

02:33:06.224 --> 02:33:08.908
Yes, I can keep on secrets.

02:33:12.062 --> 02:33:14.208
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

02:33:17.191 --> 02:33:18.458
who are you?

02:33:19.384 --> 02:33:23.591
My name is Prince T'Challa, son of King T'Challa.

Dedicated to our friend Chadwick Boseman.
