2
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:23.749
May all beings and all
be happy and free

3
00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.582
and may the thoughts, words and actions

4
00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.624
of my own life contribute in some way

5
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:30.874
to the happiness and freedom for all,

6
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:32.707
may health abound forever.

7
00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:37.416
May peace.

8
00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:43.832
- Verta.

9
00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:44.874
- Sister.

10
00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.249
- 1 had that vision again.

11
00:02:57.416 --> 00:03:00.791
I've meditated for 500 years.

12
00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:03.041
Immortality's nearly within reach.

13
00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:09.374
But I can never break through the wall.

14
00:03:23.957 --> 00:03:26.999
- 1 know, it's always treacherous.

15
00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.624
- There's an emptiness inside my heart.

16
00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:37.499
It's missing something.

17
00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:40.082
Why is it when I get
close, I always get thrown

18
00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.666
into all this chaos?

19
00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:44.791
Just what is it that I lack?

20
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.207
Hold this hairpin.

21
00:03:56.082 --> 00:03:58.666
- Hold it, you've always worn it.

22
00:03:58.832 --> 00:04:00.207
You've never let me...

23
00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.124
I'll allow it now.

24
00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:06.624
It was yours after all.

25
00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:09.791
Hold it tight.

26
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.541
Late in the
Tang Dynasty, chaos reigned,

27
00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.707
demons haunted the world.

28
00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:39.332
The emperor craved eternal life.

29
00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.707
His Dark General unable
to fulfill that desire,

30
00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:44.499
incurred his wrath.

31
00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:47.082
In order to regain the emperor's favor.

32
00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.291
The General had the people catch snakes

33
00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:51.541
to feed his Daoist powers.

34
00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:31.707
Force of
darkness, flow and gather.

35
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:36.124
Spread your power across the land.

36
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.874
Force of darkness, flow and gather.

37
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:48.541
Spread your power across the land.

38
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.582
Assassin!

39
00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.082
Seize her!

40
00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:03.332
On her, positions!

41
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:13.541
Where is she?

42
00:07:19.082 --> 00:07:21.374
There you are.
- Who are you?

43
00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.457
- It's a scary world, you're safe here.

44
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:28.916
Where are we?

45
00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:31.249
- Snake Catcher Village.

46
00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:33.999
What should I call you,
where are you from?

47
00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:50.874
What's wrong?

48
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:52.582
You don't remember anything?

49
00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:58.832
Oh, it's the snake catchers.

50
00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.916
It was our young Xuan who saved you.

51
00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:02.999
- So Xuan...

52
00:08:05.374 --> 00:08:08.957
- We catch snakes for a
living and we build our houses

53
00:08:09.124 --> 00:08:12.374
this way because the
mountains and forests are full

54
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:16.082
of wild beasts and demons as well.

55
00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:18.082
I'm a demon!

56
00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:21.916
- Careful where you run, kids.
- Auntie!

57
00:08:22.082 --> 00:08:22.749
- Hey, wait!
- The herbs Xuan

58
00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:24.041
picked out really worked!

59
00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:26.582
- I'm almost healed!
- Be careful!

60
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:29.374
Catching snakes is dangerous!
- She's a real beauty.

61
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.582
Hua, can you lower that wine down?

62
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:34.332
Sure, it's the good stuff too!

63
00:08:34.499 --> 00:08:35.166
Keeps snakes away!

64
00:08:35.332 --> 00:08:36.499
- Young lady, let's go.

65
00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:44.541
- Xuan, you're the last one again?

66
00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:46.207
You'll be sleeping with
the snakes tonight.

67
00:08:46.374 --> 00:08:47.749
You better hurry!

68
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.541
It's Xuan!

69
00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:25.916
- You're awake?

70
00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:31.874
Dudou?

71
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:33.791
How'd you get down there?

72
00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:36.374
- What, no snakes again, Xuan?

73
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.624
You want one of mine?

74
00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:41.082
A catcher afraid of snakes.

75
00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:43.124
If only your herbs could pay taxes.

76
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.082
Who needs taxes
when you can save lives?

77
00:09:46.249 --> 00:09:48.166
- Xuan is back!
- Yay, Xuan!

78
00:09:48.332 --> 00:09:48.999
What did you bring?

79
00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:50.416
- Come take a look.

80
00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:51.624
Who wants this one?

81
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:52.624
- I want it!
- Oh?

82
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.124
- Give it to me.
- Oh, easy now.

83
00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:03.957
Help.

84
00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:05.916
Help, they're going to eat us.

85
00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:11.207
- Young lady.

86
00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:16.541
Xuan, she doesn't
remember anything at all.

87
00:10:17.582 --> 00:10:19.499
- Hey, miss?

88
00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:22.541
Don't worry, I'll take
you to where I found you.

89
00:10:22.707 --> 00:10:23.666
There could be clues.

90
00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:31.291
Our snake traps are
usually set down there.

91
00:10:31.457 --> 00:10:33.041
- Why do you trap snakes?

92
00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:35.582
The world's
getting worse and worse

93
00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:37.666
and taxes just keep getting higher.

94
00:10:37.832 --> 00:10:39.832
The General lets us pay
them off with snakes.

95
00:10:40.832 --> 00:10:42.874
Which means no forced labor,

96
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:44.832
so we all decided to catch snakes.

97
00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:48.874
It's dangerous work,
but if you don't do it,

98
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:50.082
things would be worst.

99
00:10:51.957 --> 00:10:54.416
There, it was under that waterfall.

100
00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.832
Dudou, I know that's a shortcut

101
00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:01.332
but it's a rough path even for us

102
00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:02.624
and don't forget her.

103
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.499
Dudou!

104
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:16.374
Huh?

105
00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:19.832
You know magic?

106
00:11:29.832 --> 00:11:31.124
- Why don't I go first?

107
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.374
You can take your time.

108
00:11:37.457 --> 00:11:40.707
- Dudou, we ought to follow
her, wouldn't you say?

109
00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:41.624
Huh?

110
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:44.124
Dudou?

111
00:11:46.082 --> 00:11:47.457
Go on home then.

112
00:12:25.332 --> 00:12:28.166
I wish I knew magic.

113
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:30.791
What do you wanna bet you're
some kind of immortal?

114
00:12:30.957 --> 00:12:32.082
- I don't recall.

115
00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:34.374
What is this place?

116
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.499
- Oh, this is a shack I built.

117
00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:38.332
It's usually where I do this and that.

118
00:12:38.499 --> 00:12:39.832
Like dry herbs.

119
00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:43.207
When I'm a doctor, I won't
have to catch snakes.

120
00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:45.332
- "Hall of Defense?"

121
00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:47.249
Why is it that you call it that?

122
00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:49.249
- Huh, oh, this?

123
00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:50.999
It's something that I found by the river.

124
00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:53.582
Ah, right, so I was making umbrellas

125
00:12:53.749 --> 00:12:54.999
and then I heard Dudou.

126
00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:57.832
I went to look and you were
just there on that rock,

127
00:12:57.999 --> 00:12:59.832
floating halfway in the water.

128
00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:09.957
Kill the General,

129
00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:11.624
even if it costs your life.

130
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.291
Master, he's
our greatest enemy.

131
00:13:13.457 --> 00:13:14.249
You have our gratitude.

132
00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:15.124
I'm not ready.

133
00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:16.082
We have rules,

134
00:13:16.249 --> 00:13:18.166
you can't just act as you please.

135
00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:22.499
- Did you remember something?

136
00:13:25.624 --> 00:13:29.374
- Are there things you don't want to do

137
00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:31.207
yet you find you have to?

138
00:13:31.374 --> 00:13:34.166
- Sure, I don't wanna do lots of things,

139
00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:36.999
but that's what life is.

140
00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:40.082
Though naturally I'd rather
live it as freely as I can.

141
00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:43.457
That's why I study everything.

142
00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:47.082
Medicine, the stars, along
with the esoteric arts.

143
00:13:48.541 --> 00:13:52.332
Your fate may be set in
stone, how you live isn't.

144
00:13:57.666 --> 00:14:01.832
Spread
your power across the land.

145
00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:02.791
- You okay?

146
00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.832
I'm flying.

147
00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:17.249
Hey, I can fly.

148
00:14:19.582 --> 00:14:20.416
Wa-hoo!

149
00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:23.624
Hey, hey, look!

150
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.499
This is great, the wind's got us.

151
00:14:36.666 --> 00:14:38.499
Now we're really flying free!

152
00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:39.416
Wa-hoo!

153
00:15:37.957 --> 00:15:38.707
Xuan!

154
00:15:38.874 --> 00:15:40.999
- I'm fine, I grabbed this.

155
00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:42.416
What is this?

156
00:15:44.124 --> 00:15:46.166
- Just focus on climbing.
- Right.

157
00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.582
Miss, Miss!

158
00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:02.332
No!

159
00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:14.124
Wait, I know her.

160
00:16:17.124 --> 00:16:19.707
Isn't she the assassin
the General's after?

161
00:16:19.874 --> 00:16:23.749
- She is.
- The General, assassin?

162
00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.332
It could be a trap.

163
00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:30.916
Quick, before she wakes up.

164
00:16:32.832 --> 00:16:33.499
Who's there?

165
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:18.499
That hairpin
and I are connected.

166
00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:19.416
- You're awake.

167
00:17:24.207 --> 00:17:26.207
- 1 think this is magic.

168
00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:28.707
But ll don't know how to use it.

169
00:17:31.957 --> 00:17:33.707
"Precious Jade.”

170
00:17:33.874 --> 00:17:35.124
- Wait a second.

171
00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:38.457
Precious Jade.

172
00:17:42.832 --> 00:17:44.166
Precious Jade.

173
00:17:45.582 --> 00:17:46.999
Oh, that workshop.

174
00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.207
- What workshop?

175
00:17:48.374 --> 00:17:49.749
- I've heard that it's in an almond grove

176
00:17:49.916 --> 00:17:51.082
just outside of Yongzhou.

177
00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:54.041
And that they craft the finest wares out

178
00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:55.624
of that little workshop.

179
00:17:55.791 --> 00:17:58.291
This must be one of theirs,
let's go ask them about it.

180
00:17:59.749 --> 00:18:00.791
- Xuan, thank you.

181
00:18:02.124 --> 00:18:03.624
Don't trouble yourself though.

182
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.624
Who knows what kind of person I am.

183
00:18:07.707 --> 00:18:10.666
- Even if that isn't
clear yet, I know this,

184
00:18:10.832 --> 00:18:11.874
you're not evil.

185
00:18:16.249 --> 00:18:17.874
We're with the General!

186
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:18.791
Open up!

187
00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:22.749
Everyone come out now.

188
00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:24.457
- The General?

189
00:18:25.582 --> 00:18:27.707
Those two soldiers, we should go.

190
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:53.499
- Forgive us, this
year, shakes are scarce.

191
00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:56.666
We've done our best.

192
00:18:56.832 --> 00:19:00.041
- The world's in chaos
and demons are rising.

193
00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:02.666
The General is hard at
work honing his skills

194
00:19:02.832 --> 00:19:04.499
to save the country.

195
00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:07.707
- Right, demons feast on
flesh and show no mercy.

196
00:19:07.874 --> 00:19:09.874
We're truly grateful for the General.

197
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:14.957
- However, tonight, I'm here
regarding this umbrella.

198
00:19:15.874 --> 00:19:17.166
Whose is it?

199
00:19:17.332 --> 00:19:21.249
Also is there an unusual
woman dressed in white

200
00:19:21.416 --> 00:19:22.541
in this village?

201
00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:25.416
Answer him!

202
00:19:28.457 --> 00:19:29.832
- Please!
- Please don't hurt my baby!

203
00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:34.166
- Relax, just state the truth
and nothing shall happen.

204
00:19:35.332 --> 00:19:37.124
- Fine, I'll tell you.

205
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:38.624
I saw her with Xuan earlier.

206
00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:40.749
- My baby!

207
00:19:41.999 --> 00:19:44.249
- Search the village.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:45.124
- Come on.
- Over here.

209
00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:46.249
- I'll take this side.
- This way!

210
00:19:58.374 --> 00:20:00.791
- How much longer do we
have to stay in this cave

211
00:20:00.957 --> 00:20:01.957
and live in fear?

212
00:20:03.957 --> 00:20:05.957
It was a crucial task.

213
00:20:06.124 --> 00:20:08.374
Our master should've chosen me.

214
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.249
The scout's back!

215
00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:27.082
She really attacked you?

216
00:20:27.249 --> 00:20:29.416
- Yes, and she was serious enough

217
00:20:29.582 --> 00:20:30.999
that she nearly killed me!

218
00:20:31.166 --> 00:20:32.082
How dare she?

219
00:20:34.082 --> 00:20:36.541
- And for some reason, the General's army

220
00:20:36.707 --> 00:20:37.916
is racing this way.

221
00:20:42.832 --> 00:20:46.082
- Master, she's joined the
dark forces and betrayed us.

222
00:20:46.249 --> 00:20:49.416
- Also, I saw her with a snake catcher.

223
00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.999
It looked as if they
were fond of each other.

224
00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:52.916
- What?

225
00:20:56.874 --> 00:20:58.874
Really?

226
00:21:08.124 --> 00:21:09.624
Master.

227
00:21:12.207 --> 00:21:13.874
Don't
forget that the mantra

228
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:17.499
I've taught you all is the
very key to mutual strength.

229
00:21:18.582 --> 00:21:22.666
This hand flows to the source.

230
00:21:22.832 --> 00:21:25.582
United in good and bad.

231
00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:32.874
- My thanks, master, to you and everyone.

232
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.749
Il am restored.

233
00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:37.499
- Master, the White Snake
has betrayed us all.

234
00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:40.457
That's the--

235
00:21:40.624 --> 00:21:43.041
- Master, she would not betray us.

236
00:21:43.207 --> 00:21:44.041
I'll bring her back.

237
00:21:44.207 --> 00:21:47.624
- You, we all know how close you two are.

238
00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:50.291
- Master, use the Scorching Death Scales.

239
00:21:50.457 --> 00:21:51.791
Is she serious?

240
00:21:51.957 --> 00:21:55.249
Is she serious?

241
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:00.541
- Bring her and the
hairpin back in three days.

242
00:22:00.707 --> 00:22:03.791
Even I can't save you,
should the Scales activate.

243
00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:05.457
- Yes.

244
00:22:07.457 --> 00:22:09.082
Chang Pan.

245
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:15.916
- And these are the boy's belongings?

246
00:22:20.832 --> 00:22:23.624
Notify the General, he should head here.

247
00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:24.749
Yes, sir.

248
00:22:24.916 --> 00:22:27.791
- If I can extract that
young lady's energy,

249
00:22:27.957 --> 00:22:31.791
you snake catchers will
no longer have any use.

250
00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:57.374
- Yongzhou's not far.

251
00:23:01.374 --> 00:23:02.332
Still no memory?

252
00:23:05.457 --> 00:23:08.541
If I had that issue, I'd
have a huge headache.

253
00:23:08.707 --> 00:23:11.916
I just can't imagine not knowing yourself.

254
00:23:12.082 --> 00:23:13.957
Where you've been, what you've done.

255
00:23:16.499 --> 00:23:19.874
Then again, there's a lot

256
00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:21.749
that's better off forgotten.

257
00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:24.249
Look the wrong way and seasons turn,

258
00:23:24.416 --> 00:23:26.499
our lives are short but sorrows long.

259
00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:31.249
And so, we might as well
just focus on the good stuff.

260
00:23:46.332 --> 00:23:49.166
Hey captain, that song
of yours is ancient.

261
00:23:49.332 --> 00:23:50.499
What dynasty is that from?

262
00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:51.874
How about I sing one?

263
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:53.291
Sure, go ahead.

264
00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:02.457

D It's a dream J

280
00:25:06.582 --> 00:25:07.416
- Lovely.

281
00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:09.749
It's so true.

282
00:25:10.957 --> 00:25:13.041
It is like a dream.

283
00:25:13.207 --> 00:25:15.832
Enjoying life, it's nice.

284
00:25:15.999 --> 00:25:18.291
- If you like that song,
I'll teach it to you.

285
00:25:20.082 --> 00:25:21.124
- All right.

286
00:25:56.207 --> 00:25:58.041
Got it?

287
00:25:58.207 --> 00:25:59.832
Let's sing it together.

288
00:26:01.291 --> 00:26:04.582
We might as well, we've got the time.

289
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:19.457
- A mysterious girl, mysterious powers.

290
00:26:20.874 --> 00:26:23.166
She could be human or demon.

291
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:24.666
- You think you're a demon?

292
00:26:24.832 --> 00:26:26.582
They're all shapes and sizes, sure,

293
00:26:26.749 --> 00:26:28.916
but they're also known to eat people.

294
00:26:29.082 --> 00:26:30.082
How could you be one?

295
00:26:31.707 --> 00:26:33.499
And who cares if you are?

296
00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:35.166
For instance, Dudou.

297
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:40.207
If he was one, I'd still like the fella

298
00:26:40.374 --> 00:26:42.666
and ll know the reverse
is true, right, boy?

299
00:26:43.957 --> 00:26:44.791
- Really?

300
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:47.707
- Who says I like you?
- What?

301
00:26:47.874 --> 00:26:50.166
- You're just the one who feeds me.

302
00:26:50.332 --> 00:26:52.332
Am I talking now?

303
00:26:52.499 --> 00:26:53.249
Woof, woof?

304
00:26:56.541 --> 00:26:58.207
Why am I talking, why am I talking?

305
00:26:58.374 --> 00:26:59.124
I shouldn't be?

306
00:27:01.457 --> 00:27:03.624
Will people think I'm a
demon now and kill me?

307
00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:04.457
Why does my voice sound like this?

308
00:27:04.624 --> 00:27:06.291
- Sh, sh, not so loud.

309
00:27:06.457 --> 00:27:07.166
He'll hear you.
- I can talk.

310
00:27:09.749 --> 00:27:12.832
Be careful,
the river runs fast here!

311
00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:14.249
You'll fall in!

312
00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:50.624
- You really are with a human.

313
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:53.041
Your life is mine!

314
00:28:00.707 --> 00:28:01.457
- No!

315
00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:15.874
Watch out!

316
00:28:42.582 --> 00:28:43.416
Hey.

317
00:29:07.541 --> 00:29:09.957
- Xuan, Xuan, why don't we just go?

318
00:29:12.207 --> 00:29:13.457
I'm talking to you.

319
00:29:20.749 --> 00:29:22.457
I really think we should go.

320
00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:24.249
Xuan!

321
00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:31.999
Stop that!

322
00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:33.791
Aren't you scared of snakes?

323
00:29:33.957 --> 00:29:35.624
That's a snake demon, Xuan!

324
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:37.124
- Quiet!

325
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:39.082
I can't just leave her all alone here.

326
00:29:40.541 --> 00:29:42.124
- Do what you like.

327
00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:01.666
- Dudou, why was he holding me?

328
00:31:01.832 --> 00:31:04.416
- You were shivering, cold as ice.

329
00:31:04.582 --> 00:31:07.999
Xuan kept you warm, that's
why he was holding you.

330
00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:10.291
That brought you around, you were so cold,

331
00:31:10.457 --> 00:31:11.957
you iced up the floor.

332
00:31:12.124 --> 00:31:14.041
But we didn't leave you.

333
00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:34.582
- There you are.

334
00:31:35.749 --> 00:31:36.999
I was afraid you'd left.

335
00:31:55.749 --> 00:31:56.582
- A demon's tail.

336
00:31:58.457 --> 00:31:59.874
I guess I am one.

337
00:32:02.207 --> 00:32:03.374
- Does it matter?

338
00:32:04.582 --> 00:32:07.457
The world's full of awful
folks without tails.

339
00:32:07.624 --> 00:32:08.957
Who cares if you've got one.

340
00:32:22.666 --> 00:32:24.166
- You weren't awful.

341
00:32:46.291 --> 00:32:48.166
Well, what
do ya think, huh, huh?

342
00:32:48.332 --> 00:32:48.999
No thanks.

343
00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:52.207
- Good sir, we barely made it
to the city with our lives.

344
00:32:53.124 --> 00:32:54.041
Do you have any food?

345
00:32:54.207 --> 00:32:56.207
- There's so many vagrants around lately.

346
00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:58.041
Let's go, dear.

347
00:32:58.207 --> 00:33:00.999
Out of the way!

348
00:33:01.166 --> 00:33:02.082
- You're all right.
- Is she okay?

349
00:33:02.249 --> 00:33:04.832
Don't cry.

350
00:33:07.541 --> 00:33:10.541
- Those poor refugees, it's so sad.

351
00:33:10.707 --> 00:33:12.041
They're considered lucky.

352
00:33:12.207 --> 00:33:14.499
Yongzhou is still relatively safe.

353
00:33:19.332 --> 00:33:20.166
Huh?

354
00:33:21.624 --> 00:33:22.374
- What's wrong?

355
00:33:22.541 --> 00:33:23.624
- Oh, it's nothing.

356
00:33:29.457 --> 00:33:30.416
Let's go.

357
00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:37.166
- Huh?

358
00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:41.166
You're not alone, you know.

359
00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:42.666
PRECIOUS JADE WORKSHOP

360
00:33:50.166 --> 00:33:51.541
Faster!

361
00:33:51.707 --> 00:33:54.999
- I think ll was here once.
- Position 31.

362
00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:55.916
Stop!

363
00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:04.124
Ah, we have guests, I see.

364
00:34:06.166 --> 00:34:09.832
Oh, you've returned, young lady.

365
00:34:09.999 --> 00:34:11.291
Issues with the wand?

366
00:34:12.957 --> 00:34:15.791
- Oh, right, we would like to
know more about its origin.

367
00:34:22.582 --> 00:34:25.916
Hm, do tell.

368
00:34:32.207 --> 00:34:37.082
Though you're human, I detect
the distinct scent of a demon.

369
00:34:37.249 --> 00:34:42.249
Perchance you were
cozy with a certain one?

370
00:34:48.249 --> 00:34:50.166
Well, regardless, come.

371
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:20.124
Every demon within 300 Ii flocks here.

372
00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:23.041
If you require artifacts
of the magical sort,

373
00:35:23.207 --> 00:35:25.332
come to Precious Jade Workshop,

374
00:35:25.499 --> 00:35:28.249
where all our weapons
are of demon quality.

375
00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:47.832
- Whoa.

376
00:36:01.749 --> 00:36:02.582
- Get to work!

377
00:36:18.082 --> 00:36:20.166
This hairpin belonged to another owner

378
00:36:20.332 --> 00:36:22.624
if I recall correctly.

379
00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:26.624
It saps the energy of others
and converts it to its owner's

380
00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:28.166
for future use.

381
00:36:28.332 --> 00:36:31.207
- Saps energy?
- Indeed.

382
00:36:31.374 --> 00:36:33.791
This wand has no equal.

383
00:36:45.707 --> 00:36:49.916
When young lady was here,
you asked for an alteration,

384
00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:51.541
so you could control it.

385
00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:54.249
Good.

386
00:36:55.124 --> 00:36:58.416
Good.

387
00:36:58.582 --> 00:37:00.082
No good!

388
00:37:00.249 --> 00:37:03.832
But such changes could
create large side effects.

389
00:37:03.999 --> 00:37:06.499
- I'll say, she can't recall a thing.

390
00:37:06.666 --> 00:37:07.499
That's the reason why?

391
00:37:07.666 --> 00:37:10.416
- Oh, I think you're right.

392
00:37:10.582 --> 00:37:13.624
One's foes do get drained, but then...

393
00:37:16.707 --> 00:37:20.416
It could in all likelihood
erase one's memories

394
00:37:20.582 --> 00:37:24.999
and without those, what
use are magic powers?

395
00:37:25.166 --> 00:37:30.082
Heaven knows, for every
gain, there's a loss.

396
00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:32.124
Poetic, no?

397
00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:32.957
- Yet you--

398
00:37:33.124 --> 00:37:35.082
- But young lady was insistent,

399
00:37:35.249 --> 00:37:38.291
you can blame it on this fox's vanity.

400
00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:40.207
These sorts of reversals,

401
00:37:40.374 --> 00:37:42.416
changing heaven into earth,

402
00:37:42.582 --> 00:37:45.874
evil to good, people to demons,

403
00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:49.166
manipulating that, holds interest to us.

404
00:37:52.249 --> 00:37:54.541
- So this hairpin then.

405
00:37:54.707 --> 00:37:56.624
Do you know where its old owner is?

406
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:59.957
Of course.

407
00:38:26.082 --> 00:38:28.832
That's pretty big, isn't it?

408
00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:33.791
- It's from one of my kind,
though they're clearly stronger.

409
00:38:33.957 --> 00:38:35.582
I can tell it's a snake scale.

410
00:38:35.749 --> 00:38:36.541
- A snake's?

411
00:39:13.082 --> 00:39:15.166
- You're a snake catcher!

412
00:39:18.457 --> 00:39:19.749
Blanca!

413
00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:21.541
- Blanca!
- Blanca!

414
00:39:21.707 --> 00:39:23.082
- Blanca!
- Blanca!

415
00:39:23.249 --> 00:39:24.707
- Blanca!
- Blanca!

416
00:39:24.874 --> 00:39:25.624
- Verta.

417
00:39:27.874 --> 00:39:28.707
- Blanca?

418
00:39:34.624 --> 00:39:35.457
- Verta!

419
00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.457
You're Verta!

420
00:39:39.582 --> 00:39:40.457
I know who I was.

421
00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:48.666
- You were given that
hairpin and an order.

422
00:39:48.832 --> 00:39:50.166
To kill the General.

423
00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:54.957
You don't recall, sister?

424
00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:00.832
- Why does he need snakes?

425
00:40:01.916 --> 00:40:04.166
- That swine is using dark kung-fu.

426
00:40:04.332 --> 00:40:06.166
The same that we snakes employ.

427
00:40:06.332 --> 00:40:09.374
He increases his power through
feeding on our essence.

428
00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:13.666
Master hates the General and his kind.

429
00:40:13.832 --> 00:40:18.707
She says they're sinister
and vicious to the last.

430
00:40:18.874 --> 00:40:19.707
- He's different.

431
00:40:20.874 --> 00:40:23.374
When I was lost, with no memory,

432
00:40:25.332 --> 00:40:26.707
he saved me.

433
00:40:26.874 --> 00:40:29.207
- Even so, I don't trust him.

434
00:40:29.374 --> 00:40:32.124
- So that's what the General's
been up to with the snakes.

435
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:35.457
- Deceiver! And you catch snakes, killer!

436
00:40:35.624 --> 00:40:36.624
- 1 really had no idea.

437
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:40.707
Death to collaborators!

438
00:40:40.874 --> 00:40:42.166
What's your plan now?

439
00:40:42.332 --> 00:40:44.249
- Verta, release Xuan.

440
00:40:46.207 --> 00:40:47.707
Xuan!

441
00:40:53.332 --> 00:40:56.416
- A snake catcher like you, so
unwilling to leave her side.

442
00:40:56.582 --> 00:40:57.249
You're hiding something.

443
00:40:57.416 --> 00:40:58.916
- Verta.
- You're a snake?

444
00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:01.666
So hot blooded, not good for your health.

445
00:41:01.832 --> 00:41:04.374
You!!

446
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:06.249
Talk, what are you after?

447
00:41:19.707 --> 00:41:22.041
Huh, so you are with the dark forces.

448
00:41:22.207 --> 00:41:24.666
- 1 have no idea what
that is or what's going on

449
00:41:24.832 --> 00:41:25.499
with this thing.

450
00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:27.582
- See, sister, he is with the General.

451
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:33.041
Ll trust Xuan.

452
00:41:33.207 --> 00:41:34.499
Trust, huh?

453
00:41:39.082 --> 00:41:40.082
1 refuse to.

454
00:41:41.082 --> 00:41:42.416
The snake catcher is mine!

455
00:41:50.332 --> 00:41:52.332
Get up!

456
00:41:52.499 --> 00:41:55.291
- Sister, you've forgotten
our clan's teachings!

457
00:41:55.457 --> 00:41:58.541
All humans are devious,
they are cheats and thieves!

458
00:42:00.416 --> 00:42:02.582
- Verta, I don't remember a lot,

459
00:42:02.749 --> 00:42:04.791
only our journey here and
he's not those things.

460
00:42:04.957 --> 00:42:06.499
<i>- I do remember!</i>

461
00:42:07.749 --> 00:42:08.582
- Follow me!

462
00:42:13.666 --> 00:42:14.916
Careful.

463
00:42:15.082 --> 00:42:15.957
Could be dangerous.

464
00:42:30.624 --> 00:42:35.624
Oh, who'd have guessed that
this pagoda had a hidden tunnel.

465
00:42:40.874 --> 00:42:42.124
We should find a way out.

466
00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:07.249
Blanca!

467
00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:22.582
- Blanca!

468
00:43:39.041 --> 00:43:40.874
Bird on a ceiling, tortoise under,

469
00:43:41.041 --> 00:43:43.416
palace within, gate without, eight doors,

470
00:43:43.582 --> 00:43:45.249
the door of life, that's it!

471
00:44:05.582 --> 00:44:09.541
Don't worry, you went
through the door of life.

472
00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:22.291
- What is this place?

473
00:44:23.624 --> 00:44:26.707
- It looks like an
underground exorcism chamber.

474
00:44:26.874 --> 00:44:29.416
So it should be safe for humans.

475
00:44:29.582 --> 00:44:33.957
Still, why is there a
Daoist chamber down here?

476
00:44:34.124 --> 00:44:35.916
I guess there was an abandoned temple

477
00:44:36.082 --> 00:44:37.957
and they built the pagoda on top of it.

478
00:44:42.249 --> 00:44:45.541
Relax, there should be clues
around here, I'll go look.

479
00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:49.624
We will get out, wait here, okay, hm?

480
00:45:05.707 --> 00:45:09.207
- Heaven and earth, breath of all life.

481
00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:12.291
Ceaseless honing, magic abounds.

482
00:45:12.457 --> 00:45:15.749
Demons wither, monsters shrivel.

483
00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:18.874
Evil expires, drowned by heaven.

484
00:45:28.916 --> 00:45:32.291
Spread
your power across the land.

485
00:45:32.457 --> 00:45:35.707
This is
a magic weapon, take it

486
00:45:35.874 --> 00:45:38.124
and assassinate the General.

487
00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:42.624
- Miss?

488
00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:51.207
I remember it all.

489
00:45:54.582 --> 00:45:56.291
- 1 found the exit, let's go.

490
00:45:57.249 --> 00:45:58.166
- Hey Xuan.

491
00:45:59.541 --> 00:46:02.707
Would you say demons are fated to die?

492
00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:06.874
- Blanca, you're...

493
00:46:16.624 --> 00:46:19.374
Forcing us to catch
snakes for the slaughter.

494
00:46:19.541 --> 00:46:21.541
The world is in chaos!

495
00:46:21.707 --> 00:46:25.166
And if this goes on,
things will get even worse.

496
00:46:27.207 --> 00:46:29.832
Blanca, whatever happens,

497
00:46:30.874 --> 00:46:31.999
I'll be there.

498
00:48:10.207 --> 00:48:10.957
Dudou!

499
00:48:12.249 --> 00:48:13.082
You.

500
00:48:18.957 --> 00:48:20.541
- Sister?

501
00:48:20.707 --> 00:48:23.291
- Verta, I'll go with you.

502
00:48:23.457 --> 00:48:25.332
- Sister, you've seen the light?

503
00:48:25.499 --> 00:48:26.499
- Where are you going?

504
00:48:27.499 --> 00:48:30.707
- Sorry, we need to part ways.

505
00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:32.291
- Why should we?

506
00:48:32.457 --> 00:48:33.791
- The world's heartless.

507
00:48:36.707 --> 00:48:40.666
There are rules here and so many things

508
00:48:40.832 --> 00:48:42.124
that I'm forced to do.

509
00:48:43.707 --> 00:48:46.499
You're human, I'm demon.

510
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:52.791
You said once, there are things
that are better forgotten.

511
00:49:02.707 --> 00:49:05.166
- It's like you say,
the world's heartless,

512
00:49:05.332 --> 00:49:07.041
our paths different.

513
00:49:07.207 --> 00:49:08.749
What we have is real though.

514
00:49:11.832 --> 00:49:13.416
I'll find a way for us.

515
00:49:19.374 --> 00:49:21.707
It won't take long.

516
00:49:21.874 --> 00:49:22.624
Wait for me.

517
00:49:24.749 --> 00:49:26.957
Dudou.

518
00:49:44.374 --> 00:49:47.207
- You're human, if we're together,

519
00:49:48.207 --> 00:49:49.874
it'll just hurt you.

520
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:58.291
- Sister, I doubt he'll
return, we should go back.

521
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:04.041
Sister.

522
00:50:05.832 --> 00:50:08.832
We've been together for
hundreds of years now.

523
00:50:10.416 --> 00:50:13.666
- Things are different though, for him.

524
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:27.624
- We worked so diligently
and endured such hardship.

525
00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:30.624
Forms such as these aren't easy to attain

526
00:50:30.791 --> 00:50:32.791
nor these lovely faces.

527
00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:37.457
But our true nature will reveal itself.

528
00:50:40.374 --> 00:50:43.707
When it does, will he
still find you charming?

529
00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:51.416
Master once said, only
humans know the taste

530
00:50:51.582 --> 00:50:53.749
of love and desire.

531
00:50:53.916 --> 00:50:56.541
- When I first awoke, I thought I was one.

532
00:51:00.207 --> 00:51:03.624
- 1 think the taste of love
and desire is overrated.

533
00:51:03.791 --> 00:51:07.624
Laying like this, it's like
the statue's embracing me.

534
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.291
Isn't this good enough?

535
00:51:11.249 --> 00:51:12.332
- It's cold though.

536
00:51:19.499 --> 00:51:20.707
Am I cold too?

537
00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:23.332
- What's that on you?
- Don't.

538
00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:26.666
It's the Scorching Death Scales.

539
00:51:27.666 --> 00:51:30.874
I promised the master I'd
get you back in three days.

540
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:31.999
If not--

541
00:51:32.166 --> 00:51:35.249
- The Death Scales will tear you in two.

542
00:51:35.416 --> 00:51:37.707
Why did you?

543
00:51:37.874 --> 00:51:39.082
- Hurry, surround them!
- Sister.

544
00:51:40.374 --> 00:51:45.166
Yes, young one, I can help you.

545
00:51:45.332 --> 00:51:46.082
- You can?

546
00:51:46.957 --> 00:51:51.374
You know, I was young once too.

547
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.291
Rather frivolous as well as wild.

548
00:51:54.457 --> 00:51:57.582
Even now, I have quite a few regrets.

549
00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:03.457
You should know one day,

550
00:52:03.624 --> 00:52:04.707
you could regret this.

551
00:52:04.874 --> 00:52:06.332
- I'll regret things right now

552
00:52:06.499 --> 00:52:07.457
as long as we're not together.

553
00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:11.832
So be it, you
are young, aren't you?

554
00:52:11.999 --> 00:52:15.666
Though transactions require an exchange.

555
00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:19.124
Can you afford what it will cost?

556
00:52:19.291 --> 00:52:21.207
- I'll trade you anything.

557
00:52:21.374 --> 00:52:24.166
- Good, there is one way.

558
00:52:25.541 --> 00:52:26.791
Become a demon.

559
00:52:26.957 --> 00:52:28.124
- What?

560
00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:28.957
What do you...

561
00:52:29.124 --> 00:52:31.457
- Young one, think.

562
00:52:31.624 --> 00:52:35.332
If you're a demon, then
you two can stay together.

563
00:52:36.624 --> 00:52:40.957
However, I would need to
take your vital essence.

564
00:52:44.249 --> 00:52:47.457
Demons such as ourselves
require human vitality

565
00:52:47.624 --> 00:52:49.082
to create our magic weapons.

566
00:52:50.249 --> 00:52:52.916
The most effective
demonic weapons are forged

567
00:52:53.082 --> 00:52:54.832
from this very vitality.

568
00:52:55.957 --> 00:52:58.832
Precious Jade Workshop
is renowned for staying

569
00:52:58.999 --> 00:53:01.082
on the leading edge of that front.

570
00:53:02.124 --> 00:53:05.541
- If I have to, it's a deal.

571
00:53:05.707 --> 00:53:07.916
Good.

572
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:15.249
However, do you understand
the consequences of this?

573
00:53:15.416 --> 00:53:19.457
As a human, you're currently
afforded several advantages.

574
00:53:19.624 --> 00:53:21.541
Such as peace and safety.

575
00:53:21.707 --> 00:53:25.082
You muddle through life
taking it for granted

576
00:53:25.249 --> 00:53:29.249
but as one of us, gods, humans and Daoists

577
00:53:29.416 --> 00:53:30.832
will all want to kill you.

578
00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:33.624
Even your own kind will want to kill you.

579
00:53:35.082 --> 00:53:37.791
Once I finish taking your vital essence,

580
00:53:37.957 --> 00:53:41.916
you'll be turned into the
weakest and smallest of demons.

581
00:53:42.082 --> 00:53:45.874
However hard you try,
there will be no advancing.

582
00:53:46.041 --> 00:53:48.166
- 1 understand, do it.

583
00:53:49.207 --> 00:53:50.874
- Sure, let's start.

584
00:54:19.582 --> 00:54:22.416
I merely forgot, for this to work,

585
00:54:23.249 --> 00:54:25.624
1 still require one ingredient.

586
00:54:27.416 --> 00:54:28.916
- What ingredient?

587
00:54:30.499 --> 00:54:32.624
You can't do this!

588
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:34.082
Let go of him!

589
00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.416
- Hello, we meet again.

590
00:54:49.624 --> 00:54:52.499
That hairpin isn't so fearsome.

591
00:54:52.666 --> 00:54:56.332
You tried to kill my master
with such meager power?

592
00:54:59.582 --> 00:55:02.832
One of your kind is
quite the valuable thing

593
00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:04.582
to Daoists like us.

594
00:55:04.749 --> 00:55:07.124
You're worth 10,000 snakes.

595
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:08.374
- Why you!

596
00:55:08.541 --> 00:55:10.999
- Which is why ll informed
my master you were

597
00:55:11.166 --> 00:55:13.082
at Snake Catcher Village.

598
00:55:13.249 --> 00:55:16.207
Looking at the hour, he
could arrive there soon.

599
00:55:17.457 --> 00:55:20.332
Leaving you two all to me.

600
00:55:20.499 --> 00:55:23.416
There's no reason to share the credit.

601
00:55:23.582 --> 00:55:26.166
- Little Daoist, you really are awful,

602
00:55:26.332 --> 00:55:27.999
but thanks for the information.

603
00:55:28.166 --> 00:55:29.416
Once we're finished with you,

604
00:55:29.582 --> 00:55:31.582
your master will shortly follow.

605
00:56:12.832 --> 00:56:16.582
So the little
Daoist is actually this ugly?

606
00:56:16.749 --> 00:56:18.832
No wonder you wrecked the place.

607
00:56:18.999 --> 00:56:21.207
With all these handsome statues around,

608
00:56:21.374 --> 00:56:23.791
you were jealous.

609
00:57:37.082 --> 00:57:39.916
- Escaping this net is
quite futile, I assure you.

610
00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:52.166
No!

611
00:58:06.999 --> 00:58:07.999
- Xuan, Xuan!

612
00:58:09.666 --> 00:58:10.874
You're awake?

613
00:58:11.041 --> 00:58:12.499
Xuan, Xuan!

614
00:58:16.124 --> 00:58:16.874
Xuan!

615
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:23.707
You still have it.

616
00:58:27.624 --> 00:58:28.707
How are you?

617
00:58:28.874 --> 00:58:31.457
Huh?

618
00:58:38.666 --> 00:58:40.374
Dudou!
- You have a tail now.

619
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:42.624
Look!

620
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:43.624
I'm a demon.

621
00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:44.791
- With a tail and everything.

622
00:58:44.957 --> 00:58:46.582
- Dudou, where's your tail?

623
00:58:46.749 --> 00:58:48.082
It's right--

624
00:58:48.249 --> 00:58:49.749
Where is it?

625
00:58:49.916 --> 00:58:51.749
- This was Dudou's.
- It's gone!

626
00:58:52.832 --> 00:58:55.874
- Dudou, easy, looks like
we're both freaks now.

627
00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:58.499
We'll make the best of it
moving forward, together.

628
00:59:02.624 --> 00:59:03.791
Let's go.

629
00:59:07.624 --> 00:59:10.124
Dudou, I can run so fast now!

630
00:59:10.291 --> 00:59:12.124
- Too fast, I can't catch up.

631
00:59:30.874 --> 00:59:32.624
Ah, gees!

632
00:59:32.791 --> 00:59:35.249
- I'm back, Blanca, and I'm like you now.

633
00:59:37.166 --> 00:59:39.624
- Didn't they take your vitality?

634
00:59:39.791 --> 00:59:44.707
You're so fast!

635
00:59:54.166 --> 00:59:56.249
- Blanca, Blanca!

636
00:59:57.332 --> 00:59:58.166
Where are you?

637
01:00:00.749 --> 01:00:01.582
Blanca!

638
01:00:02.624 --> 01:00:03.457
- Xuan, Xuan!

639
01:00:18.416 --> 01:00:20.791
- Don't take my powers, don't do it.

640
01:00:21.957 --> 01:00:23.332
I beg you.

641
01:00:23.499 --> 01:00:25.374
Xuan, look at this!

642
01:00:38.874 --> 01:00:40.041
Demons are coming!

643
01:00:40.207 --> 01:00:41.582
Run for your lives!

644
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:53.457
Demons are coming!

645
01:00:58.957 --> 01:01:00.291
- Blanca, Blanca!

646
01:02:05.957 --> 01:02:06.791
Blanca?

647
01:02:12.791 --> 01:02:14.124
Hurry.

648
01:02:47.582 --> 01:02:48.832
- Wait, Blanca!

649
01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:51.082
Blanca!

650
01:02:54.749 --> 01:02:57.166
It's huge, is that Blanca?

651
01:02:57.332 --> 01:02:59.457
Let's just go, maybe
they can turn us back.

652
01:02:59.624 --> 01:03:02.582
You really did return.

653
01:03:02.749 --> 01:03:05.832
Though Blanca herself has now
turned into a giant python.

654
01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:11.374
That Daoist stole her weapon,

655
01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:14.916
but somehow she drained
his strength instead.

656
01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:16.291
How could that be?

657
01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:21.749
- Interesting, you're one of us now.

658
01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:26.291
Little one, you scarcely know her.

659
01:03:26.457 --> 01:03:28.332
What kind of connection could you share?

660
01:03:28.499 --> 01:03:33.207
In the end, you just fell
for my sister's pretty face.

661
01:03:33.374 --> 01:03:37.749
Now that she has
changed into her full demon form,

662
01:03:37.916 --> 01:03:39.291
are you still fond of her?

663
01:03:40.666 --> 01:03:42.249
- Where is she going?

664
01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:45.582
- Snake Catcher Village, little one,

665
01:03:45.749 --> 01:03:47.291
you're still in the dark?

666
01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:48.999
The General's there now.

667
01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:51.374
She's looking to settle the score.

668
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:52.582
- He's there?

669
01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:55.374
- And before too long, that village

670
01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.457
will be drowned in tragedy.

671
01:03:57.624 --> 01:03:58.749
- Our village?

672
01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:00.541
Pick a side.

673
01:04:05.124 --> 01:04:06.499
- Xuan, where do we go now?

674
01:04:09.457 --> 01:04:10.416
- We're going home.

675
01:04:25.332 --> 01:04:27.374
- The General's at Snake Catcher Village?

676
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:30.249
- 1 saw his fleet, it's gigantic.

677
01:04:30.416 --> 01:04:31.832
- My guess is that he already knows

678
01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:35.249
where we're hiding and he's coming for us.

679
01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:36.832
- How can he know where we are?

680
01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:37.666
Unless there's a--

681
01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:40.207
- Chang Pan is loyal to
us and the Green Snake

682
01:04:40.374 --> 01:04:43.291
has the Death Scales, neither
one can be the betrayer.

683
01:04:43.457 --> 01:04:44.791
- Maybe it was the White Snake,

684
01:04:44.957 --> 01:04:47.249
she could've joined the General's side.

685
01:04:51.249 --> 01:04:53.416
- There's clearly a traitor among you!

686
01:04:53.582 --> 01:04:56.041
But we won't wait for them to attack us.

687
01:04:56.207 --> 01:04:58.457
Though we're outnumbered,
we'll take our chances

688
01:04:58.624 --> 01:04:59.999
on the front lines.

689
01:05:00.999 --> 01:05:03.416
All of us will attack
Snake Catcher Village!

690
01:05:03.582 --> 01:05:05.916
Find the traitor, kill the Daoists!

691
01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:07.332
Crush the village!

692
01:05:07.499 --> 01:05:09.207
Find the
traitor, kill the Daoists,

693
01:05:09.374 --> 01:05:11.166
crush the village, find the traitor,

694
01:05:11.332 --> 01:05:14.582
kill the Daoists, crush the village!

695
01:05:14.749 --> 01:05:17.374
Have a load and back here.

696
01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:20.082
- Everyone run, the village is in danger!

697
01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.416
A giant python is on its way here!

698
01:05:22.582 --> 01:05:23.999
Hurry, stop what you're doing and run!

699
01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:25.249
- What's gotten into you?

700
01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:26.957
Walls are high here,
what are you scared of?

701
01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.124
- So are Yongzhou's and it was destroyed.

702
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.041
We have to run, there's no time.

703
01:05:31.207 --> 01:05:33.791
- Yongzhou's solid stone,
pythons, there's no way.

704
01:05:33.957 --> 01:05:35.291
Xuan, you finally returned.

705
01:05:35.457 --> 01:05:37.249
- Auntie, you should leave now.

706
01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:39.457
- 1 should, let me tidy up first.

707
01:05:39.624 --> 01:05:40.499
Just go!

708
01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.291
The General has arrived.

709
01:06:12.374 --> 01:06:13.874
- A giant python.

710
01:06:24.124 --> 01:06:27.124
The truth is that you're a demon.

711
01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:30.791
So how do we know this
isn't some demon trick?

712
01:06:30.957 --> 01:06:33.166
- General, you should defend the peace,

713
01:06:33.332 --> 01:06:35.207
not invite disaster.

714
01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:41.041
- He is a demon.
- Yeah, but who really cares?

715
01:06:41.207 --> 01:06:45.082
I'm still Xuan and I still
ran here to warn all of you.

716
01:06:45.249 --> 01:06:47.457
Yongzhou's in ruins
and this place is next.

717
01:06:47.624 --> 01:06:49.249
Listen, you have to run!

718
01:06:50.457 --> 01:06:53.916
- You're evil!

719
01:06:54.082 --> 01:06:56.249
Useless little thing.

720
01:06:57.082 --> 01:06:59.666
- It's all your fault,
you risked our lives,

721
01:06:59.832 --> 01:07:01.749
made us catch snakes to feed your power

722
01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:04.166
and forced Blanca to turn into a python!

723
01:07:10.499 --> 01:07:13.749
She's here, let me go, I could save us!

724
01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:15.332
- Why not?

725
01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:16.541
Go ahead.

726
01:07:36.374 --> 01:07:37.207
- Blanca!

727
01:07:42.707 --> 01:07:45.832
Blanca, in Yongzhou, you
had to face those soldiers.

728
01:07:45.999 --> 01:07:47.666
You didn't want to hurt them,

729
01:07:47.832 --> 01:07:50.041
but up ahead, while they may catch snakes,

730
01:07:50.207 --> 01:07:51.624
they really are all innocent,

731
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:54.957
so please don't turn the
village into a second Yongzhou!

732
01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:48.957
Blanca!

733
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:04.666
Blanca, just listen.

734
01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:07.999
I've been turned into one of you.

735
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:11.166
Now we're both demons.

736
01:09:14.374 --> 01:09:17.499
Even though you've
grown, it doesn't matter.

737
01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:19.374
There's a vast world out there,

738
01:09:19.541 --> 01:09:21.332
full of all kinds of wonders.

739
01:09:21.499 --> 01:09:23.166
So who cares what your body's like.

740
01:09:23.999 --> 01:09:27.624
Blanca, even though I'm
the weakest of your kind,

741
01:09:27.791 --> 01:09:29.416
I'll give my all to protect you.

742
01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.166
And if they won't accept us,

743
01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:34.832
we'll just go to the ends of the Earth.

744
01:09:34.999 --> 01:09:38.499
Our place is out there,
we just have to find it.

745
01:09:38.666 --> 01:09:42.291
A pair of demons, together and free.

746
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:47.707
Blanca.

747
01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:01.957
Blanca!

748
01:10:04.082 --> 01:10:04.916
- Sister!

749
01:10:23.207 --> 01:10:26.791
- Surprising, there
was a python after all.

750
01:10:29.957 --> 01:10:31.999
You're to thank for this, little demon.

751
01:10:32.166 --> 01:10:32.832
- You!

752
01:10:32.999 --> 01:10:35.791
- Without you, I could not
have readied this trap.

753
01:10:43.457 --> 01:10:47.332
You shall now be
extinguished, body and soul.

754
01:11:00.499 --> 01:11:01.416
- What?

755
01:11:01.582 --> 01:11:02.457
What is this?

756
01:11:03.666 --> 01:11:06.291
- It's your essence, your spirit.

757
01:11:06.457 --> 01:11:09.541
Snake catcher, little demon.

758
01:11:09.707 --> 01:11:12.457
He's extinguishing us, body and soul.

759
01:11:12.624 --> 01:11:15.374
Once your soul scatters
away, you won't be able

760
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:16.957
to be reborn again.

761
01:11:17.124 --> 01:11:18.291
It is gone for good.

762
01:11:18.457 --> 01:11:20.582
- It's gone for good?

763
01:11:22.374 --> 01:11:27.041
- Quite true, sadly, and such
a waste now that I hear it.

764
01:11:27.207 --> 01:11:29.374
1 prefer having it over losing it.

765
01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:36.332
Once I've perfected my dark powers

766
01:11:36.499 --> 01:11:38.749
and reached a higher state of being,

767
01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:41.874
His Highness will then
see what I've achieved.

768
01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:45.707
I hold the secret to immortality.

769
01:11:49.332 --> 01:11:52.624
- Immortality, you brag
of knowing its secret,

770
01:11:52.791 --> 01:11:56.624
but all you're doing is
stealing ours, so do it.

771
01:12:07.832 --> 01:12:08.999
- What's this?

772
01:12:10.124 --> 01:12:12.582
That was foolish.

773
01:12:12.749 --> 01:12:14.666
You absorbed the Scorching Death Scales.

774
01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:18.957
It's nearly time, they're
just about to explode.

775
01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:35.832
- Not so difficult.

776
01:12:42.582 --> 01:12:45.499
I see this is your doing, witch.

777
01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:47.582
- You forced my hand.

778
01:12:47.749 --> 01:12:51.541
Today we're going to settle
things once and for all.

779
01:12:51.707 --> 01:12:52.374
- Master.

780
01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:46.874
Blanca!

781
01:13:51.999 --> 01:13:53.457
Way of fire.

782
01:13:54.416 --> 01:13:55.332
Mountainous earth!

783
01:13:58.457 --> 01:13:59.749
- Watch out!

784
01:14:39.874 --> 01:14:41.207
- Master, sister!

785
01:14:45.499 --> 01:14:46.749
Catch!

786
01:15:36.374 --> 01:15:37.082
- Blanca!

787
01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:43.457
- Kill them all.

788
01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:29.541
Secure the gate, hold strong!

789
01:16:52.582 --> 01:16:55.541
- Master, we've wiped out
our greatest enemy today.

790
01:16:55.707 --> 01:16:57.791
Please allow me to
return your hairpin now.

791
01:16:59.374 --> 01:17:00.207
- Hm.

792
01:17:01.332 --> 01:17:03.041
1 allowed your sister to take this

793
01:17:03.207 --> 01:17:05.707
to assassinate that Daoist.

794
01:17:05.874 --> 01:17:08.332
I never thought she'd
steal another's powers

795
01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:10.374
or turn into a giant snake.

796
01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:13.332
- Master, you have the wrong
idea, she really tried to--

797
01:17:13.499 --> 01:17:18.416
- The Daoist is gone, so ll no
longer have any use for this.

798
01:17:20.832 --> 01:17:21.582
- Why, master?

799
01:17:23.124 --> 01:17:26.499
- The Daoist did such cruel things to us.

800
01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:29.874
But one day, it was clear to me,

801
01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:31.832
anything he tried to master--

802
01:17:31.999 --> 01:17:32.666
- Sister.
- 1 could too.

803
01:17:32.832 --> 01:17:34.957
- Run.
- If he could take it,

804
01:17:35.124 --> 01:17:37.916
then I can take your essence just as well!

805
01:17:38.082 --> 01:17:40.624
- Sister!

806
01:18:00.957 --> 01:18:02.957
Master!

807
01:18:05.999 --> 01:18:06.832
- Blanca!

808
01:18:08.499 --> 01:18:09.832
- It's fortunate that you have newly

809
01:18:09.999 --> 01:18:12.249
gained strength, little demons.

810
01:18:12.416 --> 01:18:14.666
It's excellent fuel for my own.

811
01:18:16.499 --> 01:18:19.791
I'm glad I had the
foresight to lend it to you.

812
01:18:19.957 --> 01:18:23.124
All that is shared flows to the source.

813
01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:27.457
It all returns to me!

814
01:20:04.291 --> 01:20:05.749
Blanca.

815
01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:06.666
- Xuan.

816
01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:10.166
She drained all of the power I had left.

817
01:20:13.166 --> 01:20:14.999
- Guess you can't push me away again.

818
01:20:32.874 --> 01:20:37.874
Blanca!

819
01:20:56.124 --> 01:20:56.874
Watch out!

820
01:21:06.707 --> 01:21:07.457
Blanca!

821
01:21:09.749 --> 01:21:12.374
Wait, the woman and the net.

822
01:21:13.666 --> 01:21:16.332
Constellations.

823
01:21:17.707 --> 01:21:19.249
There's the heart, the ghost,

824
01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:21.541
southwest horn, chariot, wing.

825
01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.457
So the door of life is...

826
01:21:30.457 --> 01:21:31.291
Over there!

827
01:21:58.707 --> 01:21:59.707
- What are we waiting for?

828
01:21:59.874 --> 01:22:02.041
We have to hurry and save Xuan.

829
01:22:02.207 --> 01:22:04.291
- We can't go, they're demons, right?

830
01:22:04.457 --> 01:22:07.166
- Yeah, and we just saw that
the girl in white is too.

831
01:22:08.916 --> 01:22:10.041
- It's still Xuan though!

832
01:22:10.207 --> 01:22:12.624
- He was once, not now.

833
01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:14.374
- That's right, we could've all just died.

834
01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:16.957
1 tell ya, if we free those
two, it's certain death.

835
01:22:17.124 --> 01:22:18.249
It's just not worth it.

836
01:22:18.416 --> 01:22:21.666
If Xuan didn't
save you, you'd be dead now!

837
01:22:21.832 --> 01:22:23.041
Dudou's a demon too!

838
01:22:23.207 --> 01:22:24.082
A dog demon!

839
01:22:24.249 --> 01:22:26.624
- And so what, who cares
if we're not like you,

840
01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:29.207
we risked our lives to save you!

841
01:22:43.457 --> 01:22:44.291
- Xuan.

842
01:22:45.207 --> 01:22:46.041
- Huh?

843
01:22:57.874 --> 01:23:01.707
All of their souls were drained away.

844
01:23:03.957 --> 01:23:07.457
- If we stay, we'll both have our souls

845
01:23:07.624 --> 01:23:09.124
extinguished as well.

846
01:23:21.582 --> 01:23:24.416
- Don't worry, the villagers,

847
01:23:24.582 --> 01:23:25.749
they'll save us for sure.

848
01:23:29.582 --> 01:23:31.082
- Xuan.
- Huh?

849
01:23:31.249 --> 01:23:35.624
- You said on the river that life is short

850
01:23:35.791 --> 01:23:37.082
and sorrows long.

851
01:23:39.166 --> 01:23:43.457
So we should just focus
on the good things.

852
01:23:43.624 --> 01:23:44.374
- Right.

853
01:23:45.332 --> 01:23:46.707
Remember,

854
01:23:48.291 --> 01:23:51.207
those dandelions and the ferry?

855
01:23:52.874 --> 01:23:53.707
And that tower?

856
01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.416
- I can see it all.

857
01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:05.582
- You can?

858
01:24:09.291 --> 01:24:10.374
Great.

859
01:24:41.332 --> 01:24:42.541
- What's that?

860
01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:44.499
Xuan, listen.

861
01:24:45.666 --> 01:24:47.749
Someone's trying to break through.

862
01:24:49.124 --> 01:24:49.957
Xuan?

863
01:24:53.957 --> 01:24:54.791
Xuan, no.

864
01:24:55.999 --> 01:24:56.832
Xuan!

865
01:25:00.999 --> 01:25:01.832
Xuan!

866
01:25:05.666 --> 01:25:07.082
You can't!

867
01:25:07.249 --> 01:25:08.249
Please, Xuan.

868
01:25:10.374 --> 01:25:13.707
Didn't you say that we'd leave together?

869
01:25:15.249 --> 01:25:18.124
That we'd set out to the ends of the Earth

870
01:25:18.291 --> 01:25:20.124
and see so many places?

871
01:25:27.749 --> 01:25:28.582
Don't go!

872
01:25:29.582 --> 01:25:30.582
Don't go!

873
01:25:37.624 --> 01:25:39.874
Please don't, Xuan.

874
01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:40.791
Don't go.

- Blanca, whatever happens, I'll be there.

Our lives are short--
> Can't you see)

881

Xuan!

902
01:28:02.082 --> 01:28:04.082
- Do you see Xuan?

903
01:28:04.249 --> 01:28:04.999
- Xuan!

904
01:28:06.124 --> 01:28:07.624
Xuan!

managed to save his soul.

01:28:25.916 --> 01:28:27.291
He's in the hairpin though.

908
01:28:27.457 --> 01:28:30.291
- It cost you dearly,
you were a shake again.

909
01:28:32.166 --> 01:28:34.666
- Using what little strength I had left,

910
01:28:34.832 --> 01:28:37.791
I sealed the memories of
what occurred into this.

911
01:28:40.207 --> 01:28:43.457
- Today you've unlocked it as last.

912
01:28:49.582 --> 01:28:54.249
- Even if I did, immortality
is something I can't reach.

913
01:28:56.082 --> 01:28:57.332
- It hasn't freed you?

914
01:28:59.916 --> 01:29:04.124
- That second of joy, held for 500 years.

915
01:29:04.291 --> 01:29:05.374
- Was it worth it?

916
01:29:07.499 --> 01:29:11.499
- Even if it cost 1,000
years, it was worth it.

917
01:29:22.374 --> 01:29:23.707
- I'll always be with you.

918
01:29:30.874 --> 01:29:32.541
- Xuan, where is he?

919
01:29:34.041 --> 01:29:37.041
- His soul survived and reincarnated,

920
01:29:37.207 --> 01:29:38.416
it's out there somewhere.

921
01:29:42.166 --> 01:29:43.374
- L1 have to find it.

922
01:29:46.207 --> 01:29:48.499
Whoever he is
now, he's already lived

923
01:29:48.666 --> 01:29:50.832
through so many lifetimes.

924
01:29:50.999 --> 01:29:54.624
Even if you do find him, he
may not be how you remember.

925
01:30:02.582 --> 01:30:04.082
- Wherever he is in the world,

926
01:30:05.582 --> 01:30:07.332
whatever he looks like,

927
01:30:09.707 --> 01:30:13.957
whether he remembers me or
not, I have to find him.

928
01:30:17.082 --> 01:30:18.916
After all, I remember.

929
01:30:39.499 --> 01:30:42.707
Look at that.

930
01:30:42.874 --> 01:30:44.332
- Hey, wait!

931
01:30:44.499 --> 01:30:45.374
Wait, wait.

932
01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:47.749
Wait a second, hold up!

933
01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:52.707
Honestly,
you're so forgetful.

934
01:30:54.207 --> 01:30:55.374
- Thank you, brother.

935
01:30:55.541 --> 01:30:57.582
Yeah, yeah,
you're oh your own.

936
01:30:58.957 --> 01:31:01.249
- He seems to have time now.
- Excuse me.

937
01:31:05.874 --> 01:31:06.707
- Hm?

938
01:31:17.582 --> 01:31:18.416
Excuse me.

939
01:31:21.582 --> 01:31:22.416
Miss.

940
01:31:23.957 --> 01:31:25.166
Miss.

941
01:31:25.332 --> 01:31:26.499
You dropped your hairpin.

942
01:31:37.791 --> 01:31:39.207
- Thank you, sir.

943
01:31:43.957 --> 01:31:45.707
- It looks very old.

944
01:31:45.874 --> 01:31:48.041
Is it valuable?
- It is.

945
01:31:48.207 --> 01:31:49.874
Thank you again for picking it up.

946
01:31:50.041 --> 01:31:51.624
I'd really hate to lose it.

947
01:31:51.791 --> 01:31:55.082
You seem
like a lady of good standing.

948
01:31:55.249 --> 01:31:56.124
Where are you from?

949
01:31:57.291 --> 01:31:58.832
That's a long story.

950
01:35:16.957 --> 01:35:21.457
> Why does)

951
01:35:21.624 --> 01:35:26.541

Q> It brings the wind)

953
01:35:32.999 --> 01:35:37.916
> And galloping rain)

954
01:35:39.249 --> 01:35:43.124
> Though spring)

955
01:35:43.291 --> 01:35:48.207
> Does not grow old)

956
01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:53.499
> We feel)

957
01:35:53.666 --> 01:35:56.082
<i>> That it may »</i>

958
01:36:14.791 --> 01:36:18.499
> Yet this is J

959
01:36:18.666 --> 01:36:22.916
> A worldly fear)

960
01:36:31.332 --> 01:36:35.832
Did you
find what I was looking for?

960
01:36:36.305 --> 01:37:36.598
