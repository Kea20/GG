<b>The forests of Pandora
hold many dangers.</b>


2
00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:37.626
<b>But the most dangerous
thing about Pandora,</b>


3
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460
<b>is that you may grow to
love her too much.</b>


4
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.710
<b>We sing the song chords to remember.
Each bead, a story in our life.</b>


5
00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.043
<b>A bead for the birth of our son.</b>

6
00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:13.001
<b>Neteyam!</b>

7
00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:14.960
<b>Neteyam!</b>

8
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:25.001
<b>A bead when we adopted our
daughter, Kiri,</b>


9
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.125
<b>born of Grace's avatar, -</b>

10
00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:32.126
<b>a daughter who's conception
was a total mystery.</b>


11
00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:48.668
<b>A bead for the first
communion with Eywa.</b>


12
00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:55.543
<b>The people say we
live in Eywa, -</b>


13
00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.293
<b>and Eywa lives in us.</b>

14
00:03:01.543 --> 00:03:06.543
<b>The great mother holds all
her children in her heart.</b>


15
00:03:14.543 --> 00:03:16.543
<b>Happiness is simple.</b>

16
00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:20.876
<b>But who would've thought
a jarhead like me could crack the code.</b>


17
00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:26.668
<b>When I met your father...</b>

18
00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:28.543
<b>... I tried to kill him.</b>

19
00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:30.501
<b>It was love at first sight.</b>

20
00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:33.918
<b>Before I knew it, we had four.</b>

21
00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:40.542
<b>When we sent the sky people back to
Earth, a few of them stayed.</b>


22
00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:43.543
<b>Science guys loyal to the Na'vi.</b>

23
00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:48.210
<b>And then there was Spider.
He was just stuck here.</b>


24
00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:50.167
<b>Too young for a cryocapsule.</b>

25
00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:51.168
<b>You wild man.</b>

26
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:52.418
<b>Hey Norm.</b>

27
00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.750
<b>Orphaned by the war,

28

<b>Spider, take your spare!</b>

29
00:03:55.918 --> 00:03:57.376
<b>I'm just going to the village.</b>

30
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:03.168
<b>He wasn't part of our family.
He was like a stray cat just always around.</b>


31
00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:07.543
<b>Inseperable from our kids.</b>

32
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:15.418
<b>To Neytiri he would always
be alien. One of them.</b>


33
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.085
<b>He belongs with his own kind.</b>

34
00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:23.543
<b>It's mine!</b>

35
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.710
<b>I had it first!</b>

36
00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:26.625
<b>Why do I have
to give it to you?</b>

37
00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:27.460
<b>Took a few years
to get the language -</b>

38
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.686
<b>- through my thick skull.</b>
<b>- It's mine!</b>


39
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.292
<b>Lo'ak, you liar! 
Give it to me!</b>

40
00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:31.251
<b>But now when I hear it,</b>

41
00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:32.917
<b>might as well be English.</b>

42
00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:34.542
<b>I hate you!</b>

43
00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:38.542
<b>I hate you times infinity!
Lo'ak! Penis face!</b>


44
00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:40.918
<b>Hey, hey, that's enough.</b>

45
00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:42.543
<b>Don't make me come over there.</b>

46
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.459
<b>He's gonna come out from behind
those big rocks.</b>


47
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.543
<b>There he is.</b>

48
00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:50.543
<b>There you go. 
Go get it.</b>

49
00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:57.626
<b>Neteyam, the mighty
fisherman. Good boy.</b>


50
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.751
<b>- It's a big one.
- By the rocks, right where you said.</b>


51
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.210
<b>How tall is he?</b>

52
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:09.210
<b>He's that tall.</b>

53
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.251
<b>Goes by too fast. 
Like a dream.</b>

54
00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:16.585
<b>- Kiri.
- Come here, bro.</b>


55
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.585
<b>Smile, skxawng.</b>

56
00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:21.335
<b>Happiness is simple.</b>

57
00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:27.376
<b>Like date night,</b>
<b>time away from the kids.</b>


58
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.543
<b>But the thing about happiness.</b>

59
00:06:03.543 --> 00:06:05.543
<b>It can vanish in a heartbeat.</b>

60
00:06:11.543 --> 00:06:13.543
<b>A new star in the night.</b>

61
00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:17.543
<b>That could only mean one thing.</b>

62
00:06:23.543 --> 00:06:26.543
<b>Ships decelerating.</b>

63
00:06:34.543 --> 00:06:36.585

67
00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:13.543
<b>You're fine.</b>
<b>Stay calm.</b>


68
00:09:15.543 --> 00:09:17.543
<b>Good pupillary reaction.</b>

69

70
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:24.001
<b>Colonel?</b>

71
00:09:26.543 --> 00:09:27.783
<b>You need to lie back down, sir.</b>

72
00:09:33.168 --> 00:09:34.208
<b>Sedate him! 
Sedate him!</b>

73
00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:36.376

<b>I'm alright.</b>

82
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:30.543
<b>Well, ain't this a bitch.</b>

83
00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:42.834
<b>Stand By. Two minutes

<b>Powers that be thought it prudent

<b>Just in case.</b>

92

<b>And if you're watching, well it means

93

<b>Hey, Parker, just what the

94

<b>- Hurry it up.</b>
<b>- Hurry it up.</b>


102
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.667
<b>Anyway, the idea is,</b>

103

<b>to get the minds of the

104
00:11:41.543 --> 00:11:47.542
<b>Yeah, like Corporal Wainfleet over

<b>And with our training,

<b>- Tuk, go with her.
- Father, I take full responsibility.</b>


171
00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:08.376
<b>Yes, because you are the older brother,</b>
<b>you gotta act like it.</b>


172
00:18:09.376 --> 00:18:14.585
<b>- MaJake, your son is actually bleeding.
- Mother, it's fine, I -</b>


173
00:18:16.376 --> 00:18:17.709
<b>Go and get patched up.</b>

174
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.710
<b>Go on, dismissed.</b>

175
00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:27.585
<b>You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.</b>


176
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.710
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

177
00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:33.335
<b>You're grounded.
No flying for a month.</b>


178
00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:38.376
<b>Now see to the Ikrans. All of them.
And get that crap off your face.</b>


179
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:49.376
<b>- Aw! A little kiss on the boo boo.
- Give him this.</b>


180
00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:55.335
<b>- I would use yalnabark.
- Oh you would? And who is Tsahik?</b>


181
00:18:55.376 --> 00:18:59.376
<b>You are, grandma, move. You
are, grandma but yalnabark is better.</b>


182
00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:05.376
<b>- It stings less.
- Mighty warriors.</b>


183
00:19:12.376 --> 00:19:14.376
<b>What is it?</b>

184
00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:20.335
<b>Neteyam and Lo'ak try
to live up to you.</b>


185
00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:23.335
<b>It's hard for them.</b>

186
00:19:23.376 --> 00:19:25.376
<b>I know.</b>

187
00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:28.376
<b>You are hard on them.</b>

188
00:19:31.376 --> 00:19:35.335
<b>I am their father.
That's my job.</b>


189
00:19:35.376 --> 00:19:38.376
<b>This is not a squad.
It is a family.</b>


190
00:19:50.376 --> 00:19:52.376
<b>I thought we had lost him.</b>

191
00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:03.335
<b>- Hi there.
- Hey, Spider.</b>


192
00:20:03.376 --> 00:20:06.335
<b>- Your ass is mine.
- I'm right here.</b>


193
00:20:06.376 --> 00:20:09.376
<b>Avatars only. 
Go around.</b>

194
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:14.376
<b>- The blue stripes don't make you any bigger bro.
- I can still kick your ass.</b>


195
00:20:18.376 --> 00:20:21.376
<b>- Hell of a day.
- Home run.</b>


196
00:20:22.376 --> 00:20:25.167
<b>Yeah, haha. 
Real hysterical guys.</b>

197
00:20:25.168 --> 00:20:26.542
<b>You know what really sucks though.</b>

198
00:20:26.543 --> 00:20:28.375
<b>You can breathe Earth air for hours.</b>

199
00:20:28.376 --> 00:20:30.375
<b>I can only breathe
your air for like ten seconds.</b>


200
00:20:30.376 --> 00:20:33.875
<b>Yes, monkey boy. 
That really sucks,</b>

201
00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:35.376
<b>For you.</b>

202
00:20:41.376 --> 00:20:43.375
<b>- Hey, Max.
- Hey, kids.</b>


203
00:20:43.376 --> 00:20:45.209
<b>Hey, what's up Max.</b>

204
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.210
<b>Lo'ak.</b>

205
00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:53.376
<b>Hi Mom.</b>

206
00:21:02.376 --> 00:21:07.335
<b>Maybe I'm just losing it out here
but I see real evidence -</b>


207
00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:11.376
<b>of a systemic response
on a global level.</b>


208
00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:14.335
<b>I can not...</b>

209
00:21:14.376 --> 00:21:18.335
<b>I will not use the
word "intelligence".</b>


210
00:21:18.376 --> 00:21:21.335
<b>"Awareness" is
probably a better word.</b>


211
00:21:21.376 --> 00:21:25.335
<b>It's as if the entire
biosphere on Pandora -</b>


212
00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:30.376
<b>is aware and capable
of this cognitive response.</b>


213
00:21:31.376 --> 00:21:36.210
<b>Oh crap, I can't say that.
They'll crucify me.</b>


214
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:40.335
<b>So, who do you think</b>
<b>knocked her up?</b>


215
00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:44.335
<b>- Pretty sure it was Norm.
- Totally.</b>


216
00:21:44.376 --> 00:21:47.375
<b>- You don't deserve to live.
- Think about it.</b>


217
00:21:47.376 --> 00:21:49.459
<b>He is the teachers pet.</b>

218
00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.376
<b>He's out at the lab
with her all the time.</b>

219
00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:54.335
<b>I would kill myself.
I would drink acid.</b>


220
00:21:54.376 --> 00:21:56.875
<b>Bro, you're right! 
He's like in every shot.</b>

221
00:21:56.876 --> 00:21:59.084
<b>Look, he's giving her the looks!</b>

222
00:21:59.085 --> 00:22:00.085
<b>Hey!</b>

223
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:04.293
<b>See, I'm thinking their two avatars
together out in the woods…</b>


224
00:22:04.418 --> 00:22:05.418
<b>... All alone.</b>

225
00:22:05.418 --> 00:22:06.210
<b>Gross!</b>

226
00:22:06.376 --> 00:22:10.376
<b>Guys, I mean, Sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.</b>


227
00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:18.335
<b>Whatever. I don't
even remember him.</b>


228
00:22:18.376 --> 00:22:19.500
<b>No, Spider...</b>

229
00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:20.335
<b>Dude.</b>

230
00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:23.375
<b>Spider...</b>

231
00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:26.376
<b>You are not him.</b>

232
00:22:34.376 --> 00:22:37.376
<b>BRIDGEHEAD CITY</b>

233
00:23:05.876 --> 00:23:08.335
<b>Go! Go! Go! 
Inside the terminal!</b>

234
00:23:08.376 --> 00:23:11.376
<b>No stay! Go!</b>

235
00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:16.376
<b>Masks off.</b>

236
00:23:20.376 --> 00:23:23.376
<b>Colonel, it's the general.</b>

237
00:23:32.376 --> 00:23:33.376
<b>General Ardmore.</b>

238
00:23:34.376 --> 00:23:38.335
<b>Nice to meet you, Colonel.
I hear good things.</b>


239
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:42.376
<b>But a lot has changed since
your last tour here. Walk with me.</b>


240
00:23:45.126 --> 00:23:49.335
<b>The new command center,</b>
<b>it's over here, that just came online.</b>


241
00:23:49.376 --> 00:23:53.335
<b>The sworn assemblers can put up
a building in six days.</b>


242
00:23:53.376 --> 00:23:58.375
<b>We have done more here in a year
than in the previous thirty years.</b>


243
00:23:58.376 --> 00:24:05.376
<b>We are not here to run a mine, Colonel. As on world
commander, I have been charged with a greater mission.</b>


244
00:24:09.376 --> 00:24:11.335
<b>Earth is dying.</b>

245
00:24:12.043 --> 00:24:15.335
<b>Our task here is to tame this frontier.</b>

246
00:24:16.501 --> 00:24:20.376
<b>Nothing less than to make Pandora</b>
<b>the new home for humanity.</b>


247
00:24:21.376 --> 00:24:26.376
<b>But before we can do that, we
need to pacify the hostiles</b>


248
00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:32.335
<b>Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.</b>


249
00:24:32.376 --> 00:24:37.375
<b>His attacks are well executed. Got tight
coordination between his ground and air assets.</b>


250
00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:43.335
<b>These forces are hitting our outline sites.</b>
<b>Mines, Pipelines, cutting off our supply chain.</b>


251
00:24:43.376 --> 00:24:47.376
<b>They hit a mag
train two days ago.</b>


252
00:24:51.376 --> 00:24:56.376
<b>- Any intel on Sully's base of operations?
- Yeah. Bring up the mountains.</b>


253
00:24:57.376 --> 00:25:00.376
<b>It's a cave system in
the Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.</b>


254
00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:06.376
<b>But every time we send our forces
up there, we take losses.</b>


255
00:25:07.293 --> 00:25:10.376
<b>Our hardware really
stirs up the hornets nest.</b>


256
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.376
<b>We only get ten minutes in enemy
airspace they are all over us.</b>


257
00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:21.335
<b>Colonel, we believe your blue team
will be perceived as indigenous-</b>


258
00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:24.335
<b>and will not trigger
the immune response.</b>


259
00:25:24.376 --> 00:25:27.376
<b>And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?</b>


260
00:25:28.376 --> 00:25:30.376
<b>The hard way.</b>

261
00:25:31.376 --> 00:25:33.376
<b>Outstanding.</b>

262
00:25:46.376 --> 00:25:50.376
<b>- We are entering hostile airspace.
- Copy that.</b>


263
00:26:00.751 --> 00:26:03.668
<b>- Go, monkey boy!
- Guys! Wait up!</b>


264
00:26:40.376 --> 00:26:44.335
<b>- Tuk, come on.
- Okay, okay.</b>


265
00:26:44.376 --> 00:26:46.335
<b>Bro why did you bring her anyway?</b>

266
00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:51.335
<b>She's such a crybaby. "I'm telling. You're
not supposed to go to the battlefield.</b>"


267
00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.334
<b>I'll tell mom if
you don't let me come."</b>

268
00:26:53.335 --> 00:26:54.376
<b>Don't pick on her.</b>

269
00:26:56.376 --> 00:26:57.376
<b>Come on.</b>

270
00:26:58.376 --> 00:27:02.960
<b>- Oh sick!
- Are there any dead bodies up there?</b>


271
00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:50.376
<b>No shit.</b>

272
00:28:00.376 --> 00:28:03.376
<b>Kiri? Kiri.</b>

273
00:28:06.376 --> 00:28:08.376
<b>Kiri. Kiri...</b>

274
00:28:15.376 --> 00:28:19.335
<b>- Are you okay?
- I was doing that thing again, wasn't I?</b>


275
00:28:19.376 --> 00:28:21.376
<b>Yeah, you were.</b>

276
00:28:22.376 --> 00:28:23.625
<b>Tuk 
- Kiri!</b>

277
00:28:23.626 --> 00:28:24.335
<b>Lo'ak 
- Kiri!</b>

278
00:28:24.376 --> 00:28:26.710
<b>- Kiri, we have to get back.
- Come on.</b>


279
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:34.210
<b>What is it?</b>

280
00:28:34.251 --> 00:28:36.210
<b>We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.</b>


281
00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:42.210
<b>- Way too big for a human.
- Avatars?</b>


282
00:28:42.251 --> 00:28:45.251
<b>Maybe, they're for sure not ours.</b>

283
00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:49.251
<b>- What are you doing?
- Shh, I'm tracking.</b>


284
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:10.251
<b>Watch your six.</b>

285
00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.251
<b>Clear.</b>

286
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:19.251
<b>Moving up.</b>

287
00:29:32.251 --> 00:29:34.251
<b>Damn.</b>

288
00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:58.210
<b>We are never supposed to come here.</b>

289
00:29:58.251 --> 00:30:00.250
<b>Dad is going to ground you.</b>

290
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:01.792
<b>- Dad is going to ground you.</b>
<b>- Shhhhh. Stop.</b>


291
00:30:01.793 --> 00:30:03.250
<b>For life.</b>

292
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:07.251
<b>Bro, we have got to
check this out, let's go.</b>


293
00:30:23.251 --> 00:30:29.210
<b>Bro, that's where your
dad and my dad fought.</b>


294
00:30:29.251 --> 00:30:33.251
<b>- That's your dads actual suit.
- Holy shit...</b>


295
00:30:34.335 --> 00:30:38.085
<b>Lyle, see if you can pull
some data off that dashcam.</b>


296
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:42.251
<b>- Thing is deader than shit, Colonel.
- So were we.</b>


297
00:30:43.251 --> 00:30:46.334
<b>- Better call this in.
- No bro, we're gonna get in trouble.</b>


298
00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:47.335
<b>Let's go.</b>

299
00:30:52.251 --> 00:30:56.251
<b>- Devil Dog, This is Eagle Eye, over.
- Eagle Eye, send your traffic.</b>


300
00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:02.210
<b>I've got eyes on some guys.</b>
<b>They look like avatars-</b>


301
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:07.210
<b>but they're in full camo and carrying
AR's. There are six of them, over.</b>

<b>What's your pos, over?</b>

303
00:31:10.251 --> 00:31:13.251
<b>We are at the old shack.</b>

304
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:17.210
<b>Who's we?</b>

305
00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:20.251
<b>Me, Spider, Kiri...</b>

306

<b>Son, you listen to me very
carefully. Pull back right now.</b>


308
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.250
<b>Do not make a sound.</b>

309
00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:35.875
<b>- Get the hell out of there. Move, copy?
- Yes sir, moving out.</b>


310
00:31:35.876 --> 00:31:37.251
<b>See I told you.</b>

311
00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:40.251
<b>Dad, I know a quick way!</b>

312

<b>- You're going to be in so much trouble.

317
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:03.918

00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:26.251
<b>Shut up!</b>

334
00:33:29.251 --> 00:33:34.251
<b>- Kiri!
- No! Stop! Hey! Hey! Don't touch her!</b>


335
00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:37.251
<b>Don't hurt her please.</b>

336
00:33:39.251 --> 00:33:42.251
<b>- Don't move.
- What's your name, kid?</b>


337
00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:48.251
<b>Spider, Socorro.</b>

338
00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:58.251
<b>Miles?</b>

339
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:03.251
<b>Nobody calls me that.</b>

340
00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:10.251
<b>I'll be damned. I figured
they sent you back to Earth.</b>


341
00:34:12.251 --> 00:34:15.251
<b>You can't put babies in cryo, dipshit.</b>

342
00:34:21.251 --> 00:34:23.251
<b>What do we do, boss?</b>

343
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:28.251
<b>Iron Sky, Blue on Actual</b>

344
00:34:32.251 --> 00:34:36.251
<b>- Blue on Iron Sky, send your traffic.
- We are standing by for extract, over.</b>


345
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:39.625
<b>- Take us in.
- Dragonfly coming left.</b>


346
00:34:39.626 --> 00:34:41.251
<b>We are go for extract.</b>

347
00:34:41.543 --> 00:34:43.834
<b>Be advised. We're bringing
high value prisoners.</b>


348
00:34:43.835 --> 00:34:44.543
<b>Let us go!</b>

349
00:34:44.543 --> 00:34:45.251
<b>Shut up!</b>

350
00:34:45.252 --> 00:34:49.250
<b>- Sit tight, we're inbound.
- Bingo in ten.</b>


351
00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:51.251
<b>We're on the clock.</b>

352
00:34:56.251 --> 00:34:59.251
<b>Lyle, get me some audio on this.</b>

353
00:35:02.251 --> 00:35:06.250
<b>- It's Sully's woman.
- She's a wild animal.</b>


354
00:35:06.251 --> 00:35:09.210
<b>Give up, Quaritch.</b>

355
00:35:09.251 --> 00:35:12.251
<b>- Sully.
- It's all over.</b>


356
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:16.210
<b>Nothing's over
while I'm breathing.</b>


357
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:18.251
<b>I was hoping you would say that.</b>

358
00:35:35.251 --> 00:35:38.334
<b>- You stay with the Ikrans.
- Dad, I'm a warrior like you.</b>


359
00:35:38.335 --> 00:35:39.293
<b>I'm supposed to fight.</b>

360
00:35:39.293 --> 00:35:40.210
<b>Neyteyam.</b>

361
00:35:40.251 --> 00:35:41.251
<b>I won't say it again.</b>

362
00:35:43.251 --> 00:35:45.251
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

363
00:36:07.251 --> 00:36:10.251
<b>There is nothing after that.</b>

364
00:36:22.251 --> 00:36:25.251
<b>Should we salvage the remains?</b>

365
00:36:51.251 --> 00:36:53.251
<b>Blue 1, we'll be there
in three minutes.</b>


366
00:36:54.251 --> 00:36:56.251
<b>Three minutes.</b>

367
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:12.251
<b>Watch our 6.</b>

368
00:38:01.251 --> 00:38:02.251
<b>Shut up!</b>

369
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:18.251
<b>Shut up.</b>

370
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:22.251
<b>Contact made!</b>

371
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:27.251
<b>Lo'ak!</b>

372
00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:33.210
<b>You little shit!</b>

373
00:38:33.251 --> 00:38:36.251
<b>- Tuk, come on!
- Race!</b>


374
00:38:44.251 --> 00:38:46.210
<b>Come along!</b>

375
00:38:46.251 --> 00:38:48.251
<b>In cover!</b>

376
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:52.251
<b>Come now!</b>

377
00:39:07.251 --> 00:39:13.251
<b>Is that you, Mrs. Sully? I
recognize your calling card.</b>


378
00:39:22.251 --> 00:39:29.251
<b>Come on out, Mrs. Sully. The
two of us have some unfinished business.</b>


379
00:39:34.251 --> 00:39:38.251
<b>Demon! I will kill you as
many times as I have to.</b>


380
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:43.250
<b>You and the Corporal have been
pretty busy, haven't you?</b>


381
00:39:43.251 --> 00:39:48.251
<b>Got yourself a whole
litter of half-breeds.</b>


382
00:39:56.835 --> 00:39:58.251
<b>Na'vi!</b>

383
00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:03.251
<b>Go! Go! Go!</b>

384
00:40:04.251 --> 00:40:08.251
<b>Are you okay, boy?
Follow me. Ready?! Ready?!</b>


385
00:40:11.251 --> 00:40:12.251
<b>Move!</b>

386
00:40:16.251 --> 00:40:17.251
<b>Come on!</b>

387
00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:29.251
<b>- Go! Go! Go!
- After them!</b>


388
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:37.251
<b>Spider?</b>

389
00:40:41.251 --> 00:40:44.210
<b>- Spider!
- Kiri!</b>


390
00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:46.210
<b>Come here!</b>

391
00:40:46.251 --> 00:40:48.251
<b>Spider is down there!</b>

392
00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:59.251
<b>- Then we are ahead. We have ten minutes.
- Blue 1, back to the collection point.</b>


393
00:41:07.251 --> 00:41:09.251
<b>- Blue 1, fall back.
- Back!</b>


394
00:41:10.251 --> 00:41:12.251
<b>Back, back! Take off!</b>

395
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:19.210
<b>Kiri, come on! Come on!</b>

396
00:41:19.251 --> 00:41:21.251
<b>Run, run, run!</b>

397
00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:25.250
<b>- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.</b>


398
00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:27.251
<b>Tuk, are you hurt?</b>

399
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:49.210
<b>There we're clear.
Is everyone okay?</b>


400
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:51.251
<b>Tuk!</b>

401
00:41:54.251 --> 00:41:56.210
<b>It's okay.</b>

402
00:41:56.251 --> 00:42:00.251
<b>Thank you, Great Mother, thank you.</b>

403
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:03.210
<b>Where is Spider?</b>

404
00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:07.250
<b>They took him. 
They took him.</b>

405
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:12.251
<b>Take it easy, honey.
He's a tough kid.</b>


406
00:42:14.251 --> 00:42:16.251
<b>He'll be okay.</b>

407
00:42:17.251 --> 00:42:20.251
<b>We're all gonna be okay.</b>

408
00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:35.585
<b>Let me out!</b>

409
00:42:43.585 --> 00:42:48.585
<b>He's completely ferile.
He thinks he is one of them.</b>


410
00:42:51.585 --> 00:42:56.585
<b>This thing, this Quaritch, whatever he is,
he can walk right in here under Eywa's nose.</b>


411
00:42:57.585 --> 00:43:01.543
<b>- This is our family. This is our home.</b>
<b>- This is our family. It's about our little ones.</b>


412
00:43:01.585 --> 00:43:04.585
<b>I can not. You can not ask this.</b>

413
00:43:06.585 --> 00:43:10.543
<b>I cannot leave my
people. I will not.</b>


414
00:43:10.585 --> 00:43:14.543
<b>He's hunting us. He's
targeting our family.</b>


415
00:43:14.585 --> 00:43:21.293
<b>You can not ask this. The children, everything
they've ever known, the forest. This is our home!</b>


416
00:43:21.585 --> 00:43:25.585
<b>He had our children. He
had them under his knife.</b>


417
00:43:31.585 --> 00:43:35.543
<b>My father gave me this bow
as he lay dying.</b>


418
00:43:35.585 --> 00:43:41.543
<b>He said to protect the
people. You are Toruk Makto!</b>


419
00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:46.543
<b>This will protect the people. Quaritch
has Spider and that kid knows everything.</b>


420
00:43:46.585 --> 00:43:49.543
<b>- He knows our whole operation.</b>
<b>- He can lead them right in here.</b>


421
00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:53.543
<b>If the people harbor us,
they will die.</b>


422
00:43:54.293 --> 00:43:55.585
<b>Do you understand?</b>

423
00:43:59.585 --> 00:44:03.585
<b>I got nothing. 
I got no plan.</b>

424
00:44:05.585 --> 00:44:07.500
<b>But I can protect this family,</b>

425
00:44:07.501 --> 00:44:08.585
<b>that I can do.</b>

426
00:44:22.585 --> 00:44:23.585
<b>But I know one thing.</b>

427
00:44:26.585 --> 00:44:31.585
<b>Wherever we go,
This family is our fortress.</b>


428
00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:47.585
<b>- Where's Jake Sully?
- I do not know!</b>


429
00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:51.543
<b>- We know, you know.
- I do not know!</b>


430
00:44:52.085 --> 00:44:56.126
<b>Form a picture in your mind. Is
it one of the floating mountains?</b>


431
00:44:56.585 --> 00:44:59.585
<b>- Let me outta here!
- He's fighting this, give us a minute.</b>


432
00:45:00.585 --> 00:45:03.543
<b>Form a thought, and we'll see it.</b>

433
00:45:03.585 --> 00:45:08.543
<b>- I do not know!
- I don't like this anymore than you do.</b>


434
00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:12.960
<b>- Which clans would be harboring him.
- I don't know! You're gonna have to kill me.</b>


435
00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:16.585
<b>Watch this he's peaking all over.</b>

436
00:45:17.585 --> 00:45:19.834
<b>It won't stop until you</b>
<b>give us something.</b>


437
00:45:19.835 --> 00:45:21.543
<b>Where is he?</b>

438
00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.210
<b>I don't know, you butt holes.</b>

439
00:45:23.918 --> 00:45:24.918
<b>I don't know!</b>

440
00:45:38.585 --> 00:45:41.585
<b>General, let me try the personal angle.</b>

441
00:45:45.585 --> 00:45:47.585
<b>He is not your son.</b>

442
00:46:18.585 --> 00:46:20.585
<b>Easy, tiger, easy.</b>

443
00:46:29.585 --> 00:46:31.585
<b>We good?</b>

444
00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:42.543
<b>Kid, you got heart. The science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard -</b>


445
00:46:42.585 --> 00:46:45.585
<b>but you gave them nothing.</b>

446
00:46:46.585 --> 00:46:49.585
<b>I respect that.</b>

447
00:46:53.585 --> 00:46:55.585
<b>I thought you might want this.</b>

448
00:47:03.585 --> 00:47:06.543
<b>This is Colonel Miles
Quaritch. Deceased.</b>


449
00:47:06.585 --> 00:47:09.585
<b>Killed in action.</b>

450
00:47:14.585 --> 00:47:16.543
<b>I'm not that man.</b>

451
00:47:16.585 --> 00:47:20.585
<b>But I do have his memories.</b>

452
00:47:23.585 --> 00:47:26.543
<b>Enough to know that -</b>

453
00:47:26.585 --> 00:47:29.543
<b>well he wasn't always the
best father.</b>


454
00:47:29.585 --> 00:47:32.543
<b>But that is not an apology.</b>

455
00:47:32.585 --> 00:47:37.585
<b>I'm not your father. Technically,
you and I, we're nothing to each other.</b>


456
00:47:38.585 --> 00:47:43.585
<b>But I can help you. I
can get you out of here.</b>


457
00:47:48.585 --> 00:47:52.584
<b>I won't ask you to betray Jake Sully.
You would never do that. You are loyal.</b>


458
00:47:52.585 --> 00:47:57.543
<b>And I admire loyalty.</b>

459
00:47:57.585 --> 00:48:00.585
<b>Now just ride along.</b>

460
00:48:01.585 --> 00:48:04.585
<b>Otherwise I gotta give</b>
<b>you back to the lab coats.</b>


461
00:48:13.585 --> 00:48:16.585
<b>This is like stones in my heart.</b>

462
00:48:17.585 --> 00:48:22.585
<b>Tarsem is young but wise. He
will become a strong olo'eyktan.</b>


463
00:48:24.585 --> 00:48:26.585
<b>The leader must die...</b>

464
00:48:30.585 --> 00:48:33.585
<b>so the leader can be born.</b>

465
00:48:35.251 --> 00:48:37.585
<b>Toruk Makto will disappear.</b>

466
00:48:39.585 --> 00:48:42.585
<b>The people will be safe.</b>

467
00:49:07.585 --> 00:49:12.585
<b>A father protects. It's what</b>
<b>gives him meaning.</b>


468
00:49:17.585 --> 00:49:19.543
<b>One life ends.</b>

469
00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:21.585
<b>Another begins.</b>

470
00:49:34.585 --> 00:49:36.585
<b>Oh, Tuk...</b>

471
00:49:40.585 --> 00:49:45.543
<b>The sea clans inhabit a world of
their own. Thousands of islands.</b>


472
00:49:45.585 --> 00:49:50.543
<b>An unknown area where we will be
able to disappear without a trace.</b>


473
00:49:50.585 --> 00:49:52.585
<b>Are we there yet?</b>

474
00:50:17.585 --> 00:50:20.585
<b>AWA'ATLU, IN METKAYINA

00:51:01.585 --> 00:51:03.585
<b>Follow me.</b>

477
00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:05.585
<b>Tuk.</b>

478
00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:08.585
<b>Behave nicely.</b>

479
00:51:09.585 --> 00:51:11.585
<b>Behave nicely.</b>

480
00:51:31.585 --> 00:51:33.543
<b>Take it easy. 
Just be cool.</b>

481
00:51:33.585 --> 00:51:36.585
<b>Look, what is that?</b>
<b>Is that supposed to be a tail?</b>


482
00:51:53.585 --> 00:51:56.543
<b>It is then too
small to swim with.</b>


483
00:51:56.585 --> 00:51:59.585
<b>Do not, Rotxo and Ao'nung.</b>

484
00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:02.585
<b>Hey.</b>

485
00:52:27.585 --> 00:52:32.543
<b>Tonowari was chief of the
Metkayina, the reef people.</b>


486
00:52:32.585 --> 00:52:35.585
<b>- I see you, Tonowari.
- Jake Sully.</b>


487
00:52:36.585 --> 00:52:39.585
<b>I knew him as a tough leader.</b>

488
00:52:42.585 --> 00:52:45.585
<b>But it wasn't Tonowari

489

<b>I see you, Ronal,

490

<b>- Why do you come to us, JakeSully.
- We seek Uturu.</b>


492
00:52:59.585 --> 00:53:03.585
<b>- Uturu?
- Asylum for my family.</b>


493
00:53:06.585 --> 00:53:11.543
<b>We are reef people. You are forest
people. Your skills will mean nothing here.</b>


494
00:53:11.585 --> 00:53:15.585
<b>So we will learn your ways, right?</b>

495
00:53:18.585 --> 00:53:20.585
<b>Their arms are thin.</b>

496
00:53:21.585 --> 00:53:26.585
<b>Their tails are weak. You
will be slow in the water.</b>


497

<b>The kids aren't even true Na'vi.</b>

498
00:53:34.585 --> 00:53:36.585
<b>Yes, we are.</b>

499
00:53:39.585 --> 00:53:40.751
<b>There is demon blood in them!</b>

500
00:53:45.585 --> 00:53:46.668
<b>Look.</b>

501
00:53:47.126 --> 00:53:48.126
<b>Look.</b>

502
00:53:48.585 --> 00:53:52.585
<b>I was born of the sky people and
now I am Na'vi. You can adapt.</b>


503
00:53:53.585 --> 00:53:56.543
<b>We will adapt.</b>

504
00:53:56.585 --> 00:53:59.585
<b>My husband was Toruk Makto.</b>

505
00:54:00.585 --> 00:54:06.585
<b>He led the clans to victory
over the Sky People.</b>


506
00:54:08.585 --> 00:54:10.250
<b>This you call victory?</b>

507
00:54:10.251 --> 00:54:12.751
<b>Hiding among strangers?</b>

508
00:54:16.585 --> 00:54:20.585
<b>It seems Eywa has turned
her back on you, Chosen One.</b>


509
00:54:26.585 --> 00:54:28.209
<b>I apologize for my mate.</b>

510
00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.500
<b>- She has flown a long way and is exhausted.</b>
<b>- Do not apologize for me.</b>


511
00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:32.585
<b>Jake.</b>

512
00:54:37.585 --> 00:54:43.543
<b>Toruk Makto is a great war
leader. All Na'vi people know his story.</b>


513
00:54:43.585 --> 00:54:45.625
<b>But we Metkayina -</b>

514
00:54:45.626 --> 00:54:46.210
<b>Dad</b>

515
00:54:46.211 --> 00:54:47.585
<b>are not at war.</b>

516
00:54:49.585 --> 00:54:52.543
<b>We can not let you bring</b>
<b>your war here.</b>


517
00:54:52.585 --> 00:54:55.543
<b>I'm done with war, okay?</b>

518
00:54:55.585 --> 00:54:59.585
<b>I just want to
keep my family safe.</b>


519
00:55:02.585 --> 00:55:05.585
<b>Uturu has been asked.</b>

520
00:55:09.585 --> 00:55:12.585
<b>- Do we have to go?
- Shh, it will be okay.</b>


521
00:55:24.585 --> 00:55:28.543
<b>Toruk Makto and his
family will stay with us.</b>


522
00:55:28.585 --> 00:55:31.710
<b>Treat them as our brothers and
sisters.</b>


523
00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.043
<b>But they do not know the sea.</b>

524
00:55:35.585 --> 00:55:40.543
<b>So, they will be like
babies taking their first breath.</b>


525
00:55:40.585 --> 00:55:45.585
<b>Teach them our ways so that they
do not suffer the shame of being useless.</b>


526
00:55:48.585 --> 00:55:51.543
<b>- What do you say?
- Thank you.</b>


527
00:55:51.585 --> 00:55:52.585
<b>(quietly) Thank you.</b>

528
00:55:53.585 --> 00:55:56.751
<b>My son Ao'nung our daughter
Tsireya will show your children what to do.</b>


529
00:55:57.585 --> 00:55:59.543
<b>- Father, why?
- It has been decided.</b>


530
00:55:59.585 --> 00:56:02.585
<b>Come, I will show you our village.</b>

531
00:56:12.585 --> 00:56:13.585
<b>This way.</b>

532
00:56:17.585 --> 00:56:18.585
<b>Tuk, let's go.</b>

533
00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:20.585
<b>Just up here.</b>

534
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:30.376
<b>This is for you.</b>

535
00:56:31.168 --> 00:56:32.585
<b>Your new home.</b>

536
00:56:33.585 --> 00:56:35.543
<b>Yeah, this will work.</b>

537
00:56:35.585 --> 00:56:36.875
<b>This is great.</b>

538
00:56:36.876 --> 00:56:38.585
<b>It's nice right.</b>

539
00:56:51.168 --> 00:56:52.542
<b>Okay, Sully's fall in.</b>

540
00:56:52.543 --> 00:56:54.126
<b>Remember? Family meeting.</b>

541
00:56:54.168 --> 00:56:56.126
<b>- Come on, take a knee let's go</b>
<b>- Kiri.</b>


542
00:56:56.585 --> 00:56:58.168
<b>What?</b>

543
00:57:00.168 --> 00:57:03.584
<b>I need you kids on your best behavior.</b>

544
00:57:03.585 --> 00:57:05.126
<b>I mean it.</b>

545
00:57:05.168 --> 00:57:10.126
<b>Learn fast, pull your weight,
don't cause trouble, got it?</b>


546
00:57:10.168 --> 00:57:12.168
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

547
00:57:13.168 --> 00:57:17.126
<b>I want to go home.</b>

548
00:57:17.168 --> 00:57:19.126
<b>Oh, Tuk...</b>

549
00:57:19.168 --> 00:57:23.168
<b>Tuk, this is our home now.</b>

550
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:27.043
<b>We're gonna get through this.</b>

551
00:57:28.168 --> 00:57:31.292
<b>We're gonna get through this if
we have each others backs, right?</b>


552
00:57:31.293 --> 00:57:33.167
<b>What does your father always say?</b>

553
00:57:33.168 --> 00:57:36.126
<b>Sully's stick together.</b>

554
00:57:36.168 --> 00:57:40.293
<b>That's right, Sully's stick together.
This time with some feeling.</b>


555
00:57:42.168 --> 00:57:46.168
<b>- Sully's stick together.
- Sully's stick together.</b>


556
00:57:57.168 --> 00:57:58.168
<b>Come on!</b>

557
00:59:35.168 --> 00:59:37.168
<b>Swim together with us.</b>

558
01:00:11.585 --> 01:00:14.085
<b>What's wrong with them?</b>

559
01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:16.126
<b>They are bad divers.</b>

560
01:00:16.168 --> 01:00:17.168
<b>Stop.</b>

561
01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:19.168
<b>They're learning.</b>

562
01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:34.126
<b>- Are you okay?
- You're too fast! Wait for us.</b>


563
01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:35.710
<b>Just breathe.</b>

564
01:00:36.335 --> 01:00:36.918
<b>Breathe.</b>

565
01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:41.126
<b>You are not good divers. You may be
good at swinging through trees.</b>


566
01:00:41.793 --> 01:00:44.626
<b>- Come on, bro.
- We don't speak this finger talk.</b>


567
01:00:45.085 --> 01:00:46.144
<b>We don't know what you're saying.</b>

568
01:00:46.168 --> 01:00:47.584
<b>I will teach you.</b>

569
01:00:47.585 --> 01:00:48.792
<b>Where is Kiri?</b>

570
01:00:48.793 --> 01:00:49.210
<b>Kiri?</b>

571
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:49.501
<b>Who?</b>

572
01:00:49.501 --> 01:00:49.918
<b>Kiri.</b>

573
01:00:49.919 --> 01:00:52.168
<b>- Where is Kiri?
- Did you see her?</b>


574
01:01:03.168 --> 01:01:08.126
<b>Get on the ship, find a seat,
and keep out of the way.</b>


575
01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:11.460
<b>Let's go. Chop Chop.</b>

576
01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:15.126
<b>Whoa, whoa, hold on there hotshot.</b>

577
01:01:15.168 --> 01:01:20.126
<b>Listen up. There is a tracker
built into that mask.</b>


578
01:01:20.168 --> 01:01:22.167
<b>We hit the ground and</b>
<b>you take off.</b>


579
01:01:22.168 --> 01:01:24.126
<b>I'll have you back in 2 minutes.</b>

580
01:01:24.168 --> 01:01:29.126
<b>And I will give you an old-school
ass whooping. Understood?</b>


581
01:01:29.168 --> 01:01:32.126
<b>- Understood?
- Yes, sir.</b>


582
01:01:32.168 --> 01:01:34.418
<b>- We up?
- Teams up.</b>


583
01:01:49.168 --> 01:01:54.126
<b>Listen up. Jake
Sully has gone underground.</b>


584
01:01:54.626 --> 01:01:57.459
<b>Don't matter, wherever
he is, we'll find him.</b>


585
01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.585
<b>And his bat shit crazy wife too.</b>

586
01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:05.126
<b>To do so.
We go Na'vi.</b>


587
01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.126
<b>Full tilt all the way.</b>

588
01:02:07.168 --> 01:02:09.209
<b>That means we eat Na'vi.</b>

589
01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:10.917
<b>We ride Na'vi.</b>

590
01:02:10.918 --> 01:02:13.126
<b>We think Na'vi.</b>

591
01:02:13.418 --> 01:02:18.751
<b>And that starts with
speaking the languiage.</b>


592
01:02:21.168 --> 01:02:23.418
<b>You call that speaking the language?</b>

593
01:02:23.793 --> 01:02:26.335
<b>You sound like a three year old.</b>

594
01:02:28.168 --> 01:02:30.168
<b>Alright, smart guy.</b>

595
01:02:31.168 --> 01:02:35.168
<b>You just went from being our
monkey mascot to official interpreter.</b>


596
01:02:42.168 --> 01:02:47.168
<b>These are Ilu. If you want to
live here, you have to ride.</b>


597
01:02:48.168 --> 01:02:51.168
<b>Make the bond gently.</b>

598
01:02:55.168 --> 01:02:59.168
<b>Feel his breath.
Feel his strength.</b>


599
01:03:00.168 --> 01:03:02.167
<b>Hold here.</b>

600
01:03:02.168 --> 01:03:06.168
<b>- Look at his legs.
- Hold on.</b>


601
01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:27.168
<b>Everything alright, forest boy?</b>

602
01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:43.668
<b>This is a warriors mount. Not easy to
master Perhaps you should start with an ilu.</b>


603
01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.168
<b>No, this one.</b>

604
01:03:48.168 --> 01:03:54.168
<b>Now remember, when you dive
back in, good position, very important.</b>


605
01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.168
<b>I got this.</b>

606
01:04:25.168 --> 01:04:26.168
<b>Yes that's it.</b>

607
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:28.751
<b>Steady.</b>

608
01:05:15.168 --> 01:05:17.168
<b>I love her already.</b>

609
01:05:56.168 --> 01:05:59.168
<b>Breathe in…</b>

610
01:06:01.168 --> 01:06:04.126
<b>And breathe out.</b>

611
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:08.126
<b>Imagine flickering a flame.</b>

612
01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:11.168
<b>You must slow down your heartbeat.</b>

613
01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:15.126
<b>Breathe in.</b>

614
01:06:15.168 --> 01:06:18.167
<b>Breathe from down here.</b>

615
01:06:18.168 --> 01:06:22.168
<b>Breathe out slowly.</b>

616
01:06:23.168 --> 01:06:28.126
<b>Lo'ak, your heartbeat is
fast. Try to focus.</b>


617
01:06:28.168 --> 01:06:30.168
<b>Breathe in…</b>

618
01:06:31.168 --> 01:06:35.168
<b>And breathe out. 
Let your mind go clear.</b>

619
01:06:53.168 --> 01:06:55.168
<b>You are learning to breathe.</b>

620
01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:02.626
<b>Come on, keep up losers!</b>

621
01:07:17.376 --> 01:07:18.626
<b>I got this.</b>

622
01:07:25.085 --> 01:07:26.126
<b>What?</b>

623
01:07:26.293 --> 01:07:30.625
<b>Na'vi kids younger than me do this
with their bare hands.</b>


624
01:07:30.626 --> 01:07:34.626
<b>- Jake Sully do it the hard way?
- What do you think?</b>


625
01:07:38.626 --> 01:07:39.626
<b>What do we do, Cololnel?</b>

626
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:46.626
<b>This is going to be good.</b>

627
01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:50.626
<b>Alright, move up.</b>

628
01:07:57.626 --> 01:07:59.626
<b>It's you and me, cupcake.</b>

629
01:08:12.626 --> 01:08:15.626
<b>Did I mention you're supposed to tie
the mouth shut first?</b>


630
01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:17.626
<b>Thanks a lot, kid.</b>

631
01:08:22.626 --> 01:08:23.626
<b>Move up! Move up!</b>

632
01:08:30.626 --> 01:08:32.626
<b>Can you see them?</b>

633
01:08:54.626 --> 01:08:58.626
<b>Come on, we have to move on.</b>

634
01:09:00.626 --> 01:09:01.626
<b>Let's go.</b>

635
01:09:08.626 --> 01:09:10.626
<b>Yes, that's right!</b>

636
01:09:13.626 --> 01:09:14.960
<b>- That's right, Colonel!</b>
<b>- Get some!</b>


637
01:09:15.626 --> 01:09:18.626
<b>Whose up next.</b>

638
01:09:25.626 --> 01:09:30.626
<b>The way of water has
no beginning and no end.</b>


639
01:09:34.626 --> 01:09:38.626
<b>The sea is around
you and in you.</b>


640
01:09:43.626 --> 01:09:48.626
<b>The sea is your home
before your birth...</b>


641
01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:52.626
<b>and after your death.</b>

642
01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:01.918
<b>Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.</b>


643
01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:07.626
<b>Our breath burns in the
shadows of the deep.</b>


644
01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:14.626
<b>The sea gives and the sea takes.</b>

645
01:10:17.626 --> 01:10:19.626
<b>Water connects all things.</b>

646
01:10:22.626 --> 01:10:24.626
<b>Life to death.</b>

647
01:10:26.626 --> 01:10:29.626
<b>Darkness to light.</b>

648
01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:35.626
<b>- I got it! Tsireya!
- You did it.</b>


649
01:10:51.918 --> 01:10:54.626
<b>This will help you breathe underwater.</b>

650
01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.585
<b>What is she doing?</b>

651
01:11:39.626 --> 01:11:43.626
<b>- I don't know.
- She's just looking at the sand.</b>


652
01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:46.585
<b>What did you say?</b>

653
01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:49.626
<b>Are you some kind of freak?</b>

654
01:11:50.168 --> 01:11:52.626
<b>He asked if you were a freak.</b>

655
01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:56.460
<b>No.</b>

656
01:11:56.626 --> 01:11:59.585
<b>Are you sure? I mean, you
are not even real Na'vi.</b>


657
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.835
<b>Look at these hands.</b>
<b>I mean look at them.</b>


658
01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.376
<b>Hey!</b>

659
01:12:04.377 --> 01:12:06.585
<b>Back off, fish lips.</b>

660
01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:11.625
<b>- Another four-fingered freak.
- Look at his little baby tail.</b>


661
01:12:11.626 --> 01:12:14.625
<b>- Leave us alone!
- He's not normal.</b>


662
01:12:14.626 --> 01:12:18.626
<b>Look at his tail.
It is very cute.</b>


663
01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:22.585
<b>You heard her. 
Leave them alone.</b>

664
01:12:22.626 --> 01:12:25.585
<b>Big brother coming to-</b>

665
01:12:25.626 --> 01:12:29.626
<b>Back off. Now.</b>

666
01:12:34.626 --> 01:12:41.626
<b>It's your choice. And from now on,
I need you to respect my sister.</b>


667
01:12:45.335 --> 01:12:46.626
<b>Let's go.</b>

668
01:12:48.793 --> 01:12:50.585
<b>Bye bye!</b>

669
01:12:50.626 --> 01:12:54.626
<b>Look at them, they are freaks
the whole family.</b>


670
01:12:55.626 --> 01:12:58.626
<b>- Lo'ak...
- I got this, bro.</b>


671
01:13:01.626 --> 01:13:05.585
<b>I know this hand is funny.</b>
<b>Look, I'm a freak.</b>


672
01:13:05.835 --> 01:13:06.835
<b>Alien.</b>

673
01:13:07.626 --> 01:13:12.625
<b>But it can do something cool. Watch,
First I tie it really tight.</b>


674
01:13:12.626 --> 01:13:14.626
<b>And then…</b>

675
01:13:18.626 --> 01:13:22.626
<b>It's called a punch bitch. Don't
ever touch my sister again.</b>


676
01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:35.625
<b>Hold on!</b>

677
01:13:35.626 --> 01:13:37.626
<b>Stop it!</b>

678
01:13:39.626 --> 01:13:41.626
<b>That's too stupid!</b>

679
01:13:44.126 --> 01:13:45.376
<b>Ow, my tail!</b>

680
01:13:46.626 --> 01:13:51.626
<b>My ear! Let it go!
He's got my ear!</b>


681
01:13:56.626 --> 01:14:00.625
<b>- What was the one thing I asked. The one thing.
- Stay out of trouble. Right.</b>


682
01:14:00.626 --> 01:14:04.209
<b>- It was my fault.
- I don't think so, you've gotta stop taking the heat for this knucklehead.</b>


683
01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:06.251
<b>Look dad, Ao'nung was picking on Kiri.</b>

684
01:14:07.168 --> 01:14:08.460
<b>He called her a freak.</b>

685
01:14:11.626 --> 01:14:14.459
<b>- Go apologize to Ao'noung.
- What?</b>


686
01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.626
<b>He is the chiefs son. 
Do you understand?</b>

687
01:14:17.626 --> 01:14:21.626
<b>I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.</b> <b>Just go.</b>


688
01:14:28.626 --> 01:14:31.626
<b>- So what did the other guys look like?
- Worse.</b>


689
01:14:32.626 --> 01:14:34.626
<b>- That's good.
- A lot worse.</b>


690
01:14:35.626 --> 01:14:36.626
<b>Get outta here.</b>

691
01:14:48.626 --> 01:14:50.626
<b>What is wrong?</b>

692
01:14:51.626 --> 01:14:55.751
<b>Nothing. I'm fine.
Why should I not be fine?</b>


693
01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:07.585
<b>Why can't I just be
like everyone else?</b>


694
01:15:07.626 --> 01:15:09.626
<b>Oh, Kiri.</b>

695
01:15:12.626 --> 01:15:15.626
<b>What's tree boy doing here?</b>

696
01:15:18.626 --> 01:15:21.626
<b>Sorry, I hit you, so many times.</b>

697
01:15:28.501 --> 01:15:29.668
<b>We should be friends.</b>

698
01:15:31.626 --> 01:15:37.085
<b>Come hunting with us outside the
reef. It's where the men hunt.</b>


699
01:15:38.626 --> 01:15:42.626
<b>- No way, I'm not allowed.
- I must be asking the wrong brother.</b>


700
01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:45.626
<b>Let's do it.</b>

701
01:15:59.626 --> 01:16:00.626
<b>Come on!</b>

702
01:16:10.626 --> 01:16:12.626
<b>Keep up, forest boy.</b>

703
01:16:16.626 --> 01:16:20.626
<b>Three Rocks Brothers</b>

704
01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:31.626
<b>- You lived.
- That was insane cuz.</b>


705
01:16:32.626 --> 01:16:34.626
<b>This way, I know a good spot.</b>

706
01:16:47.626 --> 01:16:48.626
<b>Call the fish.</b>

707
01:17:04.626 --> 01:17:06.626
<b>What a moron.</b>

708
01:17:27.085 --> 01:17:28.875
<b>Hey, guys!</b>

709
01:17:28.876 --> 01:17:29.876
<b>Hey!</b>

710
01:17:32.626 --> 01:17:34.585
<b>Ao'nung!</b>

711
01:17:34.626 --> 01:17:36.626
<b>Come on, this isn't funny.</b>

712
01:21:23.585 --> 01:21:24.585
<b>Holy shit.</b>

713
01:21:54.585 --> 01:21:56.585
<b>You are a tulkun.</b>

714
01:21:59.043 --> 01:22:01.585
<b>You saved my life. 
Thank you.</b>

715
01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.585
<b>Thank you.</b>

716
01:22:10.585 --> 01:22:13.585
<b>Buddy, I have no idea what you said.</b>

717
01:22:19.585 --> 01:22:21.585
<b>They hurt you, didn't they.</b>

718
01:22:23.585 --> 01:22:26.543
<b>I'll try to pull it out.</b>

719
01:22:26.585 --> 01:22:28.585
<b>Trust me.</b>

720
01:23:02.585 --> 01:23:04.585
<b>Friends?</b>

721
01:23:07.585 --> 01:23:10.585
<b>Yes, we are friends.</b>

722
01:23:14.585 --> 01:23:15.585
<b>Bro!</b>

723
01:24:26.585 --> 01:24:28.585
<b>I am sorry.</b>

724
01:25:07.585 --> 01:25:11.585
<b>What is it baby girl?
Do you miss Spider?</b>


725
01:25:14.585 --> 01:25:18.585
<b>Yes, but that's not it.</b>

726
01:25:20.585 --> 01:25:25.543
<b>Okay. What is it then?</b>

727
01:25:25.585 --> 01:25:29.543
<b>I can feel her, Dad.</b>

728
01:25:29.585 --> 01:25:32.585
<b>- You feel who?
- Eywa.</b>


729
01:25:37.585 --> 01:25:42.584
<b>I can hear her breathing.
I can hear her heartbeat.</b>


730
01:25:42.585 --> 01:25:45.543
<b>She is so close.</b>

731
01:25:45.585 --> 01:25:47.585
<b>She's just there...</b>

732
01:25:49.585 --> 01:25:52.585
<b>like a word about to be spoken.</b>

733
01:25:57.585 --> 01:26:00.585
<b>I know you think I'm crazy.</b>

734
01:26:01.585 --> 01:26:03.585
<b>You're not crazy, honey.</b>

735
01:26:08.585 --> 01:26:10.585
<b>So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?</b>


736
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.585
<b>Mighty.</b>

737
01:26:24.585 --> 01:26:27.585
<b>Tell him what you told me.</b>

738
01:26:32.585 --> 01:26:34.585
<b>Do you like looking at the stars?</b>

739
01:26:37.585 --> 01:26:39.585
<b>My father came from a star.</b>

740
01:26:40.585 --> 01:26:42.585
<b>The one right there.</b>

741
01:26:45.585 --> 01:26:48.585
<b>- Lo'ak!
- I'm in trouble.</b>


742
01:26:51.585 --> 01:26:53.835
<b>Go. I will see you again.</b>

743
01:27:11.585 --> 01:27:15.585
<b>- The boy has been found!
- The Sully boy, we found him.</b>


744
01:27:24.585 --> 01:27:26.584
<b>Let's have a look at you.</b>

745
01:27:26.585 --> 01:27:31.585
<b>He's fine. He's fine. It's
just a few scratches.</b>


746
01:27:33.585 --> 01:27:37.585
<b>I pray for the strength that I will not
rip the eyeballs out of my youngest son.</b>


747
01:27:39.585 --> 01:27:43.585
<b>No. My son knows better than to
take him outside the reef.</b>


748
01:27:45.585 --> 01:27:46.585
<b>The blame is his.</b>

749
01:27:48.585 --> 01:27:49.543
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

750
01:27:49.585 --> 01:27:54.585
<b>No. It's not Ao'nung's
fault. It was my idea.</b>


751
01:27:55.585 --> 01:27:59.585
<b>Ao'nung tried
to talk me out of it.</b>


752
01:28:00.585 --> 01:28:02.126
<b>- Lo'ak.
- I'm sorry.</b>


753
01:28:03.293 --> 01:28:04.335
<b>Come on.</b>

754
01:28:07.585 --> 01:28:09.585
<b>I got this one.</b>

755
01:28:11.585 --> 01:28:15.585
<b>- Is this true?
- Ao'noung, what were you thinking?</b>


756
01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:20.625
<b>Dad you told me make
friends with these kids.</b>


757
01:28:20.626 --> 01:28:21.585
<b>That's all I was trying to do.</b>

758
01:28:21.586 --> 01:28:26.585
<b>I don't want to hear about it. You
have brought shame to this family.</b>


759
01:28:28.585 --> 01:28:32.168
<b>- Can I go now?
- Any more trouble, I'll tie a knot in your tail.</b>


760
01:28:32.376 --> 01:28:36.585
<b>- You read me?
- Yes sir. Lima Charlie.</b>


761
01:28:45.585 --> 01:28:50.543
<b>- Where were you?
- Yeah, what happened to keep an eye on your brother.</b>


762
01:28:50.585 --> 01:28:52.585
<b>I'm sorry sir.</b>

763
01:28:56.585 --> 01:28:58.585
<b>Why did you speak for me?</b>

764
01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:03.585
<b>Because I know what it's like
to be one big disappointment.</b>


765
01:29:05.585 --> 01:29:10.209
<b>Wish I had been there.
The ocean blessed you with a gift brother.</b>


766
01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:15.543
<b>The tulkuns have not returned yet
and anyway no tulkun is ever alone.</b>


767
01:29:15.585 --> 01:29:17.543
<b>This one was.</b>

768
01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:22.543
<b>He had a missing fin.
Like a stump on the left side.</b>


769
01:29:22.585 --> 01:29:25.584
<b>Payakan. It's Payakan.</b>

770
01:29:25.585 --> 01:29:29.543
<b>- Who is Payakan?
- A young bull who went rogue.</b>


771
01:29:29.585 --> 01:29:32.917
<b>He is outcast, alone
and has missing a fin.</b>

772
01:29:32.918 --> 01:29:39.543
<b>- They say he is a killer.
- He killed Na'vi and other Tulkuns.</b>


773
01:29:39.585 --> 01:29:43.585
<b>- Not here, but far to the south.
- No, he's no killer.</b>


774
01:29:44.585 --> 01:29:48.543
<b>- You're lucky to be alive.
- I'm telling you guys, he saved my life.</b>


775
01:29:48.585 --> 01:29:52.543
<b>- He is my friend.
- My baby bro...</b>


776
01:29:52.585 --> 01:29:57.585
<b>The mighty warrior who faced
a killer tulkun and survived.</b>


777
01:29:58.585 --> 01:30:01.543
<b>You guys aren't listening.</b>

778
01:30:01.585 --> 01:30:04.250
<b>- I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back.</b>


779
01:30:04.251 --> 01:30:05.376
<b>You skxawng.</b>

780
01:30:06.835 --> 01:30:07.835
<b>Payakan!</b>

781
01:30:09.835 --> 01:30:10.835
<b>Payakan!</b>

782
01:30:12.835 --> 01:30:14.835
<b>Payakan!</b>

783
01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:24.835
<b>Good to see you.</b>

784
01:30:26.835 --> 01:30:29.835
<b>Why are you outcast?
What happened?</b>


785
01:30:30.835 --> 01:30:33.835
<b>It's too painful.</b>

786
01:30:34.835 --> 01:30:40.835
<b>I trust you. 
You can trust me.</b>

787
01:31:25.835 --> 01:31:27.835
<b>Bro, that's disgusting.</b>

788
01:31:31.835 --> 01:31:33.835
<b>Faster!</b>

789
01:32:09.543 --> 01:32:10.835
<b>We are here.</b>

790
01:32:17.085 --> 01:32:21.210
<b>This is the cove of the ancestors,</b>
<b>our most sacred place.</b>


791
01:32:27.835 --> 01:32:30.835
<b>Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.</b>


792
01:32:43.835 --> 01:32:47.835
<b>This is it. 
This is The Spirit Tree.</b>

793
01:33:53.793 --> 01:33:56.293
<b>My beautiful daughter.</b>

794
01:33:56.835 --> 01:33:57.876
<b>Hi Mom.</b>

795
01:33:58.335 --> 01:34:02.751
<b>I'm so happy to see you.
But you look troubled.</b>


796
01:34:07.168 --> 01:34:09.042
<b>Shhh, Shhh, Shhh.</b>

797
01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:10.418
<b>My sweet girl.</b>

798
01:34:19.335 --> 01:34:24.335
<b>- What is it baby?
- Why am I different?</b>


799
01:34:25.335 --> 01:34:28.501
<b>What does the Great Mother want for me?</b>

800
01:34:31.835 --> 01:34:34.335
<b>Who was my father?</b>

801
01:34:37.335 --> 01:34:40.335
<b>Oh, my god...</b>

802
01:35:03.335 --> 01:35:05.335
<b>- Come on!
- Kiri!</b>


803
01:35:06.335 --> 01:35:08.335
<b>Kiri!</b>

804
01:35:10.335 --> 01:35:14.293
<b>- What's wrong? What is it?
- It was a seizure.</b>


805
01:35:14.335 --> 01:35:17.668
<b>Is she breathing?</b>

806
01:35:20.335 --> 01:35:24.335
<b>- Get her to the village.
- Lets go!</b>


807
01:35:40.335 --> 01:35:44.042
<b>- Good to see you.
- Neteyam, keep them back.</b>


808
01:35:44.043 --> 01:35:46.293
<b>- How is she?
- Still unconscious.</b>


809
01:35:46.335 --> 01:35:50.085
<b>There's no bleed, no fracture.</b>

810
01:35:50.543 --> 01:35:52.335
<b>No signs of Hypoxia.</b>

811
01:35:57.626 --> 01:36:01.667
<b>But there is interictal
activity in the frontal lobe.</b>


812
01:36:01.668 --> 01:36:05.293
<b>She definetly had a seizure.
We can rule out toxins.</b>


813
01:36:06.626 --> 01:36:10.335
<b>- I see that I am not needed here.
- You are Tsahik.</b>


814
01:36:11.335 --> 01:36:16.210
<b>- Remove these things.
- Out! You have done nothing!</b>


815
01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:20.335
<b>- Come on, let's just take a break.
- Hold on I have to take her IV out.</b>


816
01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:22.960
<b>Tuktirey.</b>

817
01:36:30.335 --> 01:36:35.293
<b>She said she could feel
Eywa, she could hear her heartbeat.</b>


818
01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.917
<b>- That is classic frontal lobe epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?</b>


819
01:36:39.918 --> 01:36:44.626
<b>You see visions and experiences religious
ecstasy like the one she described.</b>


820
01:36:52.751 --> 01:36:56.001
<b>Plugging into The Spirit
Tree is some sort of a trigger.</b>


821
01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.293
<b>You definetly can't let
her do that anymore.</b>


822
01:36:59.668 --> 01:37:01.126
<b>What? Ever?</b>

823
01:37:01.668 --> 01:37:06.668
<b>Jake, if she seizes
underwater again, it could kill her.</b>


824
01:37:16.335 --> 01:37:20.335
<b>Kiri, you are awake.</b>

825
01:37:28.335 --> 01:37:32.710
<b>Kiri, my sweet child.
My sweet little girl.</b>


826
01:37:33.626 --> 01:37:36.335
<b>Okay this one: "I see you."</b>

827
01:37:42.085 --> 01:37:43.793
<b>That's what I just said, isn't it?</b>

828
01:37:45.876 --> 01:37:48.334
<b>Not Naati. Ngaati.</b>

829
01:37:48.335 --> 01:37:51.626
<b>Okay, it's going out
through the nose or something.</b>


830
01:37:52.543 --> 01:37:57.376
<b>Boss, one of the patrols picked
up a radar hit.</b> <b>A rogue gunship.</b>


831
01:37:58.585 --> 01:38:01.585
<b>- Where?
- Eastern sea, 2 clicks north.</b>


832
01:38:04.251 --> 01:38:05.335
<b>Hang on.</b>

833
01:38:07.335 --> 01:38:11.293
<b>The signal disappeared
out over the open sea.</b>


834
01:38:11.335 --> 01:38:17.293
<b>But if you project the track,
it hits this island group.</b>


835
01:38:17.335 --> 01:38:21.625
<b>That's hundreds of islands.</b>
<b>That's a big search box.</b>


836
01:38:21.626 --> 01:38:22.917
<b>Lots of villages.</b>

837
01:38:22.918 --> 01:38:27.460
<b>This is our guy. Give me ships and aircraft
I will bring you with his scalp.</b>


838
01:38:39.335 --> 01:38:42.335
<b>- Bogeys, inbound.
- Skipper.</b>


839
01:38:49.335 --> 01:38:53.335
<b>- All stop.
- Yes.</b>


840
01:39:12.251 --> 01:39:13.251
<b>Hey.</b>

841
01:39:13.335 --> 01:39:15.293
<b>Are you Scoresby?</b>

842
01:39:15.335 --> 01:39:18.293
<b>Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?</b>


843
01:39:18.335 --> 01:39:21.293
<b>That would be me.</b>

844
01:39:21.335 --> 01:39:25.293
<b>The target is pretty much
this whole island group.</b>


845
01:39:25.335 --> 01:39:31.168
<b>I've never been up there. You know those
waters Doc. What kind of indigenous we got?</b>


846
01:39:31.418 --> 01:39:35.042
<b>Metkayina mostly. Some Ta'unui,
maybe 50 villages.</b>


847
01:39:35.043 --> 01:39:36.751
<b>Uh you are? Who?</b>

848
01:39:38.043 --> 01:39:41.293
<b>Ian Garvin, marine biologist.</b>

849
01:39:41.335 --> 01:39:45.585
<b>50 villages, 100 villages I don't care
we'll search them all.</b>


850
01:39:46.585 --> 01:39:51.042
<b>I hunt tulkuns. That's what
I'm rigged for. That's all my guys do.</b>


851
01:39:51.043 --> 01:39:52.543
<b>I have quotas to meet..</b>

852
01:39:53.668 --> 01:39:57.335
<b>I'll be nice once, and then I won't.</b>

853
01:40:00.335 --> 01:40:04.293
<b>If you can't get out of
it, get into it.</b>


854
01:40:04.335 --> 01:40:08.335
<b>- All crews at their stations!
- Hey, don't touch.</b>


855
01:40:10.168 --> 01:40:13.043
<b>- Now bring her up, flight speed.
- Flight speed ay.</b>


856
01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:27.543
<b>- What was that?
- What's going on?</b>


857
01:40:30.835 --> 01:40:35.710
<b>The Tulkuns have returned! Everybody, our
brothers and sisters have returned.</b>


858
01:40:45.543 --> 01:40:49.876
<b>In their endless cycle of migration.</b>
<b>The Tulkun had come home.</b>


859
01:40:56.543 --> 01:41:01.543
<b>- Kiri, come on. Come on.
- Tuk, leave me alone.</b>


860
01:41:03.376 --> 01:41:05.543
<b>- What do you want?
- Look!</b>


861
01:41:14.918 --> 01:41:17.501
<b>- Come on.</b>
<b>- Let's go meet them.</b>


862
01:41:18.668 --> 01:41:20.710
<b>Look, It's my spirit sister.</b>

863
01:42:17.668 --> 01:42:20.543
<b>Sister, I see you.</b>

864
01:42:21.251 --> 01:42:23.918
<b>I see you, sister. 
I am happy.</b>

865
01:42:29.918 --> 01:42:33.168
<b>Your son is very beautiful.</b>

866
01:42:33.751 --> 01:42:36.543
<b>Thanks. How is your baby?</b>

867
01:42:37.376 --> 01:42:39.793
<b>My baby is strong.</b>

868
01:42:42.626 --> 01:42:43.834
<b>I met a boy.</b>

869
01:42:43.835 --> 01:42:47.710
<b>It was a time for stories of
their season apart.</b>


870
01:42:48.376 --> 01:42:50.543
<b>Of death and births.</b>

871
01:42:52.668 --> 01:42:55.001
<b>Of old friends and new loves.</b>

872
01:43:11.210 --> 01:43:13.793
<b>TA'UNUI
-VILLAGE</b>

873
01:43:17.543 --> 01:43:19.542
<b>Be calm.</b>

874
01:43:19.543 --> 01:43:23.501
<b>We are looking for weapons,
radios, technical equipment.</b>


875
01:43:23.543 --> 01:43:27.501
<b>Down on your knees!</b>

876
01:43:27.543 --> 01:43:29.543
<b>Shut up!</b>

877
01:43:33.043 --> 01:43:38.668
<b>We know this man resides somewhere
here on the islands.</b>


878
01:43:38.918 --> 01:43:39.918
<b>Here in this village?</b>

879
01:43:39.919 --> 01:43:46.792
<b>We are a totally different clan. The man
in the picture is from the forest.</b>


880
01:43:46.793 --> 01:43:49.875
<b>- What is he saying?
- They never saw him, these are sea people.</b>


881
01:43:49.876 --> 01:43:51.709
<b>Forest people don't come here.</b>

882
01:43:51.710 --> 01:43:53.543
<b>I ain't buying that.</b>

883
01:43:58.376 --> 01:44:02.376
<b>He must search in the forest
if he is to find that man.</b>


884
01:44:05.085 --> 01:44:06.210
<b>They don't know anything.</b>

885
01:44:09.501 --> 01:44:11.043
<b>Shoot that animal.</b>

886
01:44:14.126 --> 01:44:15.585
<b>What the hell are you doing?</b>

887
01:44:24.585 --> 01:44:25.668
<b>Be calm.</b>

888
01:44:26.543 --> 01:44:31.335
<b>Are your ears working now? Now
you have seen what these can do huh.</b>


889
01:44:33.751 --> 01:44:38.043
<b>Jake Sully. 
Toruk Makto!</b>

890
01:44:38.085 --> 01:44:40.043
<b>He already told you he knows nothing.</b>

891
01:44:40.085 --> 01:44:42.085
<b>Put her down.</b>

892
01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:46.209
<b>Stop! Stop!</b>

893
01:44:46.210 --> 01:44:52.043
<b>You make it real clear for him. If he
doesn't give up Sully, we'll kill the Tsahik.</b>


894
01:44:52.085 --> 01:44:57.085
<b>No, I'm not doing that.</b>
<b>- That right?</b> <b>I don't want to be part of this.</b>


895
01:44:58.501 --> 01:45:01.085
<b>These people don't know anything.</b>

896
01:45:07.085 --> 01:45:09.084
<b>Are we really going to kill her?</b>

897
01:45:09.085 --> 01:45:15.085
<b>You must not do that. What you
are doing here is so wrong!</b>


898
01:45:16.918 --> 01:45:19.085
<b>Please.</b>

899
01:45:22.085 --> 01:45:26.043
<b>- Burn the hooches.
- Hey, light them up.</b>


900
01:45:26.085 --> 01:45:28.085
<b>Light em up.</b>

901
01:45:40.835 --> 01:45:42.168
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

902
01:45:42.710 --> 01:45:44.293
<b>I didn't know.</b>

903
01:45:44.626 --> 01:45:46.293
<b>Stop this madness.</b>

904
01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:49.668
<b>- I'm sorry.</b>
<b>- We're out of here.</b>


905
01:45:51.085 --> 01:45:52.835
<b>Don't touch me!</b>

906
01:45:53.335 --> 01:45:54.085
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

907
01:45:54.086 --> 01:45:56.085
<b>Let's go. Saddle up.</b>

908
01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:25.584
<b>- What's wrong?
- Sky people.</b>


909
01:46:25.585 --> 01:46:32.585
<b>They're looking for you JakeSully south.
They have a human boy who speaks Na'vi.</b>


910
01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:39.585
<b>- Did they kill anybody?
- Not yet.</b>


911
01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:46.585
<b>They threaten, but the villagers will
not tell them where you are on my order.</b>


912
01:46:54.585 --> 01:47:00.543
<b>We must hunt this demon.
Trap him, kill him.</b>


913
01:47:00.918 --> 01:47:03.543
<b>We've gotta be smart</b>

914
01:47:03.585 --> 01:47:10.459
<b>If we attack Quaritch, they are gonna know where we are,
and they're gonna come here with everything they got.</b>


915
01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:12.168
<b>Then what is our plan.</b>

916
01:47:13.585 --> 01:47:18.585
<b>We are looking for Toruk
Makto! Has he been here?</b>


917
01:47:22.585 --> 01:47:26.043
<b>- This shit ain't working.
- Nah, they're stone walling us.</b>


918
01:47:26.626 --> 01:47:32.585
<b>If we turn up the heat he's just gonna
keep running. We have to draw him out.</b>


919
01:47:40.835 --> 01:47:45.001
<b>I'm over it. 
I've got quotas to meet.</b>

920
01:47:45.585 --> 01:47:48.585
<b>Do you want to
hunt? Let's hunt.</b>


921
01:47:49.585 --> 01:47:52.543
<b>What? Here? Not here. There's
too many villages.</b>


922
01:47:52.585 --> 01:47:54.251
<b>No no no.</b>

923
01:47:55.585 --> 01:48:00.750
<b>Respectfully sir. You do not understand the
kindred bonds between the Tulkun and the ocean -</b>


924
01:48:00.751 --> 01:48:03.584
<b>Na'vi. It would
be like murdering a member of their family.</b>


925
01:48:03.585 --> 01:48:07.543
<b>If we start hunting here, the
hostiles will come after us.</b>


926
01:48:07.585 --> 01:48:11.585
<b>Exactly. One hostile in particular.</b>

927
01:48:21.501 --> 01:48:24.585
<b>I know how you feel.</b>

928
01:48:25.543 --> 01:48:29.585
<b>I feel all alone too.</b>

929
01:48:30.585 --> 01:48:33.668
<b>Tell me. Why are you outcast?</b>

930
01:50:56.585 --> 01:51:01.585
<b>I am sorry. 
I'm so sorry.</b>

931
01:51:04.585 --> 01:51:07.585
<b>It is okay.</b>

932
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:22.751
<b>You allowed this.</b>

933
01:51:24.376 --> 01:51:27.376
<b>You allowed him to
bond with the outcast.</b>


934
01:51:30.793 --> 01:51:34.793
<b>Tsireya... You
disappoint me, daughter.</b>


935
01:51:36.251 --> 01:51:40.751
<b>And you are the son of a great warrior.
Who has been taught better.</b>


936
01:51:40.793 --> 01:51:43.501
<b>Payakan saved my life sir.
You don't know him.</b>


937
01:51:45.793 --> 01:51:48.751
<b>Sit.</b>

938
01:51:48.793 --> 01:51:50.793
<b>Sit.</b>

939
01:51:52.543 --> 01:51:54.793
<b>Sit down!</b>

940
01:51:57.793 --> 01:52:01.751
<b>Hear my words, boy.</b>

941
01:52:01.793 --> 01:52:06.751
<b>In the days of the first songs, the
tulkuns fought among themselves -</b>


942
01:52:06.793 --> 01:52:09.793
<b>for territory and for revenge.</b>

943
01:52:11.001 --> 01:52:15.792
<b>But they came to believe that
killing, no matter how justified</b>


944
01:52:15.793 --> 01:52:18.876
<b>only brings more killing.</b>

945
01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:23.751
<b>So, killing was forbidden.</b>

946
01:52:23.793 --> 01:52:26.835
<b>This is the Tulkun way.</b>

947
01:52:28.710 --> 01:52:34.168
<b>Payakan is a killer and
so he is outcast.</b>


948
01:52:34.335 --> 01:52:39.625
<b>- I'm sorry sir, but you are wrong.
- Lo'ak, you are speaking to the Olo'eyktan.</b>


949
01:52:39.626 --> 01:52:40.793
<b>That's enough!</b>

950
01:52:45.501 --> 01:52:46.543
<b>I know what I know.</b>

951
01:52:50.293 --> 01:52:51.293
<b>That's enough.</b>

952
01:52:53.251 --> 01:52:54.751
<b>I'll deal with this one.</b>

953
01:53:01.001 --> 01:53:02.376
<b>The storm will pass.</b>

954
01:53:04.126 --> 01:53:07.376
<b>Lo'ak, I saw something today.</b>

955
01:53:08.043 --> 01:53:10.960
<b>I saw a forest boy
chosen by Tulkun.</b>


956
01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:14.210
<b>I am very proud of you.</b>

957
01:53:14.793 --> 01:53:18.751
<b>Payakan didn't kill
those boys. I saw it all.</b>


958
01:53:18.793 --> 01:53:22.792
<b>The demon ship killed his mother right in
front of him, so he gathered the young bulls -</b>


959
01:53:22.793 --> 01:53:27.751
<b>and the reef boys together to attack the
ship, and they were all killed.</b>


960
01:53:27.793 --> 01:53:31.000
<b>But by the Sky People
not by him. He's not a killer.</b>


961
01:53:31.001 --> 01:53:35.751
<b>No, Lo'ak, By the Tulkun way he is,
he bears those deaths.</b>


962
01:53:35.793 --> 01:53:39.667
<b>Will he have to pay for it for the rest of
his life? He knows what he did was wrong.</b>


963
01:53:39.668 --> 01:53:40.793
<b>He would never do it again.</b>

964
01:53:42.793 --> 01:53:46.001
<b>- We must tell my father...
- No. No. I'm in enough trouble with my dad already.</b>


965
01:53:46.418 --> 01:53:50.793
<b>- Your father will understand.
- No. He won't. He doesn't understand anything.</b>


966
01:53:51.126 --> 01:53:55.543
<b>The whole clan hates me. Demon
blood, alien. That's all they see.</b>


967
01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:03.793
<b>I see you.</b>

968
01:54:08.793 --> 01:54:11.793
<b>You are brother of Tulkun.</b>

969
01:54:13.126 --> 01:54:14.793
<b>You are one of us now.</b>

970
01:54:32.376 --> 01:54:36.292
<b>- You got my mother?
- Mother and the calf, strong signal, range 4000.</b>


971
01:54:36.293 --> 01:54:40.293
<b>- Bring it down in the hull.
- Coming down on it.</b>


972
01:55:03.043 --> 01:55:06.459
<b>Sub teams, two minutes!</b>
<b>Let's do this. Let's get in there.</b>


973
01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:07.751
<b>Hatches closed.</b>

974
01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:10.542
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>Hustle! Hustle!</b>


975
01:55:10.543 --> 01:55:14.418
<b>Crews to their boats!

976
01:55:15.085 --> 01:55:18.835
<b>Boat crew. Get ready.</b>

977
01:55:24.543 --> 01:55:26.793
<b>All boats in!</b>

978
01:55:30.793 --> 01:55:32.793
<b>Go!</b>

979
01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:44.793
<b>We're rolling.</b>

980
01:56:10.793 --> 01:56:14.793
<b>Standby, depth charges in.
Fire! Fire! Fire!</b>


981
01:56:36.793 --> 01:56:38.710
<b>What's that? 
What are they doing?</b>

982
01:56:39.210 --> 01:56:43.751
<b>There are echolocation sensors,
with which they navigate.</b>


983
01:56:43.793 --> 01:56:46.793
<b>They keep them afloat
so they don't go deaf.</b>


984
01:56:47.793 --> 01:56:51.793
<b>Picadors, get in there!</b>

985
01:57:07.876 --> 01:57:11.793
<b>They're gonna cut the cow from the
rest of the pod using the sound cannon.</b>


986
01:57:12.293 --> 01:57:17.751
<b>They target the mother because the calf
swims slowly and she won't leave the calf.</b>


987
01:57:17.793 --> 01:57:21.751
<b>- Do they ever fight back?
- No, never seen 'em lift a fin.</b>


988
01:57:22.251 --> 01:57:26.918
<b>Tough bastards to kill
though. Submarine teams, go!</b>


989
01:57:39.335 --> 01:57:43.417
<b>- There we have the lady.
- Target in sight. Harpoons ready.</b>


990
01:57:43.418 --> 01:57:44.501
<b>Here we go baby.</b>

991
01:57:46.126 --> 01:57:50.126
<b>So we go in from below, where
there's gaps in the armor.</b>


992
01:57:53.793 --> 01:57:57.793
<b>- Okay, that's it now.
- Get me really close.</b>


993
01:58:01.793 --> 01:58:04.751
<b>- Hold it steady.
- Arm one.</b>


994
01:58:04.793 --> 01:58:07.793
<b>- Armed.
- And rolling,</b>


995
01:58:21.793 --> 01:58:23.960
<b>- Good strike.
- Arm two.</b>


996
01:58:25.793 --> 01:58:30.793
<b>- Booyah!
- 3-6, you owe us a beer.</b>


997
01:58:34.418 --> 01:58:39.751
<b>The bags slow her down and pull
her up towards the surface.</b>


998
01:58:39.793 --> 01:58:44.792
<b>Bring me closer! Very
close. 30 meters.</b>


999
01:58:44.793 --> 01:58:46.793
<b>Explosive tarpoon</b>

1000
01:58:47.793 --> 01:58:50.751
<b>10 meters. Get me
all the way in there.</b>


1001
01:58:50.793 --> 01:58:55.793
<b>Keep the boat
steady! Wait, wait.</b>


1002
01:59:05.168 --> 01:59:06.960
<b>Hold on to your ponytail, Colonel.</b>

1003
01:59:17.793 --> 01:59:20.793
<b>- Full power back!
- Yes.</b>


1004
01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:29.793
<b>Hold her!</b>

1005
01:59:32.793 --> 01:59:39.793
<b>She takes an explosive harpoon to the
chest, but she keeps running. Beautiful.</b>


1006
02:00:53.793 --> 02:00:58.792
<b>We can only get to the gland from below,
so we drill up through the palate -</b>


1007
02:00:58.793 --> 02:01:01.793
<b>and into the brain.</b>

1008
02:01:05.543 --> 02:01:09.210
<b>These are highly intelligent beings.
Probably smarter than us.</b>


1009
02:01:09.543 --> 02:01:12.751
<b>- Not smarter than me.
- Then the bar is set low.</b>


1010
02:01:12.793 --> 02:01:15.751
<b>I'm the one with the harpoon.</b>

1011
02:01:15.793 --> 02:01:16.793
<b>And yes.</b>

1012
02:01:27.793 --> 02:01:32.751
<b>- How do you know they are smarter than us?
- They have more neurons, more pathways.</b>


1013
02:01:32.793 --> 02:01:36.793
<b>Not only are they smarter,
but also deeply emotional.</b>


1014
02:01:37.793 --> 02:01:39.793
<b>More spiritual.</b>

1015
02:01:42.793 --> 02:01:46.751
<b>The area here corresponds
to our emotional center, -</b>


1016
02:01:46.793 --> 02:01:49.793
<b>but is proportionally
much larger.</b>


1017
02:01:50.793 --> 02:01:54.751
<b>They have music,
philosophy, mathematics -</b>


1018
02:01:54.793 --> 02:01:57.751
<b>and a complex language.</b>

1019
02:01:57.793 --> 02:02:02.793
<b>- Okay, here we go.
- Show me the money.</b>


1020
02:02:06.793 --> 02:02:12.793
<b>- So that's what this is all about?
- That's it. Amrita.</b>


1021
02:02:14.793 --> 02:02:19.959
<b>Bad luck for the big guys.</b> <b>This stuff
just happens to stop human aging.</b>


1022
02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:22.251
<b>Like stops it</b>

1023
02:02:24.793 --> 02:02:30.751
<b>Ounce for ounce, the single most
valuable substance known to man.</b>


1024
02:02:30.793 --> 02:02:35.210
<b>This little vial here is worth
like 80 million.</b>


1025
02:02:36.376 --> 02:02:38.751
<b>Think fast!</b>

1026
02:02:38.793 --> 02:02:41.792
<b>Do not do that.
It's never funny.</b>


1027
02:02:41.793 --> 02:02:45.793
<b>Amrita is what's paying for everything
here on Pandora now.</b>


1028
02:02:46.793 --> 02:02:51.251
<b>- Even your research, Dr. G.
- That's why I drink.</b>


1029
02:02:53.418 --> 02:02:57.793
<b>That's all you take?
You just waste the rest?</b>


1030
02:02:58.793 --> 02:03:02.751
<b>Drop the bags.</b>
<b>Let's sink her.</b>


1031
02:03:02.793 --> 02:03:06.793
<b>No, leave the bags alone.
I want them to know it was us.</b>


1032
02:03:07.793 --> 02:03:10.376
<b>I charge extra for being used as bait.</b>

1033
02:03:45.793 --> 02:03:48.793
<b>Her name is Ro'a.</b>

1034
02:03:49.793 --> 02:03:52.793
<b>She was my spirit sister.</b>

1035
02:03:54.918 --> 02:03:57.793
<b>She was the composer of songs.</b>

1036
02:03:58.793 --> 02:04:01.876
<b>Much revened, we would sing together.</b>

1037
02:04:02.793 --> 02:04:08.793
<b>She waited many breeding cycles to have
this calf. The clan was so happy for her.</b>


1038
02:04:12.501 --> 02:04:14.335
<b>What's is this, Tonowari?</b>

1039
02:04:16.793 --> 02:04:18.960
<b>What is this?!</b>

1040
02:04:38.376 --> 02:04:44.376
<b>My spirit sister and her baby have
been murdered by the sky people.</b>


1041
02:04:45.376 --> 02:04:47.710
<b>The war has come to us.</b>

1042
02:04:48.251 --> 02:04:51.375
<b>We knew about this
hunting of our tulkun people-</b>


1043
02:04:51.376 --> 02:04:54.750
<b>but it was over the horizon far away.</b>

1044
02:04:54.751 --> 02:04:56.585
<b>Now it is here!</b>

1045
02:05:00.376 --> 02:05:03.792
<b>You have to understand
how the sky people think.</b>


1046
02:05:03.793 --> 02:05:05.835
<b>They don't care about the great balance.</b>

1047
02:05:07.376 --> 02:05:09.335
<b>Now listen to him.</b>

1048
02:05:09.376 --> 02:05:11.709
<b>The Sky People are not gonna stop.
This is only the beginning.</b>


1049
02:05:11.710 --> 02:05:14.418
<b>You've got to tell your Tulkuns to leave.</b>

1050
02:05:15.085 --> 02:05:17.001
<b>You gotta tell them to go far away!</b>

1051
02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:19.376
<b>Leave?</b>

1052
02:05:19.876 --> 02:05:24.042
<b>You live among us, and
you learned nothing.</b>


1053
02:05:24.043 --> 02:05:27.335
<b>We will fight to protect</b>
<b>our brothers and sisters!</b>


1054
02:05:27.376 --> 02:05:29.376
<b>No no no.</b>

1055
02:05:30.376 --> 02:05:32.668
<b>If you attack, if you fight.</b>

1056
02:05:33.168 --> 02:05:35.125
<b>Then they will destroy you.</b>

1057
02:05:35.126 --> 02:05:37.376
<b>They will destroy
everything that you love.</b>


1058
02:05:38.085 --> 02:05:41.335
<b>Hear my words! 
Hear my words!</b>

1059
02:05:41.376 --> 02:05:44.335
<b>Stay calm.</b>

1060
02:05:44.376 --> 02:05:48.376
<b>Now listen to my father.</b>
<b>-Damn it.</b> <b>He speaks the truth.</b>


1061
02:05:57.376 --> 02:06:00.375
<b>Tell the tulkuns, -</b>

1062
02:06:00.376 --> 02:06:03.876
<b>that if they are hit by one of
these, they are marked for death.</b>


1063
02:06:06.710 --> 02:06:09.835
<b>Call for me and I'll silence it.</b>

1064
02:06:11.376 --> 02:06:15.126
<b>Saving their lives, that's
all that matters, right?</b>


1065
02:06:18.001 --> 02:06:20.376
<b>Saving your family.</b>

1066
02:06:32.376 --> 02:06:34.376
<b>Tell the Tulkun.</b>

1067
02:06:35.376 --> 02:06:37.376
<b>Go. Go.</b>

1068
02:06:41.376 --> 02:06:43.251
<b>We must fight.</b>

1069
02:06:44.168 --> 02:06:47.626
<b>MaJake... I will not stand and do nothing.</b>

1070
02:06:48.376 --> 02:06:54.376
<b>It's a trap, they want us to hit back. They
aren't hunting Tulkuns. They are hunting us.</b>


1071
02:07:09.126 --> 02:07:12.376
<b>- You're not going anywhere, little brother.
- I have to warn Payakan.</b>


1072
02:07:13.376 --> 02:07:16.335
<b>No. You've got to keep
your skxawng ass here.</b>


1073
02:07:16.376 --> 02:07:19.335
<b>He is outcast. There's no

<b>Bro, why do you always have to make</b>
<b>things so hard.</b>


1075
02:07:25.376 --> 02:07:31.626
<b>No, you mean why can't I be perfect son

1076
02:07:32.668 --> 02:07:36.335
<b>Well I'm not you, okay?</b>

1077
02:07:36.376 --> 02:07:40.376
<b>I'm not you. He's

No, I'm your brother.</b>

1091
02:08:50.376 --> 02:08:52.334
<b>Shit!</b>

1092

02:36:49.293 --> 02:36:51.501
<b>- Stay with him.
- No!</b>


1326
02:36:52.501 --> 02:36:54.501
<b>Be careful, guys.</b>

1327
02:37:15.501 --> 02:37:16.501
<b>Go.</b>

1328
02:37:24.501 --> 02:37:26.542
<b>- Where are they?
- The middle deck.</b>


1329
02:37:26.543 --> 02:37:31.501
<b>There is like a pool in the center.
They are at the fort railing.</b>


1330
02:37:33.501 --> 02:37:35.501
<b>No, stay here.</b>

1331
02:37:37.835 --> 02:37:42.501
<b>Talk to me, Corporal. The ship is sinking
and your girls are going down with it.</b>


1332
02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:48.501
<b>Your son didn't have to
die. It was your own fault.</b>


1333
02:37:54.501 --> 02:37:59.460
<b>You thought you could protect
your family, but you can't.</b>


1334
02:38:00.335 --> 02:38:01.960
<b>Only one way to keep em safe.</b>

1335
02:38:05.710 --> 02:38:08.918
<b>So let's get this over with
before you lose another kid.</b>


1336
02:38:20.501 --> 02:38:22.501
<b>Get down!</b>

1337
02:39:04.626 --> 02:39:06.460
<b>- Who is affected?
- Zdinarsik, copy?</b>


1338
02:39:06.501 --> 02:39:07.501
<b>Clear.</b>

1339
02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:10.501
<b>Prague, are you there?</b>

1340
02:39:12.043 --> 02:39:13.460
<b>Look up!</b>

1341
02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:23.501
<b>Forward!</b>

1342
02:39:25.501 --> 02:39:26.501
<b>To the left!</b>

1343
02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:28.750
<b>To the right. 
Surround her.</b>

1344
02:39:28.751 --> 02:39:29.918
<b>Who's got eyes.</b>

1345
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:16.710
<b>MaJake!</b>

1346
02:40:22.501 --> 02:40:23.501
<b>It's mother!</b>

1347
02:40:30.501 --> 02:40:33.501
<b>That's right.</b>
<b>They are coming for you.</b>


1348
02:41:24.501 --> 02:41:25.876
<b>Dad!</b>

1349
02:41:29.335 --> 02:41:32.460
<b>- Where is your sister?
- That way.</b>


1350
02:41:33.210 --> 02:41:34.585
<b>Stay behind me.</b>

1351
02:41:39.501 --> 02:41:40.501
<b>Kiri!</b>

1352
02:41:41.501 --> 02:41:43.126
<b>Running out of time here, Corporal.</b>

1353
02:41:45.001 --> 02:41:48.085
<b>You already lost one kid today.</b>
<b>You really want to lose another?</b>


1354
02:41:48.501 --> 02:41:50.293
<b>Do not test me!</b>

1355
02:41:52.043 --> 02:41:53.710
<b>Just kill him, dad!</b>

1356
02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:55.460
<b>Kiri!</b>

1357
02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:59.501
<b>- Put down your weapons.
- Don't do that!</b>


1358
02:42:02.001 --> 02:42:03.001
<b>Kick them away.</b>

1359
02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:06.460
<b>Do it!</b>

1360
02:42:09.251 --> 02:42:10.251
<b>No...</b>

1361
02:42:11.835 --> 02:42:15.000
<b>- Cuff yourself.
- No. No. Don't hurt her okay? Don't</b>


1362
02:42:15.001 --> 02:42:18.918
<b>Stay there! Don't
come one step closer.</b>


1363
02:42:19.710 --> 02:42:23.460
<b>- Handcuffs on!
- You son of a bitch.</b>


1364
02:42:23.710 --> 02:42:25.501
<b>Please, don't hurt her.</b>

1365
02:42:28.501 --> 02:42:31.501
<b>Release, or I cut.</b>

1366
02:42:34.501 --> 02:42:36.251
<b>What, you think I care about some kid?</b>

1367
02:42:37.668 --> 02:42:41.460
<b>He is not mine. We are
not even the same species.</b>


1368
02:42:42.626 --> 02:42:46.460
<b>Please don't, don't hurt
her. Let her go.</b>


1369
02:42:47.168 --> 02:42:50.460
<b>Please, listen to me. 
Let her go.</b>

1370
02:42:50.876 --> 02:42:55.501
<b>- Mom, don't kill him.
- A son for a son.</b>


1371
02:42:57.835 --> 02:42:58.918
<b>Please, don't hurt her.</b>

1372
02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:05.501
<b>- I cut.
- Now just let her go.</b>


1373
02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:08.918
<b>No!</b>

1374
02:43:17.501 --> 02:43:19.501
<b>Kiri, Kiri...</b>

1375
02:43:26.501 --> 02:43:30.460
<b>- Spider!
- Get them out of here.</b>


1376
02:43:30.501 --> 02:43:34.501
<b>- Come with me.
- I owe you a death.</b>


1377
02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:41.460
<b>Mom, come on. Mother!</b>

1378
02:43:41.501 --> 02:43:48.210
<b>You're not leaving, are you,
Jake? You know I never give up.</b>


1379
02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:52.501
<b>I will come and kill
your whole family.</b>


1380
02:43:53.918 --> 02:43:54.918
<b>Dad!</b>

1381
02:43:56.668 --> 02:43:57.668
<b>Then let's get it done.</b>

1382
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:09.710
<b>Jake!</b>

1383
02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:16.960
<b>- The fire is coming!
- Back to the ship!</b>


1384
02:44:20.376 --> 02:44:22.626
<b>Stay close to me.</b>

1385
02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:25.960
<b>Tuk!</b>

1386
02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:28.960
<b>Mother, take my hand!</b>

1387
02:44:32.293 --> 02:44:33.751
<b>Mom!</b>

1388
02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:36.960
<b>Come on, Kiri, we have
to get out of here.</b>


1389
02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:42.918
<b>Climb up!</b>

1390
02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:45.960
<b>Come on, Kiri. Go.</b>

1391
02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:49.960
<b>Swim! Climb up, Tuk!</b>

1392
02:44:57.918 --> 02:44:58.918
<b>Mom.</b>

1393
02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:01.960
<b>- Mom!
- Go, go, go!</b>


1394
02:45:09.710 --> 02:45:10.710
<b>Keep climbing, go.</b>

1395
02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:16.210
<b>I got you.</b>

1396
02:45:18.626 --> 02:45:19.626
<b>Give me your hand!</b>

1397
02:45:22.918 --> 02:45:23.918
<b>Open it up!</b>

1398
02:45:32.376 --> 02:45:34.668
<b>- Open it up!
- Back, back!</b>


1399
02:45:35.043 --> 02:45:36.043
<b>Come on!</b>

1400
02:45:37.751 --> 02:45:38.751
<b>Tuk!</b>

1401

<b>Up! Come on.</b>

<b>Climb! Get up!</b>

1403
02:46:01.918 --> 02:46:02.918
<b>We're rolling over!</b>

1404
02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:19.918
<b>Kiri, keep going.</b>

1405
02:46:23.918 --> 02:46:25.126
<b>This way!</b>

1406
02:46:30.918 --> 02:46:32.918
<b>Open it up!</b>

1407
02:46:34.918 --> 02:46:35.918
<b>Mom!</b>

1408
02:46:38.918 --> 02:46:39.960
<b>Come on!</b>

1409
02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:50.960
<b>Further, Tuk.</b>

1410
02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:53.960
<b>We can't get out!</b>

1411
02:46:55.918 --> 02:46:58.960
<b>- We'll stay together, okay?
- Yes.</b>


1412
02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:30.960
<b>Oh Great Mother help us!</b>

1413
02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:14.960
<b>Kiri!</b>

1414
02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:39.917
<b>- Bro.
- Mom and dad are down there.</b>


1415
02:48:39.918 --> 02:48:42.960
<b>- Grab on.
- I'm ready.</b>


1416
02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:11.251
<b>Okay.</b>

1417
02:49:38.918 --> 02:49:39.960
<b>Jake!</b>

1418
02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:17.960
<b>Dad?</b>

1419
02:50:22.793 --> 02:50:23.793
<b>Fuck.</b>

1420
02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:39.918
<b>Come on, you son of a bitch.</b>

1421
02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:42.918
<b>- Breathe, Dad.
- Neteyam?</b>


1422
02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:44.918
<b>No, it's Lo'ak.</b>

1423
02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:48.918
<b>- Oh, Lo'ak...
- Sorry.</b>


1424
02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:53.960
<b>- Neteyam's death is my fault.
- Just focus on getting out.</b>


1425
02:51:12.918 --> 02:51:15.960
<b>The air pocket disappears. We
have to go out. Come on, Dad.</b>


1426
02:51:24.126 --> 02:51:28.001
<b>- You know your way out.
- Yes, but Dad it's gonna be a long breath hold.</b>


1427
02:51:28.918 --> 02:51:33.918
<b>I can't make it. But
you can. Hurry out.</b>


1428
02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:37.918
<b>I can't lose you too, Dad.</b>

1429
02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:42.960
<b>Mom, I'm scared.</b>

1430
02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:48.960
<b>It will be OK. Stick
with me. Stick to mom.</b>


1431
02:51:52.210 --> 02:51:53.210
<b>It's okay.</b>

1432
02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:13.918
<b>You just need to calm your
heart and be completely calm.</b>


1433
02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:16.960
<b>Breathe from down here.</b>

1434
02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:34.960
<b>The way of water has
no beginning and no end.</b>


1435
02:52:35.960 --> 02:52:39.918
<b>The sea is around
you and in you.</b>


1436
02:52:39.960 --> 02:52:43.918
<b>The sea is your home before
your birth and after your death.</b>


1437
02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:52.918
<b>The sea gives and the sea takes.</b>

1438
02:52:52.960 --> 02:52:54.960
<b>Water connects all things.</b>

1439
02:52:57.251 --> 02:52:58.501
<b>Life to death.</b>

1440
02:53:00.751 --> 02:53:02.960
<b>Darkness to light.</b>

1441
02:53:25.960 --> 02:53:27.918
<b>- Hi.
- Kiri!</b>


1442
02:53:28.335 --> 02:53:33.918
<b>It'll be fine, little
sister. Mom, I'm gonna give this to you.</b>


1443
02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:39.918
<b>It will help you.</b>

1444
02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:42.918
<b>Dad, you can do this.</b>

1445
02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:46.501
<b>Trust me. Calm your heart.</b>

1446
02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:49.960
<b>Deep breaths.</b>

1447
02:53:53.543 --> 02:53:54.960
<b>Last breath.</b>

1448
02:53:59.668 --> 02:54:00.710
<b>Follow me.</b>

1449
02:55:16.918 --> 02:55:20.210
<b>Hang on. Just breathe.</b>

1450
02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:25.960
<b>Thank you.</b>

1451
02:55:35.168 --> 02:55:37.460
<b>I see you, my son.</b>

1452
02:55:40.376 --> 02:55:41.918
<b>MaJake!</b>

1453
02:55:42.501 --> 02:55:45.335
<b>Dad! Dad!</b>

1454
02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:48.918
<b>Come. Come here.</b>

1455
02:55:49.126 --> 02:55:51.585
<b>- Tu k!

1456
02:55:57.293 --> 02:55:58.293
<b>Brother.</b>

1457

<b>Sully's stick together.</b>

1458
02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:13.710
<b>That was our greatest weakness -</b>

1459
02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:16.543
<b>and our great strength.</b>

1460
02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:21.960
<b>Thank you, Great Mother. Thanks.</b>

1461
02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:02.293
<b>Let's move out.</b>

1462
02:57:08.876 --> 02:57:09.960
<b>My son..</b>

1463
02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:12.960
<b>Come with me.</b>

1464
02:57:17.918 --> 02:57:18.960
<b>Spider!</b>

1465
02:57:53.043 --> 02:57:54.085
<b>Monkey boy!</b>

1466
02:57:58.543 --> 02:57:59.710
<b>Spider.</b>

1467
02:58:07.085 --> 02:58:09.085
<b>- Are you all right?
- Yes.</b>


1468
02:58:12.376 --> 02:58:13.710
<b>Come here.</b>

1469
02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:18.835
<b>A son for a son.</b>

1470
02:58:35.085 --> 02:58:38.085
<b>Every song chord
must have a last bead.</b>


1471
02:59:02.793 --> 02:59:07.376
<b>A father protects. It's
what gives him meaning.</b>


1472
02:59:35.793 --> 02:59:38.418
<b>The people say that all
energy is only borrowed.</b>


1473
02:59:41.085 --> 02:59:43.626
<b>One day you have
to give it back.</b>


1474
02:59:56.085 --> 03:00:00.668
<b>Eywa holds all her children in her heart.</b>

1475
03:00:02.168 --> 03:00:03.418
<b>Nothing is ever lost.</b>

<b>Neteyam!</b>

1477
03:00:29.085 --> 03:00:33.043
<b>My family and I are
leaving tomorrow.</b>


1478
03:00:33.085 --> 03:00:36.043
<b>Far away from here.</b>

1479
03:00:36.085 --> 03:00:42.085
<b>Your son lies with our ancestors.
You, are metkayinas now.</b>


1480
03:00:47.085 --> 03:00:50.085
<b>And there it was.</b>

1481
03:00:51.043 --> 03:00:53.085
<b>We are sea people now.</b>

1482
03:00:55.085 --> 03:00:58.085
<b>This is our home.</b>

1483
03:01:57.835 --> 03:02:01.043
<b>Dad! Look what I caught!</b>

1484
03:02:01.085 --> 03:02:04.085
<b>Wow, that's a big crab.</b>

1485
03:02:05.168 --> 03:02:11.043
<b>It was over there by the
rocks, just like you said.</b>


1486
03:02:15.043 --> 03:02:19.085
<b>What's the matter, dad?
Why are you crying?</b>


1487
03:02:20.085 --> 03:02:23.085
<b>I'm just happy to see you.</b>

1488
03:02:25.085 --> 03:02:26.793
<b>I'm happy to see you too.</b>

1489
03:02:29.085 --> 03:02:31.085
<b>You try.</b>

1490
03:02:33.085 --> 03:02:34.085
<b>Okay.</b>

1491
03:02:36.043 --> 03:02:39.085
<b>- Have you left me any?
- Maybe.</b>


1492
03:02:45.043 --> 03:02:46.085
<b>Yeah, check that out!</b>

1493
03:02:54.085 --> 03:02:59.043
<b>I see now. I can't save
my family by running.</b>


1494
03:02:59.085 --> 03:03:04.043
<b>This is our home, 
This is our fortress.</b>
