00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.568
<i>30 minutes from now,</i>

183
00:15:56.843 --> 00:15:59.057
<i>You'll go to Incheon Grand Park parking lot.</i>

184
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.956
<i>Open the door and leave.</i>

185
00:16:01.178 --> 00:16:02.713
No, I...

186
00:17:02.077 --> 00:17:03.432
Are you going to arrest him now?

187
00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:05.317
Wait a minute.

188
00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:11.201
Catch him!

189
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.534
Catch him!

190
00:17:15.978 --> 00:17:16.924
What's going on?

191
00:17:20.296 --> 00:17:21.337
Don't move, you son of bitch.

192
00:17:21.346 --> 00:17:22.165
Who are you?

193
00:17:22.181 --> 00:17:23.395
I said I'm not.

194
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.022
I just saw the car door open

195
00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:26.384
and I wanted to see what was in there.

196
00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:28.261
You son of a bitch, aren't
you going tell me the truth

197
00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:34.311
I checked his record.

198
00:17:34.383 --> 00:17:35.818
He's a car thief.

199
00:17:36.234 --> 00:17:38.678
His name is Kim Ki-nam
and has 7 previous burglaries.

200
00:17:38.945 --> 00:17:40.206
He was released from prison not long ago.

201
00:17:40.214 --> 00:17:42.007
I checked his house
and everyone around him.

202
00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:42.970
I didn't find anything.

203
00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:44.260
There's nothing suspicious
about his phone call log too.

204
00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.616
You stupid cops.

205
00:17:56.262 --> 00:17:59.334
His aim may not have been
the money in the first place.

206
00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:00.933
I have investigated the
surrounding situation of this family.

207
00:18:00.973 --> 00:18:02.553
They don't have anyone
who has a grudge on them.

208
00:18:03.194 --> 00:18:06.813
It's neither money nor resentment.

209
00:18:20.095 --> 00:18:21.694
Are you feeling a little better now?

210
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.325
How's my Ah-jin?

211
00:18:24.355 --> 00:18:26.835
Well... we're still looking
for her with all our might.

212
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:27.931
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:15.762 --> 00:19:18.460
Your child doesn't seem to be feeling well.

214
00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:21.219
It's just...

215
00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:24.433
she's a little weak.

216
00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:30.858
Do you have a kid, too?

217
00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:34.619
My child goes to the same
elementary school as Ah-jin.

218
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:36.194
He's a boy, second grader.

219
00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:40.099
If you keep working outside like this...

220
00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:43.019
your child will be lonely, right?

221
00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:46.187
He's a boy, so he won't.
He's brave.

222
00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:48.292
Sometimes he's very reliable.

223
00:19:50.085 --> 00:19:51.686
He's very sensible too.

224
00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:54.573
Officer.

225
00:19:57.216 --> 00:19:58.927
If your child

226
00:20:01.512 --> 00:20:03.968
is the same situation as
what happened to my child,

227
00:20:05.796 --> 00:20:07.132
what will you do?

228
00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:10.888
What if your child...

229
00:20:14.599 --> 00:20:16.443
come back dead,

230
00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:20.681
What will you do?

231
00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:36.417
I'll find the kidnapper first.

232
00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:40.510
And...

233
00:20:46.174 --> 00:20:47.174
kill him.

234
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.886
After all, I'm his mother.

235
00:20:55.165 --> 00:20:57.831
If my son is gone, my life will be over.

236
00:21:00.023 --> 00:21:01.063
You're right.

237
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.513
I think I'll do the same thing you will do.

238
00:21:28.295 --> 00:21:29.295
Mom?

239
00:21:32.577 --> 00:21:34.303
(Kidnapping case of Jeong Dahyun)

240
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:47.969
Hello, Jeong Dahyun.

241
00:21:48.528 --> 00:21:50.289
What time is it? Why don't go to bed yet?

242
00:21:50.314 --> 00:21:51.446
Don't you deserve a beating?

243
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.700
Hello?

244
00:21:55.261 --> 00:21:56.261
Hello?

245
00:21:58.694 --> 00:21:59.694
Mom?

246
00:21:59.996 --> 00:22:01.454
<i>This is Yoon So-Eun, right?</i>

247
00:22:02.035 --> 00:22:04.183
<i>The one who replaced Ah-jin's mother.</i>

248
00:22:04.693 --> 00:22:05.693
What?

249
00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:07.679
<i>Dahyun is in our hands.</i>

250
00:22:08.775 --> 00:22:10.817
<i>If you will just do me a favor,
everything will be fine.</i>

251
00:22:11.425 --> 00:22:13.278
<i>The 300 million won for Ah-jin.</i>

252
00:22:13.302 --> 00:22:15.655
<i>You can just transfer it to me directly.</i>

253
00:22:17.849 --> 00:22:21.026
- <i>You better not to tell your other police colleagues.</i>
- This is..

254
00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:22.930
<i>If you act carelessly</i>

255
00:22:22.943 --> 00:22:23.965
Excuse me, excuse me...

256
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.351
- Hello?
- <i>We can't guarantee Dahyun's life.</i>

257
00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:27.733
That...

258
00:22:28.174 --> 00:22:31.306
- No...
- <i>Because what we value more is Lee Ah-jin's life.</i>

259
00:22:31.554 --> 00:22:34.264
<i>Jeong Dahyun is nothing to us but consumables.</i>

260
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280
No, wait...

261
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:39.228
Excuse me, who.. Wh-who are you?

262
00:22:39.245 --> 00:22:45.109
<i>Even if you betray us, we'll find
someone else to give us the money.</i>

263
00:22:53.993 --> 00:22:54.993
Team leader.

264
00:22:55.008 --> 00:22:56.008
Oh, why?

265
00:22:56.189 --> 00:23:00.162
My... my child has a high fever.

266
00:23:00.474 --> 00:23:02.833
He was in the emergency room,
I'll be back right away.

267
00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:04.696
No, you can't. You know the situation.

268
00:23:04.971 --> 00:23:06.053
I'll be back right away.

269
00:23:06.745 --> 00:23:09.109
My child seems to have a severe fever.

270
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:12.520
Well, try to get back as soon as possible.

271
00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:18.400
Please pick up the phone.

272
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.700
Mom, please.

273
00:23:24.712 --> 00:23:25.752
Ah, really...

274
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.940
Dahyun.

275
00:23:47.401 --> 00:23:48.401
Dahyun.

276
00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:49.847
Mom, where did Dahyun went?

277
00:23:50.251 --> 00:23:51.251
Dahyun.

278
00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:53.809
I can't find Dahyun!

279
00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:57.418
You can't even look at a child!
Didn't you notice he's gone?

280
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:00.361
Dahyun.

281
00:24:00.887 --> 00:24:02.951
Dahyun, where are you?

282
00:24:09.389 --> 00:24:10.389
Mom.

283
00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:14.204
Listen to what I have to say from now on.

284
00:24:16.704 --> 00:24:18.818
Someone seems to have
taken Dahyun for a while.

285
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:21.849
I'll go find him right away

286
00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:24.991
You can't tell anyone about
my son's disappearance.

287
00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:26.570
Do you understand?

288
00:24:26.718 --> 00:24:28.663
I... I understand.

289
00:24:28.865 --> 00:24:31.575
I understand so go and find him right away.

290
00:24:33.316 --> 00:24:36.987
What should I do, my grandson...

291
00:24:52.705 --> 00:24:54.095
How's your kid?

292
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.199
There's a delivery downstairs.

293
00:25:08.553 --> 00:25:09.865
Do you have anything to sign for?

294
00:25:10.896 --> 00:25:11.896
I don't.

295
00:25:16.318 --> 00:25:19.051
Ask the courier carefully
then just bring up the stuff.

296
00:25:30.275 --> 00:25:31.275
What's that?

297
00:25:40.195 --> 00:25:41.267
Oh my gosh.

298
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.719
It looks like a child's finger.

299
00:25:42.738 --> 00:25:43.822
Crazy bastards.

300
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.558
Mother.

301
00:25:46.567 --> 00:25:47.151
Honey.

302
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.402
- Honey, honey.
- Wait a minute.

303
00:25:48.426 --> 00:25:50.251
- Honey.
- Wait a minute, what's that?

304
00:25:50.436 --> 00:25:52.104
Honey, what is this?

305
00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:53.609
Wait a minute, what is this?

306
00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:54.439
Wait a minute!

307
00:25:54.448 --> 00:25:55.722
Honey!

308
00:25:55.747 --> 00:25:57.361
Wait a minute, what is this?

309
00:25:57.651 --> 00:25:59.472
Ah, please!

310
00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:05.370
Because it's a child's finger,

311
00:26:05.785 --> 00:26:07.783
Computer keyboard, mouse, door knob.

312
00:26:08.287 --> 00:26:10.042
Please check these places.

313
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.060
Yes.

314
00:26:23.939 --> 00:26:26.598
My son folded it so well.

315
00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:29.462
Excuse me.

316
00:26:29.473 --> 00:26:31.701
Can you check this out, too?

317
00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:32.892
Yes, sure.

318
00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:48.978
The deliveryman said he didn't ask
the courier company directly.

319
00:26:49.069 --> 00:26:50.937
Instead, I'm contacting him
directly on Mansu-dong Street

320
00:26:50.962 --> 00:26:52.521
and deliver it to him.

321
00:26:52.706 --> 00:26:53.606
Just in case,

322
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.019
ask the courier to describe
the delivery man's appearance

323
00:26:55.043 --> 00:26:56.370
and continue the investigation.

324
00:26:56.395 --> 00:26:57.395
Okay, got it.

325
00:26:59.463 --> 00:27:00.140
Did you get the results?

326
00:27:00.165 --> 00:27:00.974
Yes.

327
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.833
On Ah-jin's belongings

328
00:27:02.925 --> 00:27:05.379
No fingerprints were found
to match the pinky finger.

329
00:27:05.689 --> 00:27:06.987
What?

330
00:27:07.012 --> 00:27:10.126
The pinky finger that was delivered
is not your daughter's.

331
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:13.389
Then whose finger is that?

332
00:27:15.229 --> 00:27:18.005
Six fingerprints were taken
from your daughter's room.

333
00:27:18.018 --> 00:27:21.995
There's only one fingerprint
that matches that pinky finger.

334
00:27:24.238 --> 00:27:26.776
It's a fingerprint taken from
a child's folded colored paper.

335
00:27:28.242 --> 00:27:30.086
It could be something left
behind by Ah-jin's friend.

336
00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:31.824
Do you know the names of her friends?

337
00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:35.201
Then you mean it's not
our Ah-jin's finger, right?

338
00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:37.036
Yes, that's what it turned out to be.

339
00:27:42.882 --> 00:27:44.659
Why are they putting the other kids' fingers?

340
00:27:45.217 --> 00:27:47.144
That means there are
other abducted children.

341
00:27:49.513 --> 00:27:51.282
Hey, go through all the schools around here.

342
00:27:51.307 --> 00:27:53.123
Start looking for kids who
haven't been to school lately.

343
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.140
Yes, got it.

344
00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:57.878
(Dahyun)

345
00:27:58.273 --> 00:27:59.963
Ah, whose is it?

346
00:28:03.045 --> 00:28:04.325
It's a headache.

347
00:28:12.472 --> 00:28:13.628
What do you want?

348
00:28:14.217 --> 00:28:16.057
<i>That's your son's finger.</i>

349
00:28:16.427 --> 00:28:19.517
<i>Het got naesthetized and disinfected.
Don't worry too much.</i>

350
00:28:21.907 --> 00:28:25.829
I'll find you and I'll kill you.

351
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:27.506
<i>You'd better take their money.</i>

352
00:28:28.093 --> 00:28:29.093
<i>Who knows?</i>

353
00:28:29.385 --> 00:28:33.455
<i>If you could get the money quickly, your
son's fingers might be able to reconnect.</i>

354
00:28:37.686 --> 00:28:38.686
Team leader!

355
00:28:42.682 --> 00:28:43.109
Be ready.

356
00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:43.536
Yes.

357
00:28:45.294 --> 00:28:46.218
Are you ready?

358
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.700
Hello?

359
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.218
<i>Please give the phone to
the person in charge there.</i>

360
00:28:55.809 --> 00:28:59.022
<i>I don't want to listen to
your acting skills anymore.</i>

361
00:29:07.643 --> 00:29:08.643
Tell me.

362
00:29:08.643 --> 00:29:11.916
<i>Ask the person who plays the fake
mother to bring the money herself.</i>

363
00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:15.562
<i>Her parents are still too inexperienced.</i>

364
00:29:17.078 --> 00:29:19.043
Put the money in the car first
and wait for my message.

365
00:29:19.613 --> 00:29:20.822
<i>I will call again.</i>

366
00:29:26.685 --> 00:29:29.108
<i>He knew she was a double from the start.</i>

367
00:29:36.171 --> 00:29:40.189
I'm counting on you for my Ah-jin's safety.

368
00:29:58.816 --> 00:30:00.310
Don't cry.

369
00:30:01.362 --> 00:30:05.808
I gradually can't remember
the faces of my parents.

370
00:30:06.402 --> 00:30:10.714
It's all right. They're gonna come for us.

371
00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:15.342
My mom is a police officer.

372
00:30:20.998 --> 00:30:22.939
We'll follow you at a
distance of about 100 meters.

373
00:30:22.949 --> 00:30:24.704
I've also installed a tracking
device in the money case.

374
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.430
So we can keep track of your location.

375
00:30:41.811 --> 00:30:42.574
Hello?

376
00:30:42.578 --> 00:30:46.533
<i>Drive on route 42 and
come to Wonhyeon Station.</i>

377
00:30:50.147 --> 00:30:51.779
He said to drive from route 42.

378
00:30:51.792 --> 00:30:53.316
Then go to Wonhyeon Station.

379
00:30:53.695 --> 00:30:54.553
Take care.

380
00:30:54.556 --> 00:30:55.068
Let's go.

381
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.597
Yes.

382
00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:56.771
Let's go!

383
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:32.751
Hello?

384
00:31:32.802 --> 00:31:34.610
<i>I will say the transaction location again.</i>

385
00:31:35.405 --> 00:31:36.914
<i>I'll never contact you again.</i>

386
00:31:37.701 --> 00:31:39.907
<i>You need to get rid of your colleagues.</i>

387
00:31:41.036 --> 00:31:44.909
<i>Because you will decide
the life and death of two kids.</i>

388
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:47.812
Where should I go?

389
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.776
Looks like the kidnapper
noticed the tracking vehicle.

390
00:31:59.096 --> 00:32:02.415
He said if I wasn't there
alone, he'd cut the deal.

391
00:32:02.808 --> 00:32:04.706
Then we'll stop following and use the locator.

392
00:32:22.842 --> 00:32:24.552
Go to the route 42 first and we will catch up.

393
00:32:31.127 --> 00:32:32.738
A cash-laden vehicle is passing Wonhyeon Station.

394
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.611
It's heading towards Siheung.

395
00:32:59.929 --> 00:33:01.609
Wait. Where is she going?

396
00:33:02.075 --> 00:33:03.122
What's going on?

397
00:33:03.702 --> 00:33:04.702
Yoon So-Eun.

398
00:33:06.158 --> 00:33:07.158
Yoon So-Eun.

399
00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.657
Yoon So-Eun, answer me!

400
00:33:11.418 --> 00:33:12.679
(Police Sergeant Yoon So-Eun)

401
00:33:15.382 --> 00:33:16.723
<i>The number you have
dialed is now unattended.</i>

402
00:33:16.748 --> 00:33:18.428
What's wrong with her?

403
00:33:28.294 --> 00:33:29.294
My goodness.

404
00:33:40.596 --> 00:33:41.334
What's going on?

405
00:33:41.349 --> 00:33:43.387
- Don't move.
- Why, why?

406
00:33:43.423 --> 00:33:45.591
It hurts so much. Why me?

407
00:33:49.496 --> 00:33:50.919
Nam-soo, did you find anything?

408
00:33:51.108 --> 00:33:52.221
There's nothing suspicious.

409
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.307
I found the tracking device!

410
00:34:06.777 --> 00:34:07.777
What?

411
00:34:07.933 --> 00:34:09.615
Did Sergeant Yoon ditch us?

412
00:34:13.978 --> 00:34:15.418
What is she doing?

413
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:23.591
(Jeong Dahyun's kidnapping case progress)

414
00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:43.390
Where's my son?

415
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.001
<i>He's fine next to me.</i>

416
00:34:47.153 --> 00:34:48.417
Send my son here first.

417
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.014
Then I'll put down the money
and leave the place quietly.

418
00:34:50.024 --> 00:34:52.716
<i>No, you'll give the money first,
and then I'll let the kid go.</i>

419
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.922
<i>Otherwise, we'll cancel the transaction.</i>

420
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.114
Didn't I bring 300 million won?

421
00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:59.512
You have to take this.

422
00:34:59.696 --> 00:35:02.245
Mom! Mom! Mom!

423
00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:03.253
Dahyun!

424
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.260
Mom!

425
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.786
Mom, don't come here! Don't!

426
00:35:17.506 --> 00:35:19.017
Mom!

427
00:35:19.734 --> 00:35:21.026
No, don't.

428
00:35:21.038 --> 00:35:22.735
No, don't do it.

429
00:35:22.738 --> 00:35:25.069
No, I don't want.

430
00:35:33.741 --> 00:35:35.784
I'm so scared.

431
00:35:48.387 --> 00:35:49.849
<i>Put the money case in front of you.</i>

432
00:35:49.874 --> 00:35:50.936

Please.

449
00:36:27.242 --> 00:36:29.331
Please, send back my son.

450
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:31.114
Isn't there 300 million won here?

451
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.732
I've got the money.

452
00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:34.721
Please stop it now.

453
00:36:34.728 --> 00:36:36.008

I don't know.

Hurry up and tell me.

461
00:38:54.526 --> 00:38:56.436
If you have the courage,
come on and stab me.

462
00:39:03.558 --> 00:39:04.467
What?

463
00:39:04.813 --> 00:39:06.443
Are you threatening me?

464
00:39:06.468 --> 00:39:07.165
Are you?

465
00:39:14.545 --> 00:39:15.665
What the fuck?

466
00:39:17.577 --> 00:39:19.430
Have you forgotten your medication again?

467
00:39:19.866 --> 00:39:21.484
The bitch saw your face.

468
00:39:21.677 --> 00:39:22.897
So I had to kill her. What do you mean I have

469
00:39:22.921 --> 00:39:24.140
forgotten my fucking medication, dumbass!

470
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:25.997
She's bleeding. She's already bleeding!

471
00:39:26.406 --> 00:39:27.406
Huh?

472
00:39:27.586 --> 00:39:28.866
What's going on?

473
00:39:47.033 --> 00:39:48.636
Won't you get yourself together?

474
00:39:50.315 --> 00:39:51.379
Get the money away.

475
00:40:01.077 --> 00:40:02.077
Go.

476
00:40:05.643 --> 00:40:07.109
Myung-sun, take the child back.

Kid, are you all right?

481
00:41:16.194 --> 00:41:17.314
Do you perhaps

482
00:41:17.737 --> 00:41:19.063
saw a boy of your age?

483
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.673
Huh?

484
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:21.094
A boy your age.

485
00:41:21.472 --> 00:41:22.435
His name is Dahyun.

486
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.356
It's all right, it's all right.

487
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.705
I'm a police officer.

488
00:41:28.498 --> 00:41:30.270
You're Ah-jin, aren't you?

489
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.460
It's all right.

490
00:41:31.591 --> 00:41:33.677
Do you perhaps saw a boy of your age?

491
00:41:33.803 --> 00:41:34.803
His name is Dahyun.

492
00:41:36.992 --> 00:41:40.015
Dahyun...

493
00:41:40.344 --> 00:41:40.915
What?

494
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.422
Dahyun told me you will come to find him.

495
00:41:54.335 --> 00:41:55.335
It's all right.

496
00:42:17.525 --> 00:42:19.113
I have found the kid.

497
00:42:20.145 --> 00:42:22.038
I'll send you the location.

498
00:42:41.654 --> 00:42:42.701
Just hang in there a little more.

499
00:42:42.906 --> 00:42:44.616
The police will be here soon.

500
00:42:44.641 --> 00:42:45.265

My Ah-jin!

509
00:43:25.406 --> 00:43:27.649
She was sedated and fell asleep.

510
00:43:28.243 --> 00:43:29.978
I don't know until I have a thorough examination.

511
00:43:29.982 --> 00:43:31.340
But it's a good thing she's not traumatized.

512
00:43:31.561 --> 00:43:32.561
Thank you.

513
00:43:33.157 --> 00:43:34.157
But...

514
00:43:34.485 --> 00:43:36.560
She seems to have been hit hard mentally.

515
00:43:37.405 --> 00:43:40.256
She couldn't say anything about

516
00:43:40.609 --> 00:43:41.821
where she was or what happened.

517
00:43:46.183 --> 00:43:50.109
She has traces of surgery in her abdomen.
Is it perhaps the liver?

518

Yes.

519
00:43:54.793 --> 00:43:57.327
She... had a transplant before.

520
00:44:48.339 --> 00:44:49.339

That police lady...

522
00:44:51.993 --> 00:44:56.013
She betrayed her colleague
and gave us the money.

523
00:44:56.139 --> 00:44:58.610
But she didn't find her
kid herself and fell down.

524
00:44:58.635 --> 00:45:00.727
Damn that policewoman.

525
00:45:01.377 --> 00:45:03.470
I can't wait to get her internal organs out.

526
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.061
I'll go to the convenience store.

527
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.467
Do you want me to buy
you anything you need?

528
00:46:17.943 --> 00:46:19.893
No, thank you.
I'm all right.

529
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.450
What are you doing now?

530
00:46:42.457 --> 00:46:43.538
Where are they?

531

Which kidnapper will let the hostage go?

533
00:46:46.629 --> 00:46:48.543

my appearance and address.

00:46:51.154 --> 00:46:53.329
Are you saying I kidnapped my own daughter?

536

Where are they?

537
00:47:00.857 --> 00:47:01.857
Tell me.

538
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:04.347
Tell me.

539
00:47:05.043 --> 00:47:06.043
Tell me!

540
00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:09.825
Anyway,

541

in a car accident a few days ago.

from the hospital tomorrow

has an eye for money?

There's no description of the kidnapper's
appearance or where she was abducted.

567

the kidnapping case are accomplices.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:14.093
(Team leader Kang Sung-chan)

726
01:07:15.126 --> 01:07:17.544
(What should I do with your child?)

727
01:07:36.179 --> 01:07:37.405
Where's my son?

728
01:07:40.068 --> 01:07:40.945
You're amazing.

729
01:07:41.168 --> 01:07:42.458
So you're a female.

730
01:07:42.904 --> 01:07:44.323
Now do as I say

731
01:07:45.282 --> 01:07:46.996
so that you can save your son.

732
01:07:48.512 --> 01:07:49.956
I will tell you the location.

733
01:08:09.682 --> 01:08:11.654
M... om

734
01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:13.862
You're going to see Mom.

735
01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:17.090
Is there anything you want to tell Mom?

736
01:08:17.965 --> 01:08:19.363
I...

737
01:08:19.387 --> 01:08:21.386
...will...

738
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.454
...tell Mom myself.

739
01:08:44.969 --> 01:08:46.722
When did you start working together?

740
01:08:50.196 --> 01:08:51.716
When he was nine.

741
01:08:54.135 --> 01:08:57.487
He stole Dad's wallet to
buy me a birthday present.

742
01:08:58.239 --> 01:09:00.158
He was beaten to death by a baseball bat.

743
01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:04.903
He was knocked unconscious
and threw hot water over him.

744
01:09:07.675 --> 01:09:09.103
So that night,

745
01:09:09.491 --> 01:09:12.305
I threw hydrochloric acid on my
dad's face while he was sleeping.

746
01:09:15.038 --> 01:09:17.216
Then I left the house with Junyong.

747
01:09:18.036 --> 01:09:22.317
We've been together since then.

748
01:10:24.067 --> 01:10:25.519
Why are you hiding there?

749
01:10:29.033 --> 01:10:30.146
Police lady!

750
01:10:31.225 --> 01:10:33.149
I know you're hiding there.

751
01:10:38.506 --> 01:10:40.402
Are you digging for your own grave?

752
01:10:40.784 --> 01:10:41.784
Huh?

753
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.361
I can see your hair.

754
01:11:00.892 --> 01:11:03.137
Hide well.

755
01:11:03.142 --> 01:11:06.665
I can see you hair.

756
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:15.536
Where did she go?

757
01:11:57.617 --> 01:11:58.911
Are you looking for your son?

758
01:12:00.842 --> 01:12:02.222
Are you looking for your son?

759
01:12:03.407 --> 01:12:06.603
Go straight down the hill.
We hid him in the dock.

760
01:12:07.204 --> 01:12:08.340
But...

761
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:12.411
Can you...

762
01:12:14.639 --> 01:12:17.561
Can you find him, after all?

763
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:21.810
This bitch.

764
01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.255
Damn, this bitch.

765
01:13:53.213 --> 01:13:54.635
How did you come here?

766
01:13:55.317 --> 01:13:57.075
Ah-jin is still in our hands.

767
01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:08.609
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

768
01:14:09.877 --> 01:14:11.199
You already know it.

769
01:14:13.272 --> 01:14:14.700
That's a sinful thing.

770
01:14:17.366 --> 01:14:19.010
If you'd known...

771
01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:27.514
you shouldn't have saved Ah-jin.

772
01:14:28.491 --> 01:14:33.238
Ah-jin's life was bought
with the lives of other children.

773
01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:41.248
The supervision in the
Philippines has become stricter.

774
01:14:44.075 --> 01:14:46.791
Do you understand what I mean?

775
01:14:53.167 --> 01:14:54.687
Don't touch my daughter.

776
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:01.205
Don't touch the other kids, too.

777
01:15:04.545 --> 01:15:05.545
Other kids?

778
01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:13.107
The other kids you need for kidnapping.

779
01:15:15.963 --> 01:15:17.809
So give back the other kids.

780
01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:17.725
Your husband confessed to me.

781
01:16:18.127 --> 01:16:20.818
That Ah-jin had an organ
transplant in the Philippines.

782
01:16:23.311 --> 01:16:27.121
But you got that organ.

783
01:16:28.462 --> 01:16:32.932
We're searching the
kidnapper's lair right now.

784
01:16:34.435 --> 01:16:35.581
According to the counselor,

785
01:16:36.574 --> 01:16:38.913
Sergant Yoon So-eun was among them.

786
01:16:44.437 --> 01:16:47.522
Now, stop and confess the truth.

787
01:16:50.905 --> 01:16:52.096
I...

788
01:16:53.996 --> 01:16:55.596
don't know anything.

789
01:17:03.589 --> 01:17:04.684
Mrs. Hong Yeon-joo.

790
01:17:06.181 --> 01:17:09.984
You are under arrest under allegedly
trafficking in organs and kidnapping children.

791
01:17:12.723 --> 01:17:15.913
You have the right to remain
silent and to have a lawyer.

792
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:18.819
Everything you say will be
evidence against you in court.

793
01:17:32.974 --> 01:17:36.033
That kid's in bad shape. Is that all right?

794
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:37.510
Stay still.

795
01:17:37.816 --> 01:17:39.718
We have no time. Let's go now.

796
01:17:40.084 --> 01:17:41.084
Just wait!

797
01:17:47.884 --> 01:17:49.013
They've ran away.

798
01:17:52.555 --> 01:17:53.640
Shit.

799
01:17:57.493 --> 01:17:59.732
(Team leader, I'm sorry for not explaining clearly..
I'm at the port of Haejin on Ganghwa Island.)

800
01:18:06.275 --> 01:18:07.403
Goodness.

801
01:18:14.838 --> 01:18:15.422
Damn it.

802
01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:43.746
<i>I investigated the woman Hong
Yeon-joo mentioned, Seo Hye-jin.</i>

803
01:18:44.065 --> 01:18:46.594
She's been a health
teacher in many schools.

804
01:18:47.205 --> 01:18:49.550
Seo Hye-jin's transfer date coincides with the

805
01:18:49.574 --> 01:18:51.918
disappearance of elementary school students.

806
01:18:53.449 --> 01:18:54.713
That bitch, really.

807
01:19:08.256 --> 01:19:09.808
Where's my son?

808
01:19:15.642 --> 01:19:16.912
Hey!

809
01:19:17.714 --> 01:19:18.510
That bastard.

810
01:19:19.548 --> 01:19:20.548
Damn it.

811
01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.445
This crazy bitch.

812
01:19:25.398 --> 01:19:26.398
Damn it.

813
01:19:59.612 --> 01:20:00.713
Where's my brother?

814
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:04.247
I killed him.

815
01:20:36.429 --> 01:20:38.032
You crazy bitch.

816
01:20:41.168 --> 01:20:43.653
How dare you kill my brother?

817
01:20:53.357 --> 01:20:55.206
A mom like you...

818
01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.003
I'm not afraid of anything.

819
01:20:59.976 --> 01:21:01.530
You're risking your life

820
01:21:02.203 --> 01:21:04.834
because you're worried
about to happen to your son.

821
01:22:32.642 --> 01:22:34.162
Dahyun, mom's here.

822
01:22:35.294 --> 01:22:36.500
My Dahyun.

823
01:22:42.205 --> 01:22:43.407
Let's go home.

824
01:22:46.206 --> 01:22:47.280
Let's go home.

825
01:22:53.332 --> 01:22:54.452
<i>Breaking News.</i>

826
01:22:54.523 --> 01:22:57.039
<i>Sergeant Yoon So-eun of
Incheon Central Police Station,</i>

827
01:22:57.064 --> 01:22:59.795

<i>At the same place, the police found

<i>She's a member of a criminal organization
involved in transnational child organ trafficking.</i>

832
01:23:15.092 --> 01:23:18.118
<i>The police will launch an intensive
investigation to find out who's behind it.</i>

833
01:23:47.236 --> 01:23:49.700
The result of the report
of the missing child case

834
01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:52.223
58% not found after 12 hours

835
01:23:52.248 --> 01:23:55.142
68% after 24 hours

836

After a week, it goes up to 89%
